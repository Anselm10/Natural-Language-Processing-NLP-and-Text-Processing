0,Multiple factors make it a candidate wellsuited for further study using NASAs James Webb Space Telescope
1,Hurt CaltechIPAC TESS stares at a large swath of the sky for about a month at a time tracking the brightness changes of tens of thousands of stars at intervals ranging from  seconds to  minutes
2,Capturing transits  brief regular dimmings of stars caused by the passage of orbiting worlds  is one of the missions primary goals
3,Although we dont yet know whether it possesses an atmosphere weve been thinking of it as an exoVenus with similar size and energy received from its star as our planetary neighbor in the solar system
4,The host star called Gliese  is a cool red dwarf located almost  lightyears away in the constellation Pisces
5,The star is only about  of the Suns size with about  of the Suns surface temperature
6,days and is Earths size or slightly smaller  comparable to Venus
7,Assuming it has no atmosphere the planet has a surface temperature estimated at around  degrees Fahrenheit  degrees Celsius
8,Astronomers say that the diminutive sizes and masses of red dwarf stars make them ideal for finding Earthsize planets
9,A smaller star means greater dimming for each transit and a lower mass means an orbiting planet can produce a greater wobble known as reflex motion of the star
10,Gliese  bs estimated size may be as large as Earth or slightly smaller  comparable to Venus in our solar system
11,This artists concept compares Earth with different possible Gliese  b interpretations from one with no atmosphere to one with a thick Venuslike one
12,This makes it easier to detect transiting planets within habitable zones around red dwarfs than those around stars emitting more energy
13,The distance separating Gliese  and the new planet is just  of the distance between Earth and the Sun
14,Gliese  b represents one of the best targets to study whether Earthsize planets orbiting cool stars can retain their atmospheres a crucial step to advance our understanding of habitability on planets across our galaxy said Shishir Dholakia a doctoral student at the Centre for Astrophysics at the University of Southern Queensland in Australia
15,He coled a different research team with Larissa Palethorpe a doctoral student at the University of Edinburgh and University College London
16,Both teams suggest that studying Gliese  b may help unlock some aspects of our own solar systems evolution
17,It is thought that Earths and Venuss first atmospheres were stripped away and then replenished by volcanic outgassing and bombardments from residual material in the solar system Palethorpe explained
18,The Earth is habitable but Venus is not due to its complete loss of water
19,Because Gliese  b is between Earth and Venus in temperature its atmosphere could teach us a lot about the habitability pathways planets take as they develop
20,One important factor in retaining an atmosphere is the storminess of its star
21,Red dwarfs tend to be magnetically active resulting in frequent powerful Xray flares
22,A paper led by Kuzuhara and Fukui was published May  in The Astrophysical Journal Letters
23,The Dholakia and Palethorpe findings were published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society on the same day
24,During a transit the host stars light passes through any atmosphere
25,Different gas molecules absorb different colors so the transit provides a set of chemical fingerprints that can be detected by telescopes like Webb
26,We know of only a handful of temperate planets similar to Earth that are both close enough to us and meet other criteria needed for this kind of study called transmission spectroscopy using current facilities said Michael McElwain a research astrophysicist at NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt Maryland and a coauthor of the Kuzuhara and Fukui paper
27,To better understand the diversity of atmospheres and evolutionary outcomes for these planets we need more examples like Gliese  b

32,Webbs instruments are so sensitive that they were able to detect an unusual amount of dense gas surrounding these galaxies
33,This gas will likely end up fueling the formation of new stars in the galaxies
34,These galaxies are like sparkling islands in a sea of otherwise neutral opaque gas explained Kasper Heintz the lead author and an assistant professor of astrophysics at the Cosmic Dawn Center DAWN at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark
35,Without Webb we would not be able to observe these very early galaxies let alone learn so much about their formation
36,Were moving away from a picture of galaxies as isolated ecosystems
37,At this stage in the history of the universe galaxies are all intimately connected to the intergalactic medium with its filaments and structures of pristine gas added Simone Nielsen a coauthor and PhD student also based at DAWN
38,This suggests that we are seeing the assembly of neutral hydrogen gas into galaxies
39,That gas will go on to cool clump and form new stars
40,The universe was a very different place several hundred million years after the big bang during a period known as the Era of Reionization
41,Gas throughout the universe only became fully transparent around  billion years after the big bang
42,Galaxies stars contributed to heating and ionizing the gas around them causing the gas to eventually become completely transparent
43,By matching Webbs data to models of star formation the researchers also found that these galaxies primarily have populations of young stars
44,The fact that we are seeing large gas reservoirs also suggests that the galaxies have not had enough time to form most of their stars yet Watson added
45,This is Only the Start Webb is not only meeting the mission goals that drove its development and launch  it is exceeding them
46,Images and data of these distant galaxies were impossible to obtain before Webb explained Gabriel Brammer a coauthor and associate professor at DAWN
47,The next step is to build large statistical samples of galaxies and quantify the prevalence and prominence of their features in detail Heintz said
48,This work has been published in the May   issue of the journal Science
49,The James Webb Space Telescope is the worlds premier space science observatory
50,Webb is solving mysteries in our solar system looking beyond to distant worlds around other stars and probing the mysterious structures and origins of our universe and our place in it

55,That may sound impossible but its actually true said Richard Kelley the U
56,principal investigator for XRISM at NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt Maryland
57,The Resolve instrument gives us a deeper look at the makeup and motion of Xrayemitting objects using technology invented and refined at Goddard over the past several decades
58,XRISM pronounced crism is led by JAXA Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency in collaboration with NASA along with contributions from ESA European Space Agency
59,It launched into orbit last September and has been scrutinizing the cosmos ever since
60,It will probe the universes hottest regions largest structures and objects with the strongest gravity like supermassive black holes in the cores of distant galaxies
61,The device produces a spectrum of Xray sources between  and  electron volts  up to  times the energy of visible light  with unprecedented detail
62,Its detector takes the temperature of each Xray that strikes it said Brian Williams NASAs XRISM project scientist at Goddard
63,We call Resolve a microcalorimeter spectrometer because each of its  pixels is measuring tiny amounts of heat delivered by each incoming Xray allowing us to see the chemical fingerprints of elements making up the sources in unprecedented detail
64,In order to accomplish this the entire detector must be chilled to
65,The instrument is so precise it can detect the motions of elements within a target effectively providing a D view
66,Gas moving toward us glows at slightly higher energies than normal while gas moving away from us emits slightly lower energies
67,This will for example allow scientists to better understand the flow of hot gas within clusters of galaxies and to track the movement of different elements in the debris of supernova explosions
68,Resolve is taking astronomers into a new era of cosmic exploration  and with only threedozen pixels
69,XRISM is a collaborative mission between JAXA and NASA with contributions from over  institutions in Japan the U
70,NASA Goddard developed the Resolve detector and many of the instrument subsystems together with the two Xray Mirror Assemblies

105,billion years ago the universe began with a rapid expansion we call the big bang
106,Nine billion years after the universe began its expansion started to speed up driven by an unknown force that scientists have named dark energy
107,But we do know that it exists its making the universe expand at an accelerating rate and approximately
108,The history of the universe is outlined in this infographic
109,NASA A Brief History It All Started With Cepheids Dark energy wasnt discovered until the late s
110,All Cepheid stars with a certain period a Cepheids period is the time it takes to go from bright to dim and bright again have the same absolute magnitude or luminosity  the amount of light they put out
111,Leavitt measured these stars and proved that there is a relationship between their regular period of brightness and luminosity
112,Leavitts findings made it possible for astronomers to use a stars period and luminosity to measure the distances between us and Cepheid stars in faroff galaxies and our own Milky Way
113,Around this same time in history astronomer Vesto Slipher observed spiral galaxies using his telescopes spectrograph a device that splits light into the colors that make it up much like the way a prism splits light into a rainbow
114,He used the spectrograph a relatively recent invention at the time to see the different wavelengths of light coming from the galaxies in different spectral lines
115,These observations would prove to be critical for many future scientific breakthroughs including the discovery of dark energy
116,Light behaves like a wave and red light has the longest wavelength
117,So the light coming from objects moving away from us has a longer wavelength stretching to the red end of the electromagnetic
118,In the years that followed different scientists around the world started to put the pieces of an expanding universe together
119,In  Russian scientist and mathematician Alexander Friedmann published a paper detailing multiple possibilities for the history of the universe
120,Astronomer Edwin Hubble confirmed that the universe was expanding in  using observations made by his associate astronomer Milton Humason
121,Hubble and Humason then studied Cepheid stars in those galaxies using the stars to determine the distance of their galaxies or nebulae as they called them
122,The pair found that objects like galaxies are moving away from Earth faster the farther away they are at upwards of hundreds of thousands of miles per second  an observation now known as Hubbles Law or the HubbleLematre law
123,This composite image features one of the most complicated and dramatic collisions between galaxy clusters ever seen
124,Known officially as Abell  this system has been dubbed Pandoras Cluster because of the wide variety of different structures found
125,Astronomers think at least four galaxy clusters coming from a variety of directions are involved with this collision
126,These groups were led by astronomers Adam Riess Saul Perlmutter and Brian Schmidt
127,This trio won the  Nobel Prize in Physics for this work
128,So they knew that there must be another factor making these objects appear dimmer
129,Scientists can determine distance and speed using an objects brightness and dimmer objects are typically farther away though surrounding dust and other factors can cause an object to dim
130,This led the scientists to conclude that these supernovae were just much farther away than they expected by looking at their redshifts
131,Using the objects brightness the researchers determined the distance of these supernovae
132,They found that the supernovae were not as close as expected meaning they had traveled farther away from us faster than ancitipated
133,These observations led scientists to ultimately conclude that the universe itself must be expanding faster over time
134,While other possible explanations for these observations have been explored astronomers studying even more distant supernovae or other cosmic phenomena in more recent years continued to gather evidence and build support for the idea that the universe is expanding faster over time a phenomenon now called cosmic acceleration
135,Dark energy has been described by some as having the effect of a negative pressure that is pushing space outward
136,Keep in mind that its possible its something else entirely
137,Originally the constant existed to counterbalance gravity resulting in a static universe
138,They suggested that this additional force would be necessary to accelerate the expansion of the universe
139,According to quantum field theory there are virtual particles or pairs of particles and antiparticles
140,Its thought that these virtual particles cancel each other out almost as soon as they crop up in the universe and that this act of popping in and out of existence could be made possible by vacuum energy that fills the cosmos and pushes space outward
141,This means that the amount of vacuum energy in the cosmos must be much smaller than it is in these predictions
142,Quintessence Some scientists think that dark energy could be a type of energy fluid or field that fills space behaves in an opposite way to normal matter and can vary in its amount and distribution throughout both time and space
143,This hypothesized version of dark energy has been nicknamed quintessence after the theoretical fifth element discussed by ancient Greek philosophers
144,Its even been suggested by some scientists that quintessence could be some combination of dark energy and dark matter though the two are currently considered completely separate from one another
145,While the two are both major mysteries to scientists dark matter is thought to make up about  of all matter in the universe
146,A Flaw in General Relativity Some scientists think that dark energy isnt something physical that we can discover
147,Within this explanation scientists think that its possible to modify our understanding of gravity in a way that explains observations of the universe made without the need for dark energy
148,Einstein actually proposed such an idea in  called unimodular gravity a modified version of general relativity that scientists today think wouldnt require dark energy to make sense of the universe
149,The Future Dark energy is one of the great mysteries of the universe
150,This map will include observations of billions of galaxies found up to  billion lightyears from Earth
151,NASAs Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope set to launch by May  is designed to investigate dark energy among many other science topics and will also create a D dark matter map
152,Romans resolution will be as sharp as NASAs Hubble Space Telescopes but with a field of view  times larger allowing it to capture more expansive images of the universe
153,Roman will also conduct an additional survey to detect Type Ia supernovae In addition to NASAs missions and efforts the Vera C
154,Rubin Observatory supported by a large collaboration that includes the U
155,Additionally NASAs James Webb Space Telescope launched in  the worlds most powerful and largest space telescope aims to make contributions to several areas of research and will contribute to studies of dark energy
156,NASAs SPHEREx the SpectroPhotometer for the History of the Universe Epoch of Reionization and Ices Explorer mission scheduled to launch no later than April  aims to investigate the origins of the universe
157,A brief note Lastly to clarify dark energy is not the same as dark matter
158,Credit Ed Bell for Simons Foundation The Discovery A planet that could resemble a smaller version of our own Neptune orbits one of two Sunlike stars that also orbit each other
159,The planet dwells in the habitable zone with a potentially moderate temperature and poses a challenge to prevailing ideas of planet formation
160,Key Facts Astronomers once imagined that our solar system  with its middleaged quiet Sun hosting small rocky planets in closer orbits and gas giants farther out  might be typical even runofthemill
161,But so far in an era of increasingly powerful planethunting technology its turning out to be anything but
162,Other planetary systems can look very different if not downright weird or are we the weird ones
163,A system called TOI  seems truly strange a mysterious type of planet known as a miniNeptune traces an Earthlike day orbit around one of two stars locked in their own orbital embrace
164,Details Among the thousands of exoplanets  planets beyond our solar system  confirmed in our galaxy so far most were detected using the transit method measuring the tiny dip in starlight as a planet crosses the face of its star
165,And most of these transit detections involve planets with short orbits their years  once around the star  lasting a few days or weeks
166,So the detection of planet TOI  c was a welcome departure
167,That isnt only because its day orbit places it in fairly exclusive company  transiting planets found so far with years longer than  days and only  over  days
168,The planet detected using TESS the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite also orbits in the habitable zone the distance from a star that could allow liquid water to form on a planetary surface
169,For planet c of course thats almost certainly not the case it most likely has a large dense atmosphere perhaps similar to Neptunes that would rule out surface water
170,The longer a planets orbital period the more likely it is to host a satellite so it isnt difficult to imagine a potentially habitable moon  la the fictional Pandora
171,The brightness of this system could make it a likely target in the continuing search for such exomoons
172,Measurements using a second detection method revealed a possible sibling planet with a day orbit
173,This one does not from Earths perspective cross the face of its star so its potential presence was revealed by radial velocity
174,The light coming from a star shifts slightly to and fro as the gravity of an orbiting planet tugs it one way then another followup investigations will be needed to confirm that the sibling planet suggested by radial velocity measurements is really there
175,Further investigation of this system also could prove important for understanding binary star systems or pairs of stars that orbit each other
176,A companion star in this case orbits the primary star in just  years allowing them to approach each other closely by interstellar standards
177,Scientists investigating the system also got an assist from more than a century ago archival data that was part of the Washington Double Star Catalog maintained by the U

181,MIN READ Discovery Alert An Earthsized World and Its Ultracool Star An artists concept of the exoplanet SPECULOOS b orbiting its red dwarf star
182,The planet is as big around as Earth while its star is slightly bigger than Jupiter  but much more massive
183,Credit NASAJPLCaltech Our galaxy is a jewel box of red stars
184,More than  of the stars in the Milky Way are M dwarfs also known as red dwarfs
185,These stars are cool and dim compared with our Sun but they often blast orbiting exoplanets with highenergy radiation especially early in their lives
186,Stars like our Sun burn for about  billion years before turning into hungry red giants devouring any planets too nearby
187,M dwarfs keep burning for  billion years or more perhaps offering a foothold for life and an even longer window for life to develop
188,An international team using robotic telescopes around the world recently spotted an Earthsized planet orbiting an ultracool red dwarf the dimmest and longestlived of stars
189,A year there one orbit around the star takes about  hours
190,The days and nights though may never end The planet is thought to be tidally locked so the same side known as the dayside always faces the star like the Moon to Earth
191,The Details In our corner of the galaxy ultracool dwarf stars are ubiquitous
192,They are so faint that their planetary population is largely unexplored
193,The SPECULOOS Search for Planets EClipsing ULtracOOl Stars project led by Michael Gillon at the University of Lige Belgium was designed to change that
194,Ultracool dwarf stars are scattered across the sky so you need to observe them one by one for weeks to get a good chance to detect transiting planets
195,For that you need a dedicated network of professional telescopes
196,We designed SPECULOOS specifically to explore nearby ultracool dwarf stars in search of rocky planets Gillon said
197,With the SPECULOOS prototype and the crucial help of the NASA Spitzer Space Telescope we discovered the famous TRAPPIST system
198,That was an excellent start Gillon is the lead author of the paper announcing the planets discovery published May   in Nature Astronomy
199,The project is a true international endeavor with partnership with the Universities of Cambridge Birmingham Bern Massachusetts Institute of Technology and ETH Zrich
200,The SPECULOOS star is thousands of degrees cooler than our Sun with an average temperature of about  F  C but it pummels its planet with radiation meaning theres likely no atmosphere
201,Seeing the star let alone the planet is a feat in itself
202,Though this particular red dwarf is more than a thousand times dimmer than the Sun its planet orbits much much closer than the Earth heating up the planetary surface said coauthor Catherine Clark a postdoctoral researcher at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California
203,Fun facts While the planet is as big around as Earth its star is just a tad bigger than Jupiter  but much more massive
204,The planet receives almost  times more energy per second than Earth receives from the Sun
205,Did you catch the cookie connection The planetfinding program SPECULOOS shares its name with the spiced shortbread
206,Sweet  The Next Steps SPECULOOS b is an excellent candidate for followup observations by the James Webb Space Telescope
207,Not only might we learn about the potential for an atmosphere and about the surface mineralogy but it might also help us understand the stellar neighborhood and our place in it
208,Were making great strides in our study of planets orbiting other stars
209,The next step will be to determine whether any of them are habitable or even inhabited said Steve B

212,Scattered across the universe black holes are objects with gravity so powerful nothing can escape their grasp
213,Seen nearly edgewise the turbulent disk of gas churning around a black hole takes on a bizarre doublehumped appearance
214,NASAs Goddard Space Flight CenterJeremy Schnittman Scientists have theorized about the existence of black holes since the th century
215,Now astronomers have a growing understanding of these strange gravitational powerhouses that form from the collapsed cores of dying stars
216,While scientists have dramatically improved our understanding of black holes since that first detection these objects remain quite mysterious
217,This is in part because light cant escape from a black hole so they cannot be observed directly with telescopes
218,Instead astronomers primarily look for the ways that black holes influence and distort matter around them
219,While there are objects just as massive as some black holes they dont have the same density
220,Black holes are extremely massive but that mass is concentrated in a smaller area creating a high density that increases the maximum force of a black holes gravity by allowing objects to get very close to all of that mass
221,So tidal forces refer to the distortion of one object by another due to the difference in the gravitational pull on the near and far side of an object
222,Due to a black holes extreme density objects in its vicinity will experience extreme gravity and hence extreme tidal forces that can even pull the object apart
223,Watch eight model stars stretch and deform as they approach a virtual black hole  million times the mass of the Sun
224,The black hole rips some stars apart into a stream of gas a phenomenon called a tidal disruption event
225,For any object falling into a black hole the part closer to the black hole will feel a stronger gravitational pull than the part farther away from the black hole
226,This difference in gravitational pull increases as the object gets closer to the event horizon
227,The difference in gravitational pull isnt unique to black holes but their extreme density creates an extreme effect
228,This effect essentially stretches out the object more and more as the object gets closer to the black hole creating a long thin shape
229,In the book Hawking describes a fictional astronauts journey into a black holes event horizon
230,Just as gravity close to a black hole can stretch things out it can also flatten objects like pancakes
231,This is a phenomenon known as pancake detonation that primarily happens with supermassive black holes
232,In this phenomenon stars that get too close to these black holes will be flattened and compressed by tidal forces
233,This shortlived pancake distortion is followed by an explosive release of thermonuclear energy
234,This happens because massive objects like black holes create strong gravitational fields that curve and stretch the fabric of spacetime
235,We actually experience a very small amount of time dilation here on Earth because of Earths gravity
236,Astronauts living on the International Space Station also experience time at a slightly different rate because they are further from the gravitational pull of the Earth
237,To imagine time dilation in action picture an object traveling towards a black hole
238,As the object approaches the event horizon it appears to start moving infinitely slower until the object will appear completely frozen
239,Here gas and dust will collect swirl and flatten into this pancakeshaped disk
240,Matter in an accretion disk will continue to swirl and fall toward the event horizon of a black hole
241,As an object gets closer and closer the gravitational force will intensify and the matter will continue to be pulled apart and spaghettify
242,By its very nature a black hole cannot be seen but the hot disk of material that encircles it shines bright
243,Against that bright backdrop a black hole can appear to cast a shadow
244,In April  an international network of radio telescopes called the Event Horizon Telescope EHT captured this image of a black hole and its shadow for the first time
245,As matter in an accretion disk falls further inward towards a black hole it swirls around and the friction from this movement can create light ranging from radio waves to visible light and Xrays
246,Sometimes black holes can even redirect some of that infalling matter into jets of highspeed particles traveling away from the black hole that can emit gamma rays
247,Astronomers can use these jets of radiation to find black holes
248,All in all matter near a black hole can be spaghettified superheated squeezed pancaked pulled apart and swirled around all while time itself stretches in unusual ways
249,This is one part of the story that remains a mystery
250,NASA ESA CSA Ralf Crawford STScI The Problem with WASP b At more than threequarters the volume of Jupiter but less than onetenth the mass the warm Neptune exoplanet WASP b is one of the least dense planets known
251,While puffy planets are not uncommon most are hotter and more massive and therefore easier to explain
252,Based on its radius mass age and assumed internal temperature we thought WASP b had a very small rocky core surrounded by a huge mass of hydrogen and helium explained Luis Welbanks from Arizona State University ASU lead author on a paper published today in Nature
253,If WASP b instead has more of its mass in the core the atmosphere should have contracted as the planet cooled over time since it formed
254,Without a source of heat to reexpand the gas the planet should be much smaller
255,Although WASP b has an orbital distance of just  million miles oneseventh the distance between Mercury and the Sun it doesnt receive enough energy from its star to be so inflated
256,WASP b is such an interesting target for Webb because its significantly cooler and more Neptunelike in mass than many of the other lowdensity planets the hot Jupiters weve been studying said David Sing from the Johns Hopkins University JHU lead author on a parallel study also published today in Nature
257,As a result we should be able to detect methane and other molecules that can give us information about its chemistry and internal dynamics that we cant get from a hotter planet
258,Combining observations from Webbs NIRCam NearInfrared Camera Webbs MIRI MidInfrared Instrument and Hubbles WFC Wide Field Camera  Welbanks team was able to build a broad spectrum of
259,Using Webbs NIRSpec NearInfrared Spectrograph Sings team built an independent spectrum covering
260,The precision of the data makes it possible to not just detect but actually measure the abundances of a wealth of molecules including water vapor HO methane CH carbon dioxide CO carbon monoxide CO sulfur dioxide SO and ammonia NH
261,The spectrum includes light collected over four separate observations using a total of three different instruments Hubbles WFC Wide Field Camera  Grism Spectrometer in green Webbs NIRCam NearInfrared Camera Grism Spectrometer in orange and Webbs MIRI MidInfrared Instrument LowResolution Spectrometer in pink
262,This is evidence that hot gas from deep in the planet must be mixing vigorously with the cooler layers higher up explained Sing
263,The fact that we detected so little even though we did detect other carbonbearing molecules tells us that the interior of the planet must be significantly hotter than we thought
264,A likely source of WASP bs extra internal energy is tidal heating caused by its slightly elliptical orbit
265,With the distance between the star and planet changing continuously over the
266,day orbit the gravitational pull is also changing stretching the planet and heating it up
267,Researchers had previously proposed that tidal heating could be the cause of WASP bs puffiness but until the Webb results were in there was no evidence
268,Once they established that the planet has enough internal heat to thoroughly churn up the atmosphere the teams realized that the spectra could also provide a new way to estimate the size of the core
269,All together WASP b is not as mysterious as it once appeared
270,The Webb data tells us that planets like WASP b didnt have to form in some odd way with a super small core and a huge gassy envelope explained Mike Line from ASU
271,Instead we can take something more like Neptune with a lot of rock and not as much gas just dial up the temperature and poof it up to look the way it does
272,The James Webb Space Telescope is the worlds premier space science observatory
273,Webb is solving mysteries in our solar system looking beyond to distant worlds around other stars and probing the mysterious structures and origins of our universe and our place in it
274,Webb is an international program led by NASA with its partners ESA European Space Agency and CSA Canadian Space Agency

279,In this visualization of a flight toward a supermassive black hole labels highlight many of the fascinating features produced by the effects of general relativity along the way
280,Produced on a NASA supercomputer the simulation tracks a camera as it approaches briefly orbits and then crosses the event horizon  the point of no return  of a monster black hole much like the one at the center of our galaxy
281,Explainer videos act as sightseeing guides illuminating the bizarre effects of Einsteins general theory of relativity
282,Versions rendered as degree videos let viewers look all around during the trip while others play as flat allsky maps
283,To create the visualizations Schnittman teamed up with fellow Goddard scientist Brian Powell and used the Discover supercomputer at the NASA Center for Climate Simulation
284,The project generated about  terabytes of data  equivalent to roughly half of the estimated text content in the Library of Congress  and took about  days running on just
285,The same feat would take more than a decade on a typical laptop
286,million times the mass of our Sun equivalent to the monster located at the center of our Milky Way galaxy
287,If you have the choice you want to fall into a supermassive black hole Schnittman explained
288,This occurs because the gravitational pull on the end of an object nearer the black hole is much stronger than that on the other end
289,Infalling objects stretch out like noodles a process astrophysicists call spaghettification
290,The simulated black holes event horizon spans about  million miles  million kilometers or about  of the distance from Earth to the Sun
291,A flat swirling cloud of hot glowing gas called an accretion disk surrounds it and serves as a visual reference during the fall
292,A backdrop of the starry sky as seen from Earth completes the scene
293,Tour an alternative visualization that tracks a camera as it approaches falls toward briefly orbits and escapes a supermassive black hole
294,This immersive degree version allows viewers to look around during the flight
295,Powell View the flyby explainer on YouTube As the camera approaches the black hole reaching speeds ever closer to that of light itself the glow from the accretion disk and background stars becomes amplified in much the same way as the sound of an oncoming racecar rises in pitch
296,The movies begin with the camera located nearly  million miles  million kilometers away with the black hole quickly filling the view
297,Along the way the black holes disk photon rings and the night sky become increasingly distorted  and even form multiple images as their light traverses the increasingly warped spacetime
298,In real time the camera takes about  hours to fall to the event horizon executing almost two complete minute orbits along the way
299,But to anyone observing from afar it would never quite get there
300,As spacetime becomes ever more distorted closer to the horizon the image of the camera would slow and then seem to freeze just shy of it
301,At the event horizon even spacetime itself flows inward at the speed of light the cosmic speed limit
302,Once the camera crosses the horizon its destruction by spaghettification is just
303,This final leg of the voyage is over in the blink of an eye
304,In the alternative scenario the camera orbits close to the event horizon but it never crosses over and escapes to safety

307,MIN READ NASA Collaborating on Europeanled Gravitational Wave Observatory in Space The LISA Laser Interferometer Space Antenna mission led by ESA European Space Agency with NASA contributions will detect gravitational waves in space using three spacecraft separated by more than a million miles flying in a triangular formation
308,AEIMMExozet The first spacebased observatory designed to detect gravitational waves has passed a major review and will proceed to the construction of flight hardware
309,ESA European Space Agency announced the formal adoption of LISA the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna to its mission lineup with launch slated for the mids
310,ESA leads the mission with NASA serving as a collaborative partner
311,In  the groundbased LIGO observatory cracked open the window into gravitational waves disturbances that sweep across spacetime the fabric of our universe said Mark Clampin director of the Astrophysics Division at NASA Headquarters in Washington
312,LISA will give us a panoramic view allowing us to observe a broad range of sources both within our galaxy and far far beyond it
313,Were proud to be part of this international effort to open new avenues to explore the secrets of the universe
314,The LISA mission will enable observations of gravitational waves produced by merging supermassive black holes seen here in a computer simulation
315,Most big galaxies contain central black holes weighing millions of times the mass of our Sun
316,Credit NASAs Goddard Space Flight CenterScott Noble simulation data dAscoli et al
317,NASA will provide several key components of LISAs instrument suite along with science and engineering support
318,NASA contributions include lasers telescopes and devices to reduce disturbances from electromagnetic charges
319,LISA will use this equipment as it measures precise distance changes caused by gravitational waves over millions of miles in space
320,ESA will provide the spacecraft and oversee the international team during the development and operation of the mission
321,Gravitational waves were predicted by Albert Einsteins general theory of relativity more than a century ago
322,They are produced by accelerating masses such as a pair of orbiting black holes
323,Because these waves remove orbital energy the distance between the objects gradually shrinks over millions of years and they ultimately merge
324,National Science Foundation measured gravitational waves from the merger of two black holes
325,Along with other groundbased facilities LIGO has since observed dozens more black hole mergers as well as mergers of neutron stars and neutron starblack hole systems
326,So far the black holes detected through gravitational waves have been relatively small with masses of tens to perhaps a hundred times that of our Sun
327,LISA is designed to sense lowfrequency gravitational waves that instruments on Earth cannot detect said Ira Thorpe the NASA study scientist for the mission at the agencys Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt Maryland
328,These sources encompass tens of thousands of small binary systems in our own galaxy as well as massive black holes merging as galaxies collided in the early universe
329,Gravitational waves from a simulated population of compact binary systems in our galaxy were used to construct this synthetic map of the entire sky
330,Such systems contain white dwarfs neutron stars or black holes in tight orbits
331,Maps like this using real data will be possible once the LISA mission becomes active in the next decade
332,The center of our Milky Way galaxy lies at the center of this allsky view with the galactic plane extending across the middle
333,Brighter spots indicate sources with stronger gravitational signals and lighter colors indicate those with higher frequencies
334,NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center LISA will consist of three spacecraft flying in a vast triangular formation that follows Earth in its orbit around the Sun
335,The spacecraft will track internal test masses affected only by gravity
336,At the same time theyll continuously fire lasers to measure their separations to within a span smaller than the size of a helium atom
337,Gravitational waves from sources throughout the universe will produce oscillations in the lengths of the triangles arms and LISA will capture these changes
338,The spacecraft demonstrated the exquisite control and precise laser measurements needed for LISA

340,New Images From Euclid Mission Reveal Wide View of the Dark Universe  MIN READ With NASA contributions the mission will complement dark energy studies to be made by the agencys upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope
341,Dark matter is an invisible substance five times more common in the universe than regular matter but with an unknown composition
342,Dark energy is the name given to the unknown source causing the universe to expand faster and faster
343,Scientists will then chart the presence of dark matter with higher precision than ever before
344,The five new images feature views of varying sizes  from a starforming region in the Milky Way galaxy to clusters of hundreds of galaxies  and were taken shortly after Euclids launch in July  as part of its early release observations program
345,The new images related science papers and data are available at the Euclid website
346,A prerecorded program by ESA about these findings is available on ESA TV and YouTube
347,Mission planners with NASAs forthcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will use Euclids findings to inform Romans complementary dark energy work
348,Scientists will use Roman with its better sensitivity and sharpness to extend the kind of science Euclid enables by studying fainter and more distant galaxies
349,Sometimes the warping is so powerful it can create rings pronounced arcs or multiple images of the same galaxy  a phenomenon called strong gravitational lensing
350,Because dark energy is a relatively weak effect we need larger surveys to give us more data and better statistical precision said Mike Seiffert the NASA project scientist for Euclid at the agencys Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California
351,We need to look at a much bigger area but still be able to detect these subtle effects
352,To make that happen we needed a specialized space telescope like Euclid
353,The telescope uses two instruments that detect different wavelengths of light the visiblelight imager VIS and the nearinfrared spectrometer and photometer NISP
354,Foreground galaxies emit more light in visible wavelengths those the human eye can perceive while background galaxies are typically brighter in infrared wavelengths
355,And Euclid can make these types of deep wide highresolution images hundreds of times faster than other telescopes
356,While dark matter and dark energy are central to the Euclid the mission has a variety of other astronomical applications
357,Euclids largearea sky map can for instance be used to discover faint objects and observe changes in cosmic objects like a star changing in brightness
358,Thought to form like stars but not quite large enough to begin fusion in their cores these objects highlight the differences between stars and planets
359,Its both thrilling and a little overwhelming to keep up with all the developments
360,In addition to designing and fabricating the sensorchip electronics for Euclids Near Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer NISP instrument JPL led the procurement and delivery of the NISP detectors as well
361,Those detectors along with the sensor chip electronics were tested at NASAs Detector Characterization Lab at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt Maryland

371,This book draws from this personal archive and was in development at the time of his death
372,It has been completed in collaboration with his academic colleagues his family and the Stephen Hawking Estate
373,A percentage of the royalties will go to the Motor Neurone Disease Association and the Stephen Hawking Foundation
374,Foreword Eddie Redmayne The first time I met Stephen Hawking I was struck by his extraordinary power and his vulnerability
375,He also insisted that I call him Stephen and stop referring to him as Professor
376,I had been told The opportunity to portray Stephen was an extraordinary one
377,I was drawn to the role because of the duality of Stephens external triumph in his scientific work and the internal battle against motor neurone disease starting in his early twenties
378,His was a unique complex rich story of human endeavour family life huge academic achievement and sheer defiance in the face of all obstacles
379,In my trailer I ended up having three images that I referred to
380,One was Einstein with his tongue out because theres that similar playful wit with Hawking
381,The greatest pressure in playing a living person is that you will have to account for your performance to the person you have portrayed
382,I replied that if it was otherwise perhaps he could just say otherwise and spare me the excoriating details
383,He was moved by it but famously he also stated that he thought there should have been more physics and fewer feelings
384,Since  The Theory of Everything  I have stayed in contact with the Hawking family
385,I was touched to be asked to give a reading at Stephens funeral
386,We have lost a truly beautiful mind an astonishing scientist and the funniest man I have ever had the pleasure to meet
387,But as his family said at the time of Stephens death his work and legacy will live on and so it is with sadness but also great pleasure that I introduce you to this collection of Stephens writings on diverse and fascinating topics
388,I hope you enjoy his writings and to quote Barack Obama I hope Stephen is having fun up there among the stars
389,Thorne I first met Stephen Hawking in July  in London England at a Conference on General Relativity and Gravitation
390,Stephen was in the midst of his PhD studies at the University of Cambridge I had just completed mine at Princeton University
391,Rumours swirled around the conference halls that Stephen had devised a compelling argument that our universe  must  have been born at some finite time in the past
392,So along with some  people I squeezed into a room designed for forty to hear Stephen speak
393,His lucid reasoning relied on Einsteins general relativity equations and on astronomers observations that our universe is expanding and on a few simple assumptions that seemed very likely to be true and it made use of some new mathematical techniques that Roger Penrose had recently devised
394,Combining all these in ways that were clever powerful and compelling Stephen deduced his result our universe must have begun in some sort of singular state roughly ten billion years ago
395,Not just by his argument and conclusion but more importantly by his insightfulness and creativity
396,So I sought him out and spent an hour talking privately with him
397,That was the beginning of a lifelongfriendship a friendship based not just on common science interests but on a remarkable mutual sympathy an uncanny ability to understand each other as human beings
398,Soon we were spending more time talking about our lives our loves and even death than about science though our science was still much of the glue that bound us together
399,In September  I took Stephen and his wife Jane to Moscow Russia
400,Despite the raging Cold War I had been spending a month or so in Moscow every other year since  collaborating on research with members of a group led by Yakov Borisovich Zeldovich
401,Zeldovich was a superb astrophysicist and also a father of the Soviet hydrogen bomb
402,Because of his nuclear secrets he was forbidden to travel to Western Europe or America
403,He craved discussions with Stephen he could not come to Stephen so we went to him
404,In Moscow Stephen wowed Zeldovich and hundreds of other scientists with his insights and in return Stephen learned a thing or two from Zeldovich
405,Most memorable was an afternoon that Stephen and I spent with Zeldovich and his PhD student Alexei Starobinsky in Stephens room in the Rossiya Hotel
406,Zeldovich explained in intuitive ways a remarkable discovery they had made and Starobinsky explained it mathematically
407,A black hole they explained can use its spin energy to create particles and the particles will fly away carrying the spin energy with them
408,We already knew other ways of extracting a black holes spin energy this was just a new though unexpected way
409,Now the great value of conversations like this is that they can trigger new directions of thought
410,He mulled over the ZeldovichStarobinsky discovery for several months looking at it first from one direction and then from another until one day it triggered a truly radical insight in Stephens mind after a black hole stops spinning the hole can still emit particles
411,It can radiateand it radiates as though the black hole was hot like the Sun though not very hot just mildly warm
412,A hole that weighs as much as the Sun has a temperature of
413,This Hawking temperature of a black hole and its Hawking radiation as they came to be called were truly radicalperhaps the most radical theoretical physics discovery in the second half of the twentieth century
414,He deduced that the amount of entropy the logarithm of the holes amount of randomness is proportional to the holes surface area
415,For the past fortyfive years Stephen and hundreds of other physicists have struggled to understand the precise nature of a black holes randomness
416,It is a question that keeps on generating new insights about the marriage of quantum theory with general relativitythat is about the illunderstood laws of quantum gravity
417,In autumn  Stephen brought his PhD students and his family his wife Jane and their two children Robert and Lucy to Pasadena California for a year so that he and his students could participate in the intellectual life of my university Caltech and merge temporarily with my own research group
418,During that year Stephen and his students and some of mine struggled to understand black holes more deeply as did I to some degree
419,But Stephens presence and his leadership in our joint groups black hole research gave me freedom to pursue a new direction that I had been contemplating for some years gravitational waves
420,Electromagnetic waves consist of oscillating electric and magnetic forces that travel at light speed
421,That information can then be amplified and fed into a loudspeaker or on to a TV screen for humans to comprehend
422,Gravitational waves according to Einstein consist of an oscillatory space warp an oscillating stretch and squeeze of space
423,Rai proposed using laser beams to measure the oscillating pattern of this stretch and squeeze
424,The laser light could extract a gravitational waves information and the signal could then be amplified and fed into a computer for human comprehension
425,During the  years since then electromagnetic astronomy has completely revolutionised our understanding of the universe
426,Gravitational waves we concluded are the ideal tool for exploring and testing Stephens insights about black holes
427,More generally it seemed to us gravitational waves are so radically different from electromagnetic waves that they were almost guaranteed to create their own new revolution in our understanding of the universe perhaps comparable to the enormous electromagnetic revolution that followed Galileo if  these elusive waves could be detected and monitored
428,So during that glorious year with Stephens and my research groups merged at Caltech I spent much of my time exploring the prospects for gravitationalwave success
429,Shortly after Stephens return to Cambridge my exploration reached fruition with an allnight intense discussion between Rai Weiss and me in Rais hotel room in Washington DC
430,I became convinced that the prospects for success were great enough that I should devote most of my own career and my future students research to helping Rai and other experimenters achieve our gravitationalwave vision
431,On September   the LIGO gravitationalwave detectors built by a person project that Rai and I and Ronald Drever cofounded and Barry Barish organised assembled and led registered their first gravitational waves
432,During our glorious year of  while I was dithering over gravitational waves and Stephen was leading our merged group in black hole research Stephen himself had an insight even more radical than hisdiscovery of Hawking radiation
433,This is radical because the laws of quantum physics insist unequivocally that information can never get totally lost
434,So if Stephen was right black holes violate a most fundamental quantum mechanical law
435,The great majority of theoretical physicists find this conclusion abhorrent
436,And so for fortyfour years they have struggled with this socalled informationloss paradox
437,It is a struggle well worth the effort and anguish that have gone into it since this paradox is a powerful key for understanding the quantum gravity laws
438,Stephen himself in  found a way that information might escape during the holes evaporation but that did not quell theorists struggles
439,Stephen did not  prove  that the information escapes so the struggle continues
440,In my eulogy for Stephen at the interment of his ashes at Westminster Abbey I memorialised that struggle with these words Newton gave us answers
441,And Hawkings questions themselves keep on giving generating breakthroughs decades later
442,I dont have enough skills wisdom or selfconfidence to tackle them
443,Stephen by contrast was always attracted to big questions whether they were deeply rooted in his science or not
444,He  did  have the necessary skills wisdom and self confidence
445,Stephens answers to six of the questions are deeply rooted in his science
446,Here you will find him discussing in depth the issues that Ive described briefly in this Introduction and also much much more
447,His answers to the other four big questions cannot possibly be rooted solidly in his science
448,Will we survive on Earth Is there other intelligent life in the universe Should we colonise space Will artificial intelligence outsmart us Nevertheless his answers display deep wisdom and creativity as we should expect
449,I hope you find his answers as stimulating and insightful as do I
450,But real science can be far stranger than science fiction and much more satisfying
451,And a scientist with a deep fascination with physics cosmology the universe and the future of humanity
452,I was brought up by my parents to have an unwavering curiosity and like my father to research and try to answer the many questions that science asks us
453,I have spent my life travelling across the universe inside my mind
454,Through theoretical physics I have sought to answer some of the great questions
455,At one point I thought I would see the end of physics as we know it but now I think the wonder of discovery will continue long after I am gone
456,We are close to some of these answers but we are not there yet
457,The problem is most people believe that real science is too difficult and complicated for them to understand
458,To do research on the fundamental laws that govern the universe would require a commitment of time that most people dont have the world would soon grind to a halt if we all tried to do theoretical physics
459,It has been a glorious time to be alive and doing research in theoreticalphysics
460,Our picture of the universe has changed a great deal in the last fifty years and Im happy if I have made a contribution
461,One of the great revelations of the space age has been the perspective it has given humanity on ourselves
462,It is such a simple image with a compelling message one planet one human race
463,Let them rise to the challenge of the sustainable development goals and act not out of selfinterest but out of common interest
464,I have written about my life before but some of my early experiences are worth repeating as I think about my lifelong fascination with the big questions
465,In fact a V rocket landed a few houses away from ours
466,I was away with my mother and sister at the time and fortunately my father was not hurt
467,In  my fathers place of work moved to the northern edge of London to the newly constructed National Institute for Medical Research in Mill Hill so my family relocated to the cathedral city of St Albansnearby
468,I was never more than about halfway up the classit was a very bright class but my classmates gave me the nickname Einstein so presumably they saw signs of something better
469,I had six or seven close friends in St Albans and I remember having long discussions and arguments about everything from radiocontrolled models to religion
470,One of the big questions we discussed was the origin of the universe and whether it required a God to create it and set it going
471,I had heard that light from distant galaxies was shifted towards the red end of the spectrum and this was supposed to indicate that the universe was expanding
472,But I was sure there must be some other reason for the red shift
473,Maybe light got tired and more red on its way to us An essentially unchanging and everlasting universe seemed so much more natural
474,It was only years later after the discovery of the cosmic microwave background about two years into my PhD research that I realised I had been wrong
475,My practical abilities never matched up to my theoretical qualities
476,My father encouraged my interest in science and was very keen that I should go to Oxford or Cambridge
477,He himself had gone to University College Oxford so he thought I should apply there
478,At that time University College had no fellow in mathematics so I had little option but to try for a scholarship in natural science
479,The prevailing attitude at Oxford at that time was very antiwork
480,You were supposed to be brilliant without effort or to accept your limitations and get a fourthclass degree
481,I took this as an invitation to do very little
482,Im not proud of this Im just describing my attitude at the time shared by most of my fellow students
483,One result of my illness has been to change all that
484,Because of my lack of work I had planned to get through the finalexam by avoiding questions that required any factual knowledge and focus instead on problems in theoretical physics
485,But I didnt sleep the night before the exam and so I didnt do very well
486,In the interview they asked me about my future plans
487,If they gave me a first I would go to Cambridge
488,If I only got a second I would stay in Oxford
489,In the long vacation following my final exam the college offered a number of small travel grants
490,I thought my chances of getting one would be greater the further I proposed to go so I said I wanted to go to Iran
491,In the summer of  I set out taking a train to Istanbul then on to Erzuerum in eastern Turkey then to Tabriz Tehran Isfahan Shiraz and Persepolis the capital of the ancient Persian kings
492,On my way home I and my travelling companion Richard Chiin were caught in the Bouin Zahra earthquake a massive
493,I must have been near the epicentre but I was unaware of it because I was ill and in a bus that was bouncing around on the Iranian roads that were then very uneven
494,Despite the earthquake I have many fond memories of my time in Iran
495,Intense curiosity about the world can put one in harms way but for me this was probably the only time in my life that this was true
496,I had applied to work with Fred Hoyle the most famous British astronomer of the time
497,I say astronomer because cosmology then was hardly recognised as a legitimate field
498,I began my work by reading old textbooks on general relativityas ever drawn to the biggest questions
499,The winter after I arrived in Cambridge was very cold
500,I fell over and had great difficulty getting up again
501,My mother realised something was wrong and took me to the doctor
502,I spent weeks in St Bartholomews Hospital in London and had many tests
503,I also learned that people with this disease gradually lose the ability to control their movements to speak to eat and eventually to breathe
504,Understandably I became depressed and couldnt see the point of continuing to research my PhD because I didnt know if I would live long enough to finish it
505,But then the progression slowed down and I had a renewed enthusiasm for my work
506,After my expectations had been reduced to zero every new day became abonus and I began to appreciate everything I did have
507,She was very determined that together we could fight my condition
508,Getting engaged lifted my spirits and I realised if we were going to get married I had to get a job and finish my PhD
509,To support myself during my studies I applied for a research fellowship at Gonvillle and Cauis College
510,To my great surprise I was elected and have been a fellow of Caius ever since
511,It meant that I could continue my research despite my increasing disability
512,Our first child Robert was born after we had been married about two years
513,Our second child Lucy was born about three years later
514,As a father I would try to instill the importance of asking questions always
515,He wanted to know if there were lots of tiny universes dotted around
516,Surely I thought we already knew that nothing could prevent a massive cold star from collapsing under its own gravity until it reached a singularity of infinite density
517,I realised that similar arguments could be applied to the expansion of the universe
518,A eureka moment came in  a few days after the birth of my daughter Lucy
519,Moreover if two black holes collide and merge to form a single black hole the area of the event horizon around the resulting black hole is greater than the sum of the areas of the event horizons around the original black holes
520,In fact we were so successful with the classical general theory of relativity that I was at a bit of a loose end in  after the publication with George Ellis of our book  The Large Scale Structure of SpaceTime
521,I was expecting that part of an incident wave would beabsorbed and the remainder scattered
522,But to my great surprise I found there seemed to be emission from the black hole itself
523,At first I thought this must be a mistake in my calculation
524,The emission of this thermal radiation from the black hole is now called Hawking radiation and Im proud to have discovered it
525,In  I was elected a fellow of the Royal Society
526,This election came as a surprise to members of my department because I was young and only a lowly research assistant
527,But within three years I had been promoted to professor
528,My work on black holes had given me hope that we would discover a theory of everything and that quest for an answer drove me on
529,In the same year my friend Kip Thorne invited me and my young family and a number of others working in general relativity to the California Institute of Technology Caltech
530,It gave me a considerable degree of independence especially as in the United States buildings and sidewalks are much more accessible for the disabled than they are in Britain
531,Everything seemed so parochial and restricted in Britain compared to the cando attitude in America
532,At the time the landscape was littered with dead trees killed by Dutch elm disease and the country was beset bystrikes
533,I also spent time working with Jim Hartle formulating a theory of the universes birth that we called no boundary
534,By the early s my health continued to worsen and I endured prolonged choking fits because my larynx was weakening and was letting food into my lungs as I ate
535,In  I caught pneumonia on a trip to CERN the European Organisation for Nuclear Research in Switzerland
536,I was rushed to the Lucerne Cantonal Hospital and put on to a ventilator
537,But Jane refused and had me flown back to Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge by air ambulance
538,As most of you will know a tracheostomy takes away the ability to speak
539,If it is slurred as mine was people can think you are mentally deficient and treat you accordingly
540,Luckily a computer expert in California named Walt Woltosz heard of my difficulties
541,He sent me a computer program he had written called Equalizer
542,I can claim to be the most connected person in the world
543,I first had the idea of writing a popular book about the universe in  around the time of my noboundary work
544,Appropriately enough  A Brief History of Time  was first published on April Fools Day in
545,Indeed the book was originally meant to be called  From the Big Bang to Black Holes A Short History of Time
546,The title was shortened and changed to brief and the rest is history
547,I never expected  A Brief History of Time  to do as well as it has
548,Not everyone may have finished it or understood everything they read but they at least grappled with one of the big questions of our existence and got the idea that we live in a universe governed by rational laws that through science we can discover and understand
549,To my colleagues Im just another physicist but to the wider public I became possibly the bestknown scientist in the world
550,This is partly because scientists apart from Einstein are not widely known rock stars and partly because I fit the stereotype of a disabled genius
551,I cant disguise myself with a wig and dark glassesthe wheelchair gives me away
552,Being well known and easily recognisable has its pluses and minuses but the minuses are more than outweighed by the pluses
553,I have led an extraordinary life on this planet while at the same time travelling across the universe by using my mind and the laws of physics
554,I have been to the furthest reaches of our galaxy travelled into a black hole and gone back to the beginning of time
555,On Earth I have experienced highs and lows turbulence and peace success and suffering
556,I have been rich and poor I have been ablebodied and disabled
557,I have been enormously privileged through my work in being able to contribute to our understanding of the universe
558,Without them the wonder of it all would be lost on me
559,I want to share my excitement about these big questions and my enthusiasm about this quest
560,One day I hope we will know the answers to all these questions
561,Let us fight for every woman and every man to have the opportunity to live healthy secure lives full of opportunity and love
562,We are all time travellers journeying together into the future
563,But let us work together to make that future a place we want to visit
564,My work was untidy and my handwriting not very good
565,And we talked about everything and specifically the origin of the universe
566,IS THERE A GODS cience is increasingly answering questions that used to be the province of religion
567,The world was a scary place so even people as tough as the Vikings believed in supernatural beings to make sense of natural phenomena like lightning storms or eclipses
568,Nowadays science provides better and more consistent answers but people will always cling to religion because it gives comfort and they do not trust or understand science
569,I do not want to give the impression that my work is about proving or disproving the existence of God
570,My work is about finding a rational framework to understand the universe around us
571,For centuries it was believed that disabled people like me were living under a curse that was inflicted by God
572,Well I suppose its possible that Ive upset someone up there but I prefer to think that everything can be explained another way by the laws of nature
573,If you believe in science like I do you believe that there are certain laws that are always obeyed
574,If you like you can say the laws are the work of God but that is more a definition of God than a proof of his existence
575,In about   BCE  a philosopher called Aristarchus was fascinated by eclipses especiallyeclipses of the Moon
576,He was brave enough to question whether they really were caused by gods
577,He studied the heavens carefully and reached a bold conclusion he realised the eclipse was really the shadow of the Earth passing over the Moon and not a divine event
578,He deduced that the Earth was not the centre of the universe as everyone had thought but that it instead orbits the Sun
579,He suggested that stars were not chinks in the floor of heaven as his contemporaries believed but that stars were other suns like ours only a very long way away
580,The universe is a machine governed by principles or lawslaws that can be understood by the human mind
581,I believe that the discovery of these laws has been humankinds greatest achievement for its these laws of natureas we now call them that will tell us whether we need a god to explain the universe at all
582,And there are many other laws at work here too
583,They apply not just to the flight of a ball but to the motion of a planet and everything else in the universe
584,One could define God as the embodiment of the laws of nature
585,I use the word God in an impersonal sense like Einstein did for the laws of nature so knowing the mind of God is knowing the laws of nature
586,My prediction is that we will know the mind of God by the end of this century
587,I published a book that asked if God created the universe and that caused something of a stir
588,People got upset that a scientist should have anything to say on the matter of religion
589,I think the universe was spontaneously created out of nothing according to the laws of science
590,The laws of science determine the evolution of the universe given its state at one time
591,These laws may or may not have been decreed by God but he cannot intervene to break the laws or they would not be laws
592,That leaves God with the freedom to choose the initial state of the universe but even here it seems there may be laws
593,Despite the complexity and variety of the universe it turns out that to make one you need just three ingredients
594,Lets imagine that we could list them in some kind of cosmic cookbook
595,Matter is all around us in the ground beneath our feet and out in space
596,Vast clouds of gas massive spirals of stars each containing billions of suns stretching away for incredible distances
597,Look up at the Sun and you can feel it on your face energy produced by a star ninetythree million miles away
598,Energy permeates the universe driving the processes that keep it a dynamic endlessly changing place
599,The third thing we need to build a universe is space
600,You can call the universe many thingsawesome beautiful violentbut one thing you cant call it is cramped
601,Einstein realised something quite extraordinary that two of the main ingredients needed to make a universemass and energyare basically the same thing two sides of the same coin if you like
602,His famous equation E  mc   simply means that mass can be thought of as a kind of energy and vice versa
603,So instead of three ingredients we can now say that the universe has just two energy and space
604,At the moment of the Big Bang an entire universe came into existence and with it space
605,It all inflated just like a balloon being blown up
606,At the risk of getting myself into trouble I think we can understand much more the natural phenomena that terrified the Vikings
607,We can even go beyond the beautiful symmetry of energy and matter discovered by Einstein
608,We can use the laws of nature to address the very origins of the universe and discover if the existence of God is the only way to explain it
609,As I was growing up in England after the Second World War it was a time of austerity
610,We were told that you never get something for nothing
611,The secret lies in one of the strangest facts about our cosmos
612,The laws of physics demand the existence of something called negative energy
613,To help you get your head around this weird but crucial concept let me draw on a simple analogy
614,Imagine a man wants to build a hill on a flat piece of land
615,To make this hill he digs a hole in the ground and uses that soil to dig his hill
616,But of course hes not just making a hillhes also making a hole in effect a negative version of the hill
617,The stuff that was in the hole has now become the hill so it all perfectly balances out
618,In this way the positive and the negative add up to zero always
619,This may sound odd but according to the laws of nature concerning gravity and motionlaws that are among the oldest in sciencespace itself is a vast store of negative energy
620,Ill admit that unless mathematics is your thing this is hard to grasp but its true
621,The endless web of billions upon billions of galaxies each pulling on each other by the force of gravity acts like a giant storage device
622,The universe is like an enormous battery storing negative energy
623,The positive side of thingsthe mass and energy we see todayis like the hill
624,The corresponding hole or negative side of things is spread throughout space
625,You have to make it out of other stuff like coffee beans water and perhaps some milk and sugar
626,Thats because at this scale particles such as protons behave according to the laws of nature we call quantum mechanics
627,Since we know the universe itself was once very smallperhaps smaller than a protonthis means something quite remarkable
628,It means the universe itself in all its mindboggling vastness and complexity could simply have popped into existence without violating the known laws of nature
629,From that moment on vast amounts of energy were released as space itself expandeda place to store all the negative energy needed to balance the books
630,But of course the critical question is raised again did God create the quantum laws that allowed the Big Bang to occur In a nutshell do we need a God to set it up so that the Big Bang could bang I have no desire to offend anyone of faith but I think science has a more compelling explanation than a divine creator
631,Our everyday experience makes us think that everything that happens must be caused by something that occurred earlier in time so its natural for us to think that somethingmaybe Godmust have caused the universe to come into existence
632,The laws of nature itself tell us that not only could the universe have popped into existence without any assistance like a proton and have required nothing in terms of energy but also that it is possible thatnothing caused the Big Bang
633,Something very wonderful happened to time at the instant of the Big Bang
634,To understand this mindboggling idea consider a black hole floating in space
635,A typical black hole is a star so massive that it has collapsed in on itself
636,Its gravitational pull is so powerful it warps and distorts not only light but also time
637,As the clock gets closer and closer to the black hole it begins to get slower and slower
638,Now imagine the clock as it enters the black holewell assuming of course that it could withstand the extreme gravitational forcesit would actually stop
639,It stops not because it is broken but because inside the black hole time itself doesnt exist
640,In the last hundred years we have made spectacular advances in our understanding of the universe
641,And just as with modernday black holes floating around in space the laws of nature dictate something quite extraordinary
642,They tell us that here too time itself must come to a stop
643,You cant get to a time before the Big Bang because there was no time before the Big Bang
644,We have finally found something that doesnt have a cause because there was no time for a cause to exist in
645,For me this means that there is no possibility of a creator because there is no time for a creator to have existed in
646,They dont expect the answers to be easy so they are prepared to struggle a bit
647,Time didnt exist before the Big Bang so there is no time for God to make the universe in
648,Its like asking for directions to the edge of the Earththe Earth is a sphere that doesnt have an edge so looking for it is a futile exercise
649,No one created the universe and no one directs our fate
650,This leads me to a profound realisation there is probably no heaven and afterlife either
651,I think belief in an afterlife is just wishful thinking
652,There is no reliable evidence for it and it flies in the face of everything we know in science
653,We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe and for that I am extremely grateful
654,If you like you can call the laws of science God but it wouldnt be a personal God that you would meet and put questions to
655,Prometheus punishment was being chained to a rock for eternity although happily he was eventually liberated by Hercules
656,We have already made remarkable progress in understanding the cosmos
657,I like to think we may not be far off
658,According to the Boshongo people of central Africa in the beginning there was only darkness water and the great god Bumba
659,One day Bumba in pain from stomach ache vomited up the Sun
660,The Sun dried up some of the water leaving land
661,Still in pain Bumba vomited up the Moon the stars and then some animalsthe leopard the crocodile the turtle and finally man
662,These creation myths like many others try to answer the questions we all ask
663,So it cant have been around that long or it would have progressed even more
664,For example according to Bishop Ussher the Book of Genesis placed the beginning of time on October    BCE  at  p
665,On the other hand the physical surroundings like mountains and rivers change very little in a human lifetime
666,They were therefore thought to be a constant background and either to have existed for ever as an empty landscape or to have been created at the same time as the humans
667,For example Aristotle the most famous of the Greek philosophers believed that the universe had existed for ever
668,He suggested the reason we see progress was that floods or other natural disasters had repeatedly set civilisation back to the beginning
669,The motivation for believing in an eternal universe was the desire to avoid invoking divine intervention to create the universe and set it going
670,He felt there were logical contradictions or antimonies either way
671,Both the thesis and the antithesis depended on Kants assumption along with almost everyone else that time was absolute
672,That is to say it went from the infinite past to the infinite future independently of any universe that might or might not exist
673,This is still the picture in the mind of many scientists today
674,In this space and time were no longer absolute no longer a fixed background to events
675,Instead they were dynamical quantities that were shaped by the matter and energy in the universe
676,They were defined onlywithin the universe so it made no sense to talk of a time before the universe began
677,It would be like asking for a point south of the South Pole
678,Although Einsteins theory unified time and space it didnt tell us much about space itself
679,Something that seems obvious about space is that it goes on and on and on
680,But modern instruments like the Hubble space telescope allow us to probe deep into space
681,There are giant elliptical galaxies and spiral galaxies like our own
682,Our own galaxy blocks our view in certain directions but apart from that the galaxies are distributed roughly uniformly throughout space with some local concentrations and voids
683,The density of galaxies appears to drop off at very large distances but that seems to be because they are so far away and faint that we cant make them out
684,Although the universe seems to be much the same at each position in space it is definitely changing in time
685,This was not realised until the early years of the last century
686,Up to then it was thought the universe was essentially constant in time
687,It might have existed for an infinite time but that seemed to lead to absurd conclusions
688,If stars had been radiating for an infinite time they would have heated up the universe until it reached their own temperature
689,So the observation that we have all made that the sky at night is dark is very important
690,It implies that the universe cannot have existed for ever in the state we see today
691,Something must have happened in the past to make the stars turn on a finite time ago
692,Then the light from very distant stars wouldnt have had time to reach us yet
693,But for most people it wasconsistent with the idea that the universe had been created much as it is now only a few thousand years ago just as Bishop Ussher had concluded
694,First of all Edwin Hubble discovered that many faint patches of light called nebulae were in fact other galaxies vast collections of stars like our Sun but at a great distance
695,In order for them to appear so small and faint the distances had to be so great that light from them would have taken millions or even billions of years to reach us
696,This indicated that the beginning of the universe couldnt have been just a few thousand years ago
697,But the second thing Hubble discovered was even more remarkable
698,By an analysis of the light from other galaxies Hubble was able to measure whether they were moving towards us or away
699,To his great surprise he found they were nearly all moving away
700,Moreover the further they were from us the faster they were moving away
701,The discovery of the expansion of the universe was one of the great intellectual revolutions of the twentieth century
702,It came as a total surprise and it completely changed the discussion of the origin of the universe
703,If the galaxies are moving apart they must have been closer together in the past
704,From the present rate of expansion we can estimate that they must have been very close together indeed about  to  billion years ago
705,So it looks as though the universe might have started then with everything being at the same point in space
706,But many scientists were unhappy with the universe having a beginning because it seemed to imply that physics broke down
707,One of these was the steadystate theory proposed by Hermann Bondi Thomas Gold and Fred Hoyle in
708,In the steadystate theory as galaxies moved apart the idea was that new galaxies would form from matter that was supposed to be continually being created throughout space
709,The universe would have existed for ever and would have looked the same at all times
710,This last property hadthe great virtue of being a definite prediction that could be tested by observation
711,The Cambridge radio astronomy group under Martin Ryle did a survey of weak sources of radio waves in the early s
712,These were distributed fairly uniformly across the sky indicating that most of the sources lay outside our galaxy
713,The steadystate theory predicted a relationship between the number of sources and their strength
714,This was contrary to the basic assumption of the steadystate theory that everything was constant in time
715,For this and other reasons the steadystate theory was abandoned
716,Another attempt to avoid the universe having a beginning was the suggestion that there was a previous contracting phase but because of rotation and local irregularities the matter would not all fall to the same point
717,Instead different parts of the matter would miss each other and the universe would expand again with the density always remaining finite
718,Two Russians Evgeny Lifshitz and Isaak Khalatnikov actually claimed to have proved that a general contraction without exact symmetry would always lead to a bounce with the density remaining finite
719,This result was very convenient for MarxistLeninist dialectical materialism because it avoided awkward questions about the creation of the universe
720,It therefore became an article of faith for Soviet scientists
721,I began my research in cosmology just about the time that Lifshitz and Khalatnikov published their conclusion that the universe didnt have a beginning
722,I realised that this was a very important question but I wasnt convinced by the arguments that Lifshitz and Khalatnikov had used
723,There is a chain of causality stretching back into the past
724,But suppose this chain has a beginning suppose there was a first event
725,They tried to avoid it either by claiming like the Russians and the steadystate theorists that the universe didnt have a beginning or by maintaining that the origin of the universe did not lie within the realm of science but belonged to metaphysics or religion
726,In my opinion this is not a position any true scientist shouldtake
727,If the laws of science are suspended at the beginning of the universe might not they also fail at other times A law is not a law if it only holds sometimes
728,I believe that we should try to understand the beginning of the universe on the basis of science
729,It may be a task beyond our powers but at least we should make the attempt
730,It is difficult to argue with a mathematical theorem so in the end Lifshitz and Khalatnikov conceded that the universe should have a beginning
731,Although the idea of a beginning to the universe might not be very welcome to communist ideas ideology was never allowed to stand in the way of science in physics
732,Physics was needed for the bomb and it was important that it worked
733,At this point Einsteins general theory of relativity would have broken down
734,One is left with the origin of the universe apparently being beyond the scope of science
735,Observational evidence to confirm the idea that the universe had a very dense beginning came in October  a few months after my first singularity result with the discovery of a faint background of microwaves throughout space
736,These microwaves are the same as those in your microwave oven but very much less powerful
737,degrees Fahrenheit not much good for defrosting the pizza let alone cooking it
738,If you ever set your television to an empty channel a few per cent of the snow you saw on the screen was caused by this background of microwaves
739,The only reasonable interpretation of the background is that it is radiation left over from an early very hot and dense state
740,As theuniverse expanded the radiation would have cooled until it is just the faint remnant we observe today
741,That the universe began with a singularity was not an idea that I or a number of other people were happy with
742,It can be summed up in the Uncertainty Principle that was proposed in  by the German scientist Werner Heisenberg
743,One cannot accurately predict both the position and the speed of a particle
744,The more accurately the position is predicted the less accurately you will be able to predict the speed and vice versa
745,Einstein objected strongly to the idea that the universe is governed by chance
746,His feelings were summed up in his dictum God does not play dice
747,But all the evidence is that God is quite a gambler
748,The universe is like a giant casino with dice being rolled or wheels being spun on every occasion
749,A casino owner risks losing money each time dice are thrown or the roulette wheel is spun
750,But over a large number of bets the odds average out and the casino owner makes sure they average out in his or her favour
751,The only chance you have of winning against them is to stake all your money on a few rolls of the dice or spins of the wheel
752,In order to understand the origin of the universe one therefore has to incorporate the Uncertainty Principle into Einsteins general theory of relativity
753,This has been the great challenge in theoretical physics for at least the last thirty years
754,Wehavent solved it yet but we have made a lot of progress
755,Because we only know some combination of position and speed of a particle we cannot make precise predictions about the future positions and speeds of particles
756,We can only assign a probability to particular combinations of positions and speeds
757,Thus there is a certain probability to a particular future of the universe
758,But now suppose we try to understand the past in the same way
759,Given the nature of the observations we can make now all we can do is assign a probability to a particular history of the universe
760,Thus the universe must have many possible histories each with its own probability
761,This idea that the universe has multiple histories may sound like science fiction but it is now accepted as science fact
762,So we presume it works to retrodict the past too
763,Scientists are now working to combine Einsteins general theory of relativity and Feynmans idea of multiple histories into a complete unified theory that will describe everything that happens in the universe
764,But if the frontier of the universe was just at a normal point of space and time we could go past it and claim the territory beyond as part of the universe
765,It seems there is no logical basis for picking one set of boundary conditions over another
766,Maybe the universe has no boundary in space and time
767,At first sight this seems to be in direct contradiction to the geometrical theorems that I mentioned earlier
768,It isnt anything to do with the real time that we experience
769,It is a mathematical trick to make the calculations work and it replaces the real time we experience
770,Our idea was to say that there was no boundary in imaginary time
771,If the boundary condition of the universe is that it has no boundary in imaginary time it wont have just a single history
772,There are many histories in imaginary time and each of them will determine a history in real time
773,Thus we have a superabundance of histories for the universe
774,It may be that intelligent beings can evolve without galaxies and stars but it seems unlikely
775,It implies it is one of the minority of histories that have galaxies and stars
776,The Anthropic Principle says that the universe has to be more or less as we see it because if it were different there wouldnt be anyone here to observe it
777,Many scientists dislike the Anthropic Principle because it seems little more than hand waving and not to have much predictive power
778,Most of these histories are quite unsuitable for the development of intelligent life
779,Either they are empty or too short lasting or too highly curved or wrong in some otherway
780,Yet according to Richard Feynmans multiplehistories idea these uninhabited histories might have quite a high probability
781,The human race does not have a very good record of intelligent behaviour
782,As an example of the power of the Anthropic Principle consider the number of directions in space
783,It is a matter of common experience that we live in threedimensional space
784,That is to say we can represent the position of a point in space by three numbers
785,If it had a gut that went right through like we have it would divide the animal in two and the poor creature would fall apart
786,So two flat directions are not enough for anything as complicated as intelligent life
787,In three dimensions planets can have stable orbits around stars
788,This is a consequence of gravitation obeying the inverse square law as discovered by Robert Hooke in  and elaborated on by Isaac Newton
789,Think about the gravitational attraction of two bodies at a particular distance
790,If that distance is doubled then the force between them is divided by four
791,If the distance is tripled then the force is divided by nine if quadrupled then the force is divided by sixteen and so on
792,If the distance between two bodies is doubled then the gravitational force would be divided by eight tripled by twentyseven and if quadrupled by sixtyfour
793,This change to an inverse cube law prevents planets from having stable orbits around their suns
794,They would either fall into their sun or escape to the outer darkness and cold
795,Similarly the orbits of electrons in atoms would not be stable so matter as we know it would not exist
796,Thus although the multiple histories idea would allow any number of nearly flat directions only histories with three flat directions will contain intelligent beings
797,The differences between different directions is about one part in
798,The generally accepted explanation for this smoothness is that very early in the history of the universe it underwent a period of very rapid expansion by a factor of at least a billion billion billion
799,This process is known as inflation something that was good for the universe in contrast to inflation of prices that too often plagues us
800,If that was all there was to it the microwave radiation would be totally the same in all directions
801,Quantum fluctuations occur as a consequence of the Uncertainty Principle
802,Furthermore these fluctuations were the seeds for structures in our universe galaxies stars and us
803,We held a workshop in Cambridge that summer attended by all the major players in the field
804,This was ten years before fluctuations in the microwave sky were discovered by the COBE satellite in  so theory was way ahead of experiment
805,Cosmology became a precision science another ten years later in  with the first results from the WMAP satellite
806,WMAP produced a wonderful map of the temperature of the cosmic microwave sky a snapshot of the universe at about onehundredth of its present age
807,The irregularities you see are predicted by inflation and they mean that some regions of the universe had a slightly higher density than others
808,The gravitational attraction of the extra density slows the expansion of that region and can eventually cause it to collapse to form galaxies and stars
809,So look carefully at the map of the microwave sky
810,It is the blueprint for all the structure in the universe
811,We are the product of quantum fluctuations in the very early universe
812,Superseding WMAP today there is the Planck satellite with a much higherresolution map of the universe
813,Planck is testing our theories in earnest and may even detect the imprint of gravitational waves predicted by inflation
814,Mtheory predicts that a great many universes were created out of nothing corresponding to the many different possible histories
815,Each universe has many possible histories and many possible states as they age to the present and beyond into the future
816,Most of these states will be quite unlike the universe we observe
817,There is still hope that we see the first evidence for Mtheory at the LHC particle accelerator the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Geneva
818,From an Mtheory perspective it only probes low energies but we might be lucky and see a weaker signal of fundamental theory such as supersymmetry
819,I think the discovery of supersymmetric partners for the known particles would revolutionise our understanding of the universe
820,In  the discovery of the Higgs particle by the LHC at CERN in Geneva was announced
821,This was the first discovery of a new elementary particle in the twentyfirst century
822,There is still some hope that the LHC will discover supersymmetry
823,But even if the LHC does not discover any new elementary particles supersymmetry might still be found in the next generation of accelerators that are presently being planned
824,The beginning of the universe itself in the Hot Big Bang is the ultimatehighenergy laboratory for testing Mtheory and our ideas about the building blocks of spacetime and matter
825,Different theories leave behind different fingerprints in the current structure of the universe so astrophysical data can give us clues about the unification of all the forces of nature
826,So there may well be other universes but unfortunately we will never be able to explore them
827,We have seen something about the origin of the universe
828,They depend on the amount of matter in the universe
829,If there is more than a certain critical amount the gravitational attraction between the galaxies will slow down the expansion
830,Eventually they will then start falling towards each other and will all come together in a Big Crunch
831,That will be the end of the history of the universe in real time
832,In Britain people dont seem too worried about a possible end twenty billion years in the future
833,You can do quite a lot of eating drinking and being merry before that
834,If the density of the universe is below the critical value gravity is too weak to stop the galaxies flying apart for ever
835,All the stars will burn out and the universe will get emptier and emptier and colder and colder
836,So again things will come to an end but in a less dramatic way
837,In this answer I have tried to explain something of the origins future and nature of our universe
838,Yet this nut encodes everything that happens in real time
839,We could be bounded in a nutshell and count ourselves kings of infinite space
840,IS THERE OTHER INTELLIGENT LIFE IN THE UNIVERSEI  would like to speculate a little on the development of life in the universe and in particular on the development of intelligent life
841,I shall take this to include the human race even though much of its behaviour throughout history has been pretty stupid and not calculated to aid the survival of the species
842,This observation even has its own law the so called second law of thermodynamics
843,This law says that the total amount of disorder or entropy in the universe always increases with time
844,The order in one body can increase provided that the amount of  dis order in its surroundings increases by a greater amount
845,We can define life as an ordered system that can keep itself going against the tendency to disorder and can reproduce itself
846,That is it can make similar but independent ordered systems
847,To do these things the system must convert energy in some ordered formlike food sunlight or electric powerinto disordered energy in the form of heat
848,In this way the system can satisfy the requirement that the total amount of disorder increases while at the same time increasing the order in itself and its offspring
849,In biology these two parts are called genes and metabolism
850,But it is worth emphasising that there need be nothing biological about them
851,For example a computer virus is a program that will make copies of itself in the memory of a computer and will transfer itself to other computers
852,Thus it fits the definition of a living system that I have given
853,Like a biological virus it is a rather degenerate form because it contains only instructions or genes and doesnt have any metabolism of its own
854,Instead it reprograms the metabolism of the host computer or cell
855,Some people have questioned whether viruses should count as life because they are parasites and cannot exist independently of their hosts
856,But then most forms of life ourselves included are parasites in that they feed off and depend for their survival on other forms of life
857,Maybe it says something about human nature that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive
858,I shall return to electronic forms of life later on
859,One can speculate that one might have life with some other chemical basis such as silicon but carbon seems the most favourable case because it has the richest chemistry
860,That carbon atoms should exist at all with the properties that they have requires a fine adjustment of physical constants such as the QCD scale the electric charge and even the dimension of spacetime
861,If these constants had significantly different values either the nucleus of the carbon atom would not be stable or the electrons would collapse in on the nucleus
862,At first sight it seems remarkable that the universe is so finely tuned
863,Maybe this is evidence that the universe was specially designed to produce the human race
864,One can apply the Anthropic Principle in either its Strong or Weak versions
865,For the Strong Anthropic Principle one supposes that there are many different universes each with differentvalues of the physical constants
866,Since we must live in one of these universes we should not be surprised that the physical constants are finely tuned
867,That is I shall take the values of the physical constants as given
868,It was so hot that all the matter would have been in the form of particles called protons and neutrons
869,There would initially have been equal numbers of protons and neutrons
870,About a minute after the Big Bang the temperature would have fallen to about a billion degrees about a hundred times the temperature in the Sun
871,At this temperature neutrons start to decay into more protons
872,But no heavier elements like carbon or oxygen would have been formed in the early universe
873,It is difficult to imagine that one could build a living system out of just hydrogen and heliumand anyway the early universe was still far too hot for atoms to combine into molecules
874,But some regions had slightly higher densities than others and the gravitational attraction of the extra matter in those regions slowed down their expansion and eventually stopped it
875,Instead they collapsed to form galaxies and stars starting from about two billion years after the Big Bang
876,Some of the early stars would have been more massive than our Sun they would have been hotter than the Sun and would have burned the original hydrogen and helium into heavier elements such as carbon oxygen and iron
877,After that some of the stars exploded as supernovae and scattered the heavy elements back into space to form the raw material for later generations of stars
878,Other stars are too far away for us to be able to see directly if they have planets going round them
879,The first is to look at the star and see if the amount of light coming from it is constant
880,If a planet moves in front of the star the light from the star will be slightly obscured
881,If this happens regularly it is because a planets orbit is taking it in front of the star repeatedly
882,A second method is to measure the position of the star accurately
883,If a planet is orbiting the star it will induce a small wobble in the position of the star
884,This can be observed and again if it is a regular wobble then one deduces that it is due to a planet in orbit around the star
885,These methods were first applied about twenty years ago and by now a few thousand planets have been discovered orbiting distant stars
886,It is estimated that one star in five has an Earthlike planet orbiting it at a distance from the star to be compatible with life as we know it
887,Our own solar system was formed about four and a half billion years ago or a little more than nine billion years after the Big Bang from gas contaminated with the remains of earlier stars
888,The Earth was formed largely out of the heavier elements including carbon and oxygen
889,This has the famous doublehelix form discovered in the s by Francis Crick and James Watson in a hut on the New Museum site in Cambridge
890,Linking the two chains in the helix are pairs of nitrogenous bases
891,There are four types of nitrogenous basesadenine cytosine guanine and thymine
892,An adenine on one chain is always matched with a thymine on the other chain and a guanine with a cytosine
893,Thus the sequence of nitrogenous bases on one chain defines a unique complementary sequence on the other chain
894,The two chains can then separate and each acts as a template to build further chains
895,Thus DNA molecules can reproduce the genetic information coded in their sequences of nitrogenous bases
896,If the appearance of life on a given planet was very unlikely one might have expected it to take a long time
897,More precisely one might have expected life to appear as late as possible while still allowing time for the subsequent evolution to intelligent beings like us before the Sun swells up and engulfs the Earth
898,In that time an intelligent form of life could conceivably master space travel and be able to escape to another star
899,But if no escape is possible life on Earth would be doomed
900,There is fossil evidence that there was some form of life on Earth about three and a half billion years ago
901,This may have been only  million years after the Earth became stable and cool enough for life to develop
902,Once DNA appeared it would have been so successful that it might have completely replaced the earlier forms
903,RNA is like DNA but rather simpler and without the doublehelix structure
904,Short lengths of RNA could reproduce themselves like DNA and might eventually build up to DNA
905,We cannot make these nucleic acids in the laboratory from nonliving material
906,But given  million years and oceans covering most of the Earth there might be a reasonable probability of RNA being made by chance
907,Some would have been neutralthey would not have affected the function of the gene
908,And a few errors would have been favourable to the survival of the species these would have been chosen by Darwinian natural selection
909,The process of biological evolution was very slow at first
910,It took about two and a half billion years before the earliest cells evolved into multi cellular organisms
911,But it took less than another billion years for some of these to evolve into fish and for some of the fish in turn to evolve into mammals
912,It took only about a hundred million years to develop from the early mammals to us
913,The reason is that the early mammals already contained their versions of the essential organs we have
914,All that was required to evolve from early mammals to humans was a bit of finetuning
915,But with the human race evolution reached a critical stage comparable in importance with the development of DNA
916,This was the development of language and particularly written language
917,It meant that information could be passed on from generation to generation other than genetically through DNA
918,There has been some detectable change in human DNA brought about by biological evolution in the  years of recorded history but the amount of knowledge handed on from generation to generation has grown enormously
919,The DNA in a human egg or sperm contains about three billion base pairs of nitrogenous bases
920,So the total amount of useful information in our genes is probably something like a hundred million bits
921,One bit of information is the answer to a yesno question
922,By contrast a paperback novel might contain two million bits of information
923,Therefore a human is equivalent to about fifty  Harry Potter books and a major national library can contain about five million books or about ten trillion bits
924,The amount of information handed down in books or via the internet is  times as much as there is in DNA
925,Even more important is the fact that the information in books can be changed and updated much more rapidly
926,It has taken us several millionyears to evolve from less advanced earlier apes
927,During that time the useful information in our DNA has probably changed by only a few million bits so the rate of biological evolution in humans is about a bit a year
928,By contrast there are about  new books published in the English language each year containing of the order of a hundred billion bits of information
929,Of course the great majority of this information is garbage and no use to any form of life
930,This means that we have entered a new phase of evolution
931,But the external  recordin books and other longlasting forms of storagehas grown enormously
932,Some people would use the term evolution only for the internally transmitted genetic material and would object to it being applied to information handed down externally
933,We may be no stronger or inherently more intelligent than our caveman ancestors
934,I think it is legitimate to take a broader view and include externally transmitted information as well as DNA in the evolution of the human race
935,The timescale for evolution in the external transmission period is the timescale for accumulation of information
936,This used to be hundreds or even thousands of years
937,But now this timescale has shrunk to about fifty years or less
938,But nowadays if you read one book a day it would take you many tens of thousands of years to read through the books in a national library
939,This has meant that no one person can be the master of more than a small corner of human knowledge
940,This is likely to be a major limitation in the future
941,We certainly cannot continue for long with the exponential rate of growth of knowledge that we have had in the last  years
942,An even greater limitation and danger for future generations is that we still have the instincts and in particular the aggressive impulses that we had in caveman days
943,Aggression in the form of subjugating or killing other men and taking their women and food has had definite survival advantage up to the present time
944,But now it could destroy the entire human race and much of the rest of life on Earth
945,A nuclear war is still the most immediate danger but there are others such as the release of a genetically engineered virus
946,There is no time to wait for Darwinian evolution to make us more intelligent and better natured
947,Other qualities such as intelligence are probably controlled by a large number of genes and it will be much more difficult to find them and work out the relations between them
948,Laws will probably be passed against genetic engineering with humans
949,But some people wont be able to resist the temptation to improve human characteristics such as size of memory resistance to disease and length of life
950,If the human race manages to redesign itself to reduce or eliminate the risk of selfdestruction it will probably spread out and colonise otherplanets and stars
951,The natural lifetime for such beings is short compared with the travel time
952,According to the theory of relativity nothing can travel faster than light so a round trip from us to the nearest star would take at least eight years and to the centre of the galaxy about  years
953,In science fiction they overcome this difficulty by space warps or travel through extra dimensions
954,In the theory of relativity if one can travel faster than light one can also travel back in time and this would lead to problems with people going back and changing the past
955,One would also expect to have already seen large numbers of tourists from the future curious to look at our quaint oldfashioned ways
956,It might be possible to use genetic engineering to make DNAbased life survive indefinitely or at least for  years
957,These could be designed to last long enough for interstellar travel
958,These machines would be a new form of life based on mechanical and electronic components rather than macromolecules
959,They could eventually replace DNAbased life just as DNA may have replaced an earlier form of life
960,Another possibility is that there was a reasonable probability of forming self reproducing systems like cells but that most of these forms of life did not evolve intelligence
961,It is more likely that evolution is a random process with intelligence as only one of a large number of possible outcomes
962,It is not even clear that intelligence has any longterm survival value
963,Bacteria and other singlecell organisms may live on if all other life on Earth is wiped out by our actions
964,This is a good fraction of the total time available before the Sun blows up so it would be consistent with the hypothesis that the probability for life to develop intelligence is low
965,In this case we might expect to find many other life forms in the galaxy but we are unlikely to find intelligent life
966,In  we observed the collision of a comet ShoemakerLevy with Jupiter
967,It is thought the collision of a rather smaller body with the Earth about sixtysix million years ago was responsible for the extinction of the dinosaurs
968,A few small early mammals survived but anything as large as a human would have almost certainly been wiped out
969,If this figure is correct it would mean that intelligent life on Earth has developed only because of the lucky chance that there have been no major collisions in the last sixtysix million years
970,A third possibility is that there is a reasonable probability for life toform and to evolve to intelligent beings but the system becomes unstable and the intelligent life destroys itself
971,This would be a very pessimistic conclusion and I very much hope it isnt true
972,I prefer a fourth possibility that there are other forms of intelligent life out there but that we have been overlooked
973,In  I was involved in the launch of the Breakthrough Listen Initiatives
974,Breakthrough Listen uses radio observations to search for intelligent extraterrestrial life and has stateoftheart facilities generous funding and thousands of hours of dedicated radio telescope time
975,It is the largest ever scientific research programme aimed at finding evidence of civilisations beyond Earth
976,Breakthrough Message is an international competition to create messages that could be read by an advanced civilisation
977,But we need to be wary of answering back until we have developed a bit further
978,Meeting a more advanced civilisation at our present stage might be a bit like the original inhabitants of America meeting Columbusand I dont think they thought they were better off for it
979,And I think we wouldve known if we had been visited it would be like the film  Independence Day
980,CAN WE PREDICT THE FUTUREI n ancient times the world must have seemed pretty arbitrary
981,Disasters such as floods plagues earthquakes or volcanoes must have seemed to happen without warning or apparent reason
982,Many people still partially subscribe to this belief and try to make a pact with fortune
983,They offer to behave better or be kinder if only they can get an Agrade for a course or pass their driving test
984,These regularities were most obvious in the motion of the heavenly bodies across the sky
985,It was put on a firm mathematical basis by Newton more than  years ago and we still use his theory of gravity to predict the motion of almost all celestial bodies
986,Following the example of astronomy it was found that other natural phenomena also obeyed definite scientific laws
987,I would like to quote to you Laplaces actual words but Laplace was rather like Proust in that he wrote sentences of inordinate length and complexity
988,I dont think that Laplace was claiming that God didnt exist
989,It is just that God doesnt intervene to break the laws of science
990,The idea that the state of the universe at one time determines the state at all other times has been a central tenet of science ever since Laplaces time
991,It implies that we can predict the future in principle at least
992,A butterfly flapping its wings in Australia can cause rain in Central Park New York
993,Despite these practical difficulties scientific determinism remained the official dogma throughout the nineteenth century
994,This was put forward in  by the German physicist Max Planck as an ad hoc hypothesis to solve an outstanding paradox
995,According to the classical nineteenthcentury ideas dating back to Laplace a hot body like a piece of redhot metal should give off radiation
996,It would lose energy in radio waves the infrared visible light ultraviolet Xrays and gamma rays all at the same rate
997,It is a bit like saying that you cant buy sugar loose in the supermarket it has to be in kilogram bags
998,The energy in the packets or quanta is higher for ultraviolet and Xrays than for infrared or visible light
999,It means thatunless a body is very hot like the Sun it will not have enough energy to give off even a single quantum of ultraviolet or Xrays
1000,For example it was found that elementary particles behaved rather like little tops spinning about an axis
1001,But the amount of spin couldnt have just any value
1002,It had to be some multiple of a basic unit
1003,Because this unit is very small one does not notice that a normal top really slows down in a rapid sequence of discrete steps rather than as a continuous process
1004,But for tops as small as atoms the discrete nature of spin is very important
1005,It was some time before people realised the implications of this quantum behaviour for determinism
1006,It was not until  that Werner Heisenberg another German physicist pointed out that you couldnt measure simultaneously both the position and speed of a particle exactly
1007,But by Plancks work one cant use an arbitrarily small amount of light
1008,This will disturb the particle and change its speed in a way that cant be predicted
1009,To measure the position of the particle accurately you will have to use light of short wavelength like ultraviolet Xrays or gamma rays
1010,But again by Plancks work quanta of these forms of light have higher energies than those of visible light
1011,So they will disturb the speed of the particle more
1012,It is a nowin situation the more accurately you try to measure the position of the particle the less accurately you can know the speed and vice versa
1013,This is summed up in the Uncertainty Principle that Heisenberg formulated the uncertainty in the position of a particle times the uncertainty in its speed is always greater than a quantity called Plancks constant divided by twice the mass of the particle
1014,Laplaces vision of scientific determinism involved knowing the positions and speeds of the particles in the universe at one instant of time
1015,Einstein was very unhappy about this apparent randomness in nature
1016,His views were summed up in his famous phrase God does not play dice
1017,This reality might be known to God but the quantum nature of light would prevent us seeing it except through a glass darkly
1018,Hidden variable theories might seem to be the most obvious way to incorporate the Uncertainty Principle into physics
1019,They form the basis of the mental picture of the universe held by many scientists and almost all philosophers of science
1020,The British physicist John Bell devised an experimental test that could falsify hidden variable theories
1021,Thus it seems that even God is bound by the Uncertainty Principle and cannot know both the position and the speed of a particle
1022,Other scientists were much more ready than Einstein to modify the classical nineteenthcentury view of determinism
1023,A new theory quantum mechanics was put forward by Heisenberg Erwin Schrdinger from Austria and the British physicist Paul Dirac
1024,Dirac was my predecessor but one as the Lucasian Professor in Cambridge
1025,Yet it should concern us all because it is completely different from the classical picture of the physical universe and of reality itself
1026,In quantum mechanics particles dont have welldefined positions and speeds
1027,The size of the wave function gives the probability that the particle will be found in that position
1028,One can have a wave function that is verystrongly peaked in a small region
1029,This will mean that the uncertainty in the position is small
1030,But the wave function will vary very rapidly near the peak up on one side and down on the other
1031,The wave function contains all that one can know of the particle both its position and its speed
1032,Thus one still has a kind of determinism but it is not the sort that Laplace envisaged
1033,Instead of being able to predict the positions and speeds of particles all we can predict is the wave function
1034,The problem arises because gravity can warp spacetime so much that there can be regions of space that we cant observe
1035,That means that we cannot even in principle observe the particles inside a black hole
1036,So we cannot measure their positions or velocities at all
1037,There is then an issue of whether this introduces further unpredictability beyond that found in quantum mechanics
1038,To sum up the classical view put forward by Laplace was that the future motion of particles was completely determined if one knew their positions and speeds at one time
1039,But perhaps even this limited predictability might disappear if black holes are taken into account
1040,In principle the laws allow us to predict the future
1041,Black holes are stranger than anything dreamed up by sciencefiction writers but they are firmly matters of science fact
1042,The first discussion of black holes was in  by a Cambridge man John Michell
1043,If one fires a particle such as a cannon ball vertically upwards it will be slowed down by gravity
1044,Eventually the particle will stop moving upwards and will fall back
1045,The  escape velocity is just over  kilometres per second for the Earth and about  kilometres per second for the Sun
1046,Both of these are much higher than the speed of real cannon balls
1047,Thus light can get away from the Earth or Sun without much difficulty
1048,We would not be able to see them because any light they sent out would be dragged back by gravity
1049,Although gravity is by far the weakest of the known forces of nature it has two crucial advantages over other forces
1050,The Earth is held in orbit by the Sun ninetythree million miles away and the Sun is held in orbit around the centre of the galaxy about  light years away
1051,These two features mean that for a sufficiently large star the gravitational attraction between particles can dominate over all other forces and lead to gravitational collapse
1052,Albert Einstein even wrote a paper in  claiming that stars could not collapse under gravity because matter could not be compressed beyond a certain point
1053,In his work in the s and s he emphasised that many stars would eventually collapse and explored the problems this posed for theoretical physics
1054,In some cases it may be able to support itself as a white dwarf star the dense remnants of a stellar core
1055,A similar maximum mass was calculated by the Russian physicist Lev Landau for a star made entirely of neutrons
1056,And that if one neglected pressure a uniform spherically systematic symmetric star would contract to a singlepoint of infinite density
1057,In fact it marks the end of space and time itself
1058,Most scientists including Robert Oppenheimer switched their attention to nuclear physics and the issue of gravitational collapse was largely forgotten
1059,Interest in the subject revived with the discovery of distant objects called quasars
1060,They were bright despite being at great distances from the Earth
1061,Nuclear processes could not account for their energy output because they release only a small fraction of their rest mass as pure energy
1062,The only alternative was gravitational energy released by gravitational collapse
1063,It was clear that a uniform spherical star would contract to a point of infinite density a singularity
1064,This means that at this point of infinite density one cant predict the future
1065,We wouldnt be affected by the breakdown of prediction if the singularities are not nakedthat is they are not shielded from the outside
1066,Penrose proposed the cosmic censorship conjecture all singularities formed by the collapse of stars or other bodies are hidden from view inside black holes
1067,The cosmic censorship conjecture is almost certainly true because a number of attempts to disprove it have failed
1068,John Wheeler is known for expressing this principle as A black hole has no hair
1069,A black hole has a boundary called the event horizon
1070,Because nothing can travel faster than light everything else will get dragged back also
1071,Falling through the event horizon is a bit like going over Niagara Falls in a canoe
1072,If you are above the Falls you can get away if you paddle fast enough but once you are over the edge you are lost
1073,As you get nearer the Falls the current gets faster
1074,This means it pulls harder on the front of the canoe than the back
1075,Theres a danger that the canoe will be pulled apart
1076,If you fall towards a black hole feet first gravity will pull harder on your feet than your head because they are nearer the black hole
1077,The result is that you will be stretched out lengthwise and squashed in sideways
1078,If the black hole has a mass of a few times our Sun you would be torn apart and made into spaghetti before you reached the horizon
1079,So if you want to explore the inside of a black hole make sure you choose a big one
1080,There is a black hole with a mass of about four million times that of the Sun at the centre of our Milky Way galaxy
1081,Although you wouldnt notice anything in particular as you fell into a black hole someone watching you from a distance would never see you cross the event horizon
1082,Instead you would appear to slow down and hover just outside
1083,Your image would get dimmer and dimmer and redder and redder until you were effectively lost from sight
1084,As far as the outside world is concerned you would be lost for ever
1085,Shortly after the birth of my daughter Lucy I had a eureka moment
1086,Moreover if two black holes collide and merge to form a single black hole the area of the event horizon around the resulting black hole is greater than the sum of the areas of the event horizons around the original black holes
1087,The area theorem can be tested experimentally by the Laser Interferometer GravitationalWave Observatory LIGO
1088,On September   LIGO detected gravitational waves from the collision and merger of two black holes
1089,From the waveform one can estimate the masses and angular momenta of the black holes and by the nohair theorem these determine the horizon areas
1090,These properties suggest that there is a resemblance between the area of the event horizon of a black hole and conventional classical physics specifically the concept of entropy in thermodynamics
1091,Entropy can be regarded as a measure of the disorder of a system or equivalently as a lack of knowledge of its precise state
1092,The famous second law of thermodynamics says that entropy always increases with time
1093,This discovery was the first hint of this crucial connection
1094,The analogy between the properties of black holes and the laws of thermodynamics can be extended
1095,The first law of thermodynamics says that a small change in the entropy of a system is accompanied by a proportional change in the energy of the system
1096,Brandon Carter Jim Bardeen and I found a similar law relating the change in mass of a black hole to a change in the area of the event horizon
1097,If one accepts that the area of the event horizon is analogous to entropy then it would seem that the surface gravity is analogous to temperature
1098,This makes it look as if the final black hole state is independent of whether the body that collapsed was composed of matter or antimatter or whether it was spherical or highly irregular in shape
1099,In other words a black hole of a given mass angular momentum and electric charge could have been formed by the collapse of any one of a large number of different configurations of matter
1100,Indeed if quantum effects are neglected the number of configurations would be infinite since the black hole could have been formed by the collapse of a cloud of an indefinitely large number of particles of indefinitely low mass
1101,But could the number of configurations really be infinite Quantum mechanics famously involves the Uncertainty Principle
1102,This states that it is impossible to measure both the position and speed of any object
1103,If one measures the speed of something then its position is undetermined
1104,In practice this means that it is impossible to localise anything
1105,You can never do this accurately because it will involve making a measurement of both the positions of something and its speed at the same time
1106,In turn it is then impossible to determine the size of an object
1107,It turns out that the Uncertainty Principle imposes a limit on the size of something
1108,After a little bit of calculation one finds that for a given mass of an object there is a minimum size
1109,This minimum size is small for heavy objects but as one looks at lighter and lighter objects the minimum size gets bigger and bigger
1110,This minimum size can be thought of as a consequence of the fact that in quantum mechanics objects can be thought of either as a wave or a particle
1111,The lighter an object is the longer its wavelength is and so it is more spread out
1112,The heavier an object is the shorter its wavelength and so it will seem more compact
1113,That weight is about the same as that of a grain of salt
1114,A further consequence of these ideas is that the number of configurations that could form a black hole of a given mass angular momentum and electric charge although very large may also be finite
1115,Jacob Bekenstein suggested that from this finite number one could interpret the entropy of a black hole
1116,This would imply that a black hole could be in equilibrium with thermal radiation at some temperature other than zero
1117,Yet according to classical concepts no such equilibrium is possible since the black hole would absorb any thermal radiation that fell on it but by definition would not be able to emit anything in return
1118,This created a paradox about the nature of black holes the incredibly dense objects created by the collapse of stars
1119,One theory suggested that black holes with identical qualities could be formed from an infinite number of different types of stars
1120,This is a problem of informationthe idea that every particle and every force in the universe contains information
1121,This means that a black hole must contain a lot of information that is hidden from the outside world
1122,But there is a limit to the amount of information one can pack into a region of space
1123,Information requires energy and energy has mass by Einsteins famous equation E  mc
1124,So if theres too much information in a region of space it will collapse into a black hole and the size of the black hole will reflect the amount of information
