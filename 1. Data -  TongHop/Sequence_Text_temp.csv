0,MIN READ NASAs TESS Finds Intriguing World Sized Between Earth Venus Using observations by NASAs TESS Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and many other facilities two international teams of astronomers have discovered a planet between the sizes of Earth and Venus only  lightyears away
1,Multiple factors make it a candidate wellsuited for further study using NASAs James Webb Space Telescope
2,Hurt CaltechIPAC TESS stares at a large swath of the sky for about a month at a time tracking the brightness changes of tens of thousands of stars at intervals ranging from  seconds to  minutes
3,Capturing transits  brief regular dimmings of stars caused by the passage of orbiting worlds  is one of the missions primary goals
4,Although we dont yet know whether it possesses an atmosphere weve been thinking of it as an exoVenus with similar size and energy received from its star as our planetary neighbor in the solar system
5,The host star called Gliese  is a cool red dwarf located almost  lightyears away in the constellation Pisces
6,The star is only about  of the Suns size with about  of the Suns surface temperature
7,days and is Earths size or slightly smaller  comparable to Venus
8,Assuming it has no atmosphere the planet has a surface temperature estimated at around  degrees Fahrenheit  degrees Celsius
9,Astronomers say that the diminutive sizes and masses of red dwarf stars make them ideal for finding Earthsize planets
10,A smaller star means greater dimming for each transit and a lower mass means an orbiting planet can produce a greater wobble known as reflex motion of the star
11,Gliese  bs estimated size may be as large as Earth or slightly smaller  comparable to Venus in our solar system
12,This artists concept compares Earth with different possible Gliese  b interpretations from one with no atmosphere to one with a thick Venuslike one
13,This makes it easier to detect transiting planets within habitable zones around red dwarfs than those around stars emitting more energy
14,The distance separating Gliese  and the new planet is just  of the distance between Earth and the Sun
15,Gliese  b represents one of the best targets to study whether Earthsize planets orbiting cool stars can retain their atmospheres a crucial step to advance our understanding of habitability on planets across our galaxy said Shishir Dholakia a doctoral student at the Centre for Astrophysics at the University of Southern Queensland in Australia
16,He coled a different research team with Larissa Palethorpe a doctoral student at the University of Edinburgh and University College London
17,Both teams suggest that studying Gliese  b may help unlock some aspects of our own solar systems evolution
18,It is thought that Earths and Venuss first atmospheres were stripped away and then replenished by volcanic outgassing and bombardments from residual material in the solar system Palethorpe explained
19,The Earth is habitable but Venus is not due to its complete loss of water
20,Because Gliese  b is between Earth and Venus in temperature its atmosphere could teach us a lot about the habitability pathways planets take as they develop
21,One important factor in retaining an atmosphere is the storminess of its star
22,Red dwarfs tend to be magnetically active resulting in frequent powerful Xray flares
23,A paper led by Kuzuhara and Fukui was published May  in The Astrophysical Journal Letters
24,The Dholakia and Palethorpe findings were published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society on the same day
25,During a transit the host stars light passes through any atmosphere
26,Different gas molecules absorb different colors so the transit provides a set of chemical fingerprints that can be detected by telescopes like Webb
27,We know of only a handful of temperate planets similar to Earth that are both close enough to us and meet other criteria needed for this kind of study called transmission spectroscopy using current facilities said Michael McElwain a research astrophysicist at NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt Maryland and a coauthor of the Kuzuhara and Fukui paper
28,To better understand the diversity of atmospheres and evolutionary outcomes for these planets we need more examples like Gliese  b

33,Webbs instruments are so sensitive that they were able to detect an unusual amount of dense gas surrounding these galaxies
34,This gas will likely end up fueling the formation of new stars in the galaxies
35,These galaxies are like sparkling islands in a sea of otherwise neutral opaque gas explained Kasper Heintz the lead author and an assistant professor of astrophysics at the Cosmic Dawn Center DAWN at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark
36,Without Webb we would not be able to observe these very early galaxies let alone learn so much about their formation
37,Were moving away from a picture of galaxies as isolated ecosystems
38,At this stage in the history of the universe galaxies are all intimately connected to the intergalactic medium with its filaments and structures of pristine gas added Simone Nielsen a coauthor and PhD student also based at DAWN
39,This suggests that we are seeing the assembly of neutral hydrogen gas into galaxies
40,That gas will go on to cool clump and form new stars
41,The universe was a very different place several hundred million years after the big bang during a period known as the Era of Reionization
42,Gas throughout the universe only became fully transparent around  billion years after the big bang
43,Galaxies stars contributed to heating and ionizing the gas around them causing the gas to eventually become completely transparent
44,By matching Webbs data to models of star formation the researchers also found that these galaxies primarily have populations of young stars
45,The fact that we are seeing large gas reservoirs also suggests that the galaxies have not had enough time to form most of their stars yet Watson added
46,This is Only the Start Webb is not only meeting the mission goals that drove its development and launch  it is exceeding them
47,Images and data of these distant galaxies were impossible to obtain before Webb explained Gabriel Brammer a coauthor and associate professor at DAWN
48,The next step is to build large statistical samples of galaxies and quantify the prevalence and prominence of their features in detail Heintz said
49,This work has been published in the May   issue of the journal Science
50,The James Webb Space Telescope is the worlds premier space science observatory
51,Webb is solving mysteries in our solar system looking beyond to distant worlds around other stars and probing the mysterious structures and origins of our universe and our place in it

56,That may sound impossible but its actually true said Richard Kelley the U
57,principal investigator for XRISM at NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt Maryland
58,The Resolve instrument gives us a deeper look at the makeup and motion of Xrayemitting objects using technology invented and refined at Goddard over the past several decades
59,XRISM pronounced crism is led by JAXA Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency in collaboration with NASA along with contributions from ESA European Space Agency
60,It launched into orbit last September and has been scrutinizing the cosmos ever since
61,It will probe the universes hottest regions largest structures and objects with the strongest gravity like supermassive black holes in the cores of distant galaxies
62,The device produces a spectrum of Xray sources between  and  electron volts  up to  times the energy of visible light  with unprecedented detail
63,Its detector takes the temperature of each Xray that strikes it said Brian Williams NASAs XRISM project scientist at Goddard
64,We call Resolve a microcalorimeter spectrometer because each of its  pixels is measuring tiny amounts of heat delivered by each incoming Xray allowing us to see the chemical fingerprints of elements making up the sources in unprecedented detail
65,In order to accomplish this the entire detector must be chilled to
66,The instrument is so precise it can detect the motions of elements within a target effectively providing a D view
67,Gas moving toward us glows at slightly higher energies than normal while gas moving away from us emits slightly lower energies
68,This will for example allow scientists to better understand the flow of hot gas within clusters of galaxies and to track the movement of different elements in the debris of supernova explosions
69,Resolve is taking astronomers into a new era of cosmic exploration  and with only threedozen pixels
70,XRISM is a collaborative mission between JAXA and NASA with contributions from over  institutions in Japan the U
71,NASA Goddard developed the Resolve detector and many of the instrument subsystems together with the two Xray Mirror Assemblies

106,billion years ago the universe began with a rapid expansion we call the big bang
107,Nine billion years after the universe began its expansion started to speed up driven by an unknown force that scientists have named dark energy
108,But we do know that it exists its making the universe expand at an accelerating rate and approximately
109,The history of the universe is outlined in this infographic
110,NASA A Brief History It All Started With Cepheids Dark energy wasnt discovered until the late s
111,All Cepheid stars with a certain period a Cepheids period is the time it takes to go from bright to dim and bright again have the same absolute magnitude or luminosity  the amount of light they put out
112,Leavitt measured these stars and proved that there is a relationship between their regular period of brightness and luminosity
113,Leavitts findings made it possible for astronomers to use a stars period and luminosity to measure the distances between us and Cepheid stars in faroff galaxies and our own Milky Way
114,Around this same time in history astronomer Vesto Slipher observed spiral galaxies using his telescopes spectrograph a device that splits light into the colors that make it up much like the way a prism splits light into a rainbow
115,He used the spectrograph a relatively recent invention at the time to see the different wavelengths of light coming from the galaxies in different spectral lines
116,These observations would prove to be critical for many future scientific breakthroughs including the discovery of dark energy
117,Light behaves like a wave and red light has the longest wavelength
118,So the light coming from objects moving away from us has a longer wavelength stretching to the red end of the electromagnetic
119,In the years that followed different scientists around the world started to put the pieces of an expanding universe together
120,In  Russian scientist and mathematician Alexander Friedmann published a paper detailing multiple possibilities for the history of the universe
121,Astronomer Edwin Hubble confirmed that the universe was expanding in  using observations made by his associate astronomer Milton Humason
122,Hubble and Humason then studied Cepheid stars in those galaxies using the stars to determine the distance of their galaxies or nebulae as they called them
123,The pair found that objects like galaxies are moving away from Earth faster the farther away they are at upwards of hundreds of thousands of miles per second  an observation now known as Hubbles Law or the HubbleLematre law
124,This composite image features one of the most complicated and dramatic collisions between galaxy clusters ever seen
125,Known officially as Abell  this system has been dubbed Pandoras Cluster because of the wide variety of different structures found
126,Astronomers think at least four galaxy clusters coming from a variety of directions are involved with this collision
127,These groups were led by astronomers Adam Riess Saul Perlmutter and Brian Schmidt
128,This trio won the  Nobel Prize in Physics for this work
129,So they knew that there must be another factor making these objects appear dimmer
130,Scientists can determine distance and speed using an objects brightness and dimmer objects are typically farther away though surrounding dust and other factors can cause an object to dim
131,This led the scientists to conclude that these supernovae were just much farther away than they expected by looking at their redshifts
132,Using the objects brightness the researchers determined the distance of these supernovae
133,They found that the supernovae were not as close as expected meaning they had traveled farther away from us faster than ancitipated
134,These observations led scientists to ultimately conclude that the universe itself must be expanding faster over time
135,While other possible explanations for these observations have been explored astronomers studying even more distant supernovae or other cosmic phenomena in more recent years continued to gather evidence and build support for the idea that the universe is expanding faster over time a phenomenon now called cosmic acceleration
136,Dark energy has been described by some as having the effect of a negative pressure that is pushing space outward
137,Keep in mind that its possible its something else entirely
138,Originally the constant existed to counterbalance gravity resulting in a static universe
139,They suggested that this additional force would be necessary to accelerate the expansion of the universe
140,According to quantum field theory there are virtual particles or pairs of particles and antiparticles
141,Its thought that these virtual particles cancel each other out almost as soon as they crop up in the universe and that this act of popping in and out of existence could be made possible by vacuum energy that fills the cosmos and pushes space outward
142,This means that the amount of vacuum energy in the cosmos must be much smaller than it is in these predictions
143,Quintessence Some scientists think that dark energy could be a type of energy fluid or field that fills space behaves in an opposite way to normal matter and can vary in its amount and distribution throughout both time and space
144,This hypothesized version of dark energy has been nicknamed quintessence after the theoretical fifth element discussed by ancient Greek philosophers
145,Its even been suggested by some scientists that quintessence could be some combination of dark energy and dark matter though the two are currently considered completely separate from one another
146,While the two are both major mysteries to scientists dark matter is thought to make up about  of all matter in the universe
147,A Flaw in General Relativity Some scientists think that dark energy isnt something physical that we can discover
148,Within this explanation scientists think that its possible to modify our understanding of gravity in a way that explains observations of the universe made without the need for dark energy
149,Einstein actually proposed such an idea in  called unimodular gravity a modified version of general relativity that scientists today think wouldnt require dark energy to make sense of the universe
150,The Future Dark energy is one of the great mysteries of the universe
151,This map will include observations of billions of galaxies found up to  billion lightyears from Earth
152,NASAs Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope set to launch by May  is designed to investigate dark energy among many other science topics and will also create a D dark matter map
153,Romans resolution will be as sharp as NASAs Hubble Space Telescopes but with a field of view  times larger allowing it to capture more expansive images of the universe
154,Roman will also conduct an additional survey to detect Type Ia supernovae In addition to NASAs missions and efforts the Vera C
155,Rubin Observatory supported by a large collaboration that includes the U
156,Additionally NASAs James Webb Space Telescope launched in  the worlds most powerful and largest space telescope aims to make contributions to several areas of research and will contribute to studies of dark energy
157,NASAs SPHEREx the SpectroPhotometer for the History of the Universe Epoch of Reionization and Ices Explorer mission scheduled to launch no later than April  aims to investigate the origins of the universe
158,A brief note Lastly to clarify dark energy is not the same as dark matter
159,Credit Ed Bell for Simons Foundation The Discovery A planet that could resemble a smaller version of our own Neptune orbits one of two Sunlike stars that also orbit each other
160,The planet dwells in the habitable zone with a potentially moderate temperature and poses a challenge to prevailing ideas of planet formation
161,Key Facts Astronomers once imagined that our solar system  with its middleaged quiet Sun hosting small rocky planets in closer orbits and gas giants farther out  might be typical even runofthemill
162,But so far in an era of increasingly powerful planethunting technology its turning out to be anything but
163,Other planetary systems can look very different if not downright weird or are we the weird ones
164,A system called TOI  seems truly strange a mysterious type of planet known as a miniNeptune traces an Earthlike day orbit around one of two stars locked in their own orbital embrace
165,Details Among the thousands of exoplanets  planets beyond our solar system  confirmed in our galaxy so far most were detected using the transit method measuring the tiny dip in starlight as a planet crosses the face of its star
166,And most of these transit detections involve planets with short orbits their years  once around the star  lasting a few days or weeks
167,So the detection of planet TOI  c was a welcome departure
168,That isnt only because its day orbit places it in fairly exclusive company  transiting planets found so far with years longer than  days and only  over  days
169,The planet detected using TESS the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite also orbits in the habitable zone the distance from a star that could allow liquid water to form on a planetary surface
170,For planet c of course thats almost certainly not the case it most likely has a large dense atmosphere perhaps similar to Neptunes that would rule out surface water
171,The longer a planets orbital period the more likely it is to host a satellite so it isnt difficult to imagine a potentially habitable moon  la the fictional Pandora
172,The brightness of this system could make it a likely target in the continuing search for such exomoons
173,Measurements using a second detection method revealed a possible sibling planet with a day orbit
174,This one does not from Earths perspective cross the face of its star so its potential presence was revealed by radial velocity
175,The light coming from a star shifts slightly to and fro as the gravity of an orbiting planet tugs it one way then another followup investigations will be needed to confirm that the sibling planet suggested by radial velocity measurements is really there
176,Further investigation of this system also could prove important for understanding binary star systems or pairs of stars that orbit each other
177,A companion star in this case orbits the primary star in just  years allowing them to approach each other closely by interstellar standards
178,Scientists investigating the system also got an assist from more than a century ago archival data that was part of the Washington Double Star Catalog maintained by the U

182,MIN READ Discovery Alert An Earthsized World and Its Ultracool Star An artists concept of the exoplanet SPECULOOS b orbiting its red dwarf star
183,The planet is as big around as Earth while its star is slightly bigger than Jupiter  but much more massive
184,Credit NASAJPLCaltech Our galaxy is a jewel box of red stars
185,More than  of the stars in the Milky Way are M dwarfs also known as red dwarfs
186,These stars are cool and dim compared with our Sun but they often blast orbiting exoplanets with highenergy radiation especially early in their lives
187,Stars like our Sun burn for about  billion years before turning into hungry red giants devouring any planets too nearby
188,M dwarfs keep burning for  billion years or more perhaps offering a foothold for life and an even longer window for life to develop
189,An international team using robotic telescopes around the world recently spotted an Earthsized planet orbiting an ultracool red dwarf the dimmest and longestlived of stars
190,A year there one orbit around the star takes about  hours
191,The days and nights though may never end The planet is thought to be tidally locked so the same side known as the dayside always faces the star like the Moon to Earth
192,The Details In our corner of the galaxy ultracool dwarf stars are ubiquitous
193,They are so faint that their planetary population is largely unexplored
194,The SPECULOOS Search for Planets EClipsing ULtracOOl Stars project led by Michael Gillon at the University of Lige Belgium was designed to change that
195,Ultracool dwarf stars are scattered across the sky so you need to observe them one by one for weeks to get a good chance to detect transiting planets
196,For that you need a dedicated network of professional telescopes
197,We designed SPECULOOS specifically to explore nearby ultracool dwarf stars in search of rocky planets Gillon said
198,With the SPECULOOS prototype and the crucial help of the NASA Spitzer Space Telescope we discovered the famous TRAPPIST system
199,That was an excellent start Gillon is the lead author of the paper announcing the planets discovery published May   in Nature Astronomy
200,The project is a true international endeavor with partnership with the Universities of Cambridge Birmingham Bern Massachusetts Institute of Technology and ETH Zrich
201,The SPECULOOS star is thousands of degrees cooler than our Sun with an average temperature of about  F  C but it pummels its planet with radiation meaning theres likely no atmosphere
202,Seeing the star let alone the planet is a feat in itself
203,Though this particular red dwarf is more than a thousand times dimmer than the Sun its planet orbits much much closer than the Earth heating up the planetary surface said coauthor Catherine Clark a postdoctoral researcher at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California
204,Fun facts While the planet is as big around as Earth its star is just a tad bigger than Jupiter  but much more massive
205,The planet receives almost  times more energy per second than Earth receives from the Sun
206,Did you catch the cookie connection The planetfinding program SPECULOOS shares its name with the spiced shortbread
207,Sweet  The Next Steps SPECULOOS b is an excellent candidate for followup observations by the James Webb Space Telescope
208,Not only might we learn about the potential for an atmosphere and about the surface mineralogy but it might also help us understand the stellar neighborhood and our place in it
209,Were making great strides in our study of planets orbiting other stars
210,The next step will be to determine whether any of them are habitable or even inhabited said Steve B

213,Scattered across the universe black holes are objects with gravity so powerful nothing can escape their grasp
214,Seen nearly edgewise the turbulent disk of gas churning around a black hole takes on a bizarre doublehumped appearance
215,NASAs Goddard Space Flight CenterJeremy Schnittman Scientists have theorized about the existence of black holes since the th century
216,Now astronomers have a growing understanding of these strange gravitational powerhouses that form from the collapsed cores of dying stars
217,While scientists have dramatically improved our understanding of black holes since that first detection these objects remain quite mysterious
218,This is in part because light cant escape from a black hole so they cannot be observed directly with telescopes
219,Instead astronomers primarily look for the ways that black holes influence and distort matter around them
220,While there are objects just as massive as some black holes they dont have the same density
221,Black holes are extremely massive but that mass is concentrated in a smaller area creating a high density that increases the maximum force of a black holes gravity by allowing objects to get very close to all of that mass
222,So tidal forces refer to the distortion of one object by another due to the difference in the gravitational pull on the near and far side of an object
223,Due to a black holes extreme density objects in its vicinity will experience extreme gravity and hence extreme tidal forces that can even pull the object apart
224,Watch eight model stars stretch and deform as they approach a virtual black hole  million times the mass of the Sun
225,The black hole rips some stars apart into a stream of gas a phenomenon called a tidal disruption event
226,For any object falling into a black hole the part closer to the black hole will feel a stronger gravitational pull than the part farther away from the black hole
227,This difference in gravitational pull increases as the object gets closer to the event horizon
228,The difference in gravitational pull isnt unique to black holes but their extreme density creates an extreme effect
229,This effect essentially stretches out the object more and more as the object gets closer to the black hole creating a long thin shape
230,In the book Hawking describes a fictional astronauts journey into a black holes event horizon
231,Just as gravity close to a black hole can stretch things out it can also flatten objects like pancakes
232,This is a phenomenon known as pancake detonation that primarily happens with supermassive black holes
233,In this phenomenon stars that get too close to these black holes will be flattened and compressed by tidal forces
234,This shortlived pancake distortion is followed by an explosive release of thermonuclear energy
235,This happens because massive objects like black holes create strong gravitational fields that curve and stretch the fabric of spacetime
236,We actually experience a very small amount of time dilation here on Earth because of Earths gravity
237,Astronauts living on the International Space Station also experience time at a slightly different rate because they are further from the gravitational pull of the Earth
238,To imagine time dilation in action picture an object traveling towards a black hole
239,As the object approaches the event horizon it appears to start moving infinitely slower until the object will appear completely frozen
240,Here gas and dust will collect swirl and flatten into this pancakeshaped disk
241,Matter in an accretion disk will continue to swirl and fall toward the event horizon of a black hole
242,As an object gets closer and closer the gravitational force will intensify and the matter will continue to be pulled apart and spaghettify
243,By its very nature a black hole cannot be seen but the hot disk of material that encircles it shines bright
244,Against that bright backdrop a black hole can appear to cast a shadow
245,In April  an international network of radio telescopes called the Event Horizon Telescope EHT captured this image of a black hole and its shadow for the first time
246,As matter in an accretion disk falls further inward towards a black hole it swirls around and the friction from this movement can create light ranging from radio waves to visible light and Xrays
247,Sometimes black holes can even redirect some of that infalling matter into jets of highspeed particles traveling away from the black hole that can emit gamma rays
248,Astronomers can use these jets of radiation to find black holes
249,All in all matter near a black hole can be spaghettified superheated squeezed pancaked pulled apart and swirled around all while time itself stretches in unusual ways
250,This is one part of the story that remains a mystery
251,NASA ESA CSA Ralf Crawford STScI The Problem with WASP b At more than threequarters the volume of Jupiter but less than onetenth the mass the warm Neptune exoplanet WASP b is one of the least dense planets known
252,While puffy planets are not uncommon most are hotter and more massive and therefore easier to explain
253,Based on its radius mass age and assumed internal temperature we thought WASP b had a very small rocky core surrounded by a huge mass of hydrogen and helium explained Luis Welbanks from Arizona State University ASU lead author on a paper published today in Nature
254,If WASP b instead has more of its mass in the core the atmosphere should have contracted as the planet cooled over time since it formed
255,Without a source of heat to reexpand the gas the planet should be much smaller
256,Although WASP b has an orbital distance of just  million miles oneseventh the distance between Mercury and the Sun it doesnt receive enough energy from its star to be so inflated
257,WASP b is such an interesting target for Webb because its significantly cooler and more Neptunelike in mass than many of the other lowdensity planets the hot Jupiters weve been studying said David Sing from the Johns Hopkins University JHU lead author on a parallel study also published today in Nature
258,As a result we should be able to detect methane and other molecules that can give us information about its chemistry and internal dynamics that we cant get from a hotter planet
259,Combining observations from Webbs NIRCam NearInfrared Camera Webbs MIRI MidInfrared Instrument and Hubbles WFC Wide Field Camera  Welbanks team was able to build a broad spectrum of
260,Using Webbs NIRSpec NearInfrared Spectrograph Sings team built an independent spectrum covering
261,The precision of the data makes it possible to not just detect but actually measure the abundances of a wealth of molecules including water vapor HO methane CH carbon dioxide CO carbon monoxide CO sulfur dioxide SO and ammonia NH
262,The spectrum includes light collected over four separate observations using a total of three different instruments Hubbles WFC Wide Field Camera  Grism Spectrometer in green Webbs NIRCam NearInfrared Camera Grism Spectrometer in orange and Webbs MIRI MidInfrared Instrument LowResolution Spectrometer in pink
263,This is evidence that hot gas from deep in the planet must be mixing vigorously with the cooler layers higher up explained Sing
264,The fact that we detected so little even though we did detect other carbonbearing molecules tells us that the interior of the planet must be significantly hotter than we thought
265,A likely source of WASP bs extra internal energy is tidal heating caused by its slightly elliptical orbit
266,With the distance between the star and planet changing continuously over the
267,day orbit the gravitational pull is also changing stretching the planet and heating it up
268,Researchers had previously proposed that tidal heating could be the cause of WASP bs puffiness but until the Webb results were in there was no evidence
269,Once they established that the planet has enough internal heat to thoroughly churn up the atmosphere the teams realized that the spectra could also provide a new way to estimate the size of the core
270,All together WASP b is not as mysterious as it once appeared
271,The Webb data tells us that planets like WASP b didnt have to form in some odd way with a super small core and a huge gassy envelope explained Mike Line from ASU
272,Instead we can take something more like Neptune with a lot of rock and not as much gas just dial up the temperature and poof it up to look the way it does
273,The James Webb Space Telescope is the worlds premier space science observatory
274,Webb is solving mysteries in our solar system looking beyond to distant worlds around other stars and probing the mysterious structures and origins of our universe and our place in it
275,Webb is an international program led by NASA with its partners ESA European Space Agency and CSA Canadian Space Agency

280,In this visualization of a flight toward a supermassive black hole labels highlight many of the fascinating features produced by the effects of general relativity along the way
281,Produced on a NASA supercomputer the simulation tracks a camera as it approaches briefly orbits and then crosses the event horizon  the point of no return  of a monster black hole much like the one at the center of our galaxy
282,Explainer videos act as sightseeing guides illuminating the bizarre effects of Einsteins general theory of relativity
283,Versions rendered as degree videos let viewers look all around during the trip while others play as flat allsky maps
284,To create the visualizations Schnittman teamed up with fellow Goddard scientist Brian Powell and used the Discover supercomputer at the NASA Center for Climate Simulation
285,The project generated about  terabytes of data  equivalent to roughly half of the estimated text content in the Library of Congress  and took about  days running on just
286,The same feat would take more than a decade on a typical laptop
287,million times the mass of our Sun equivalent to the monster located at the center of our Milky Way galaxy
288,If you have the choice you want to fall into a supermassive black hole Schnittman explained
289,This occurs because the gravitational pull on the end of an object nearer the black hole is much stronger than that on the other end
290,Infalling objects stretch out like noodles a process astrophysicists call spaghettification
291,The simulated black holes event horizon spans about  million miles  million kilometers or about  of the distance from Earth to the Sun
292,A flat swirling cloud of hot glowing gas called an accretion disk surrounds it and serves as a visual reference during the fall
293,A backdrop of the starry sky as seen from Earth completes the scene
294,Tour an alternative visualization that tracks a camera as it approaches falls toward briefly orbits and escapes a supermassive black hole
295,This immersive degree version allows viewers to look around during the flight
296,Powell View the flyby explainer on YouTube As the camera approaches the black hole reaching speeds ever closer to that of light itself the glow from the accretion disk and background stars becomes amplified in much the same way as the sound of an oncoming racecar rises in pitch
297,The movies begin with the camera located nearly  million miles  million kilometers away with the black hole quickly filling the view
298,Along the way the black holes disk photon rings and the night sky become increasingly distorted  and even form multiple images as their light traverses the increasingly warped spacetime
299,In real time the camera takes about  hours to fall to the event horizon executing almost two complete minute orbits along the way
300,But to anyone observing from afar it would never quite get there
301,As spacetime becomes ever more distorted closer to the horizon the image of the camera would slow and then seem to freeze just shy of it
302,At the event horizon even spacetime itself flows inward at the speed of light the cosmic speed limit
303,Once the camera crosses the horizon its destruction by spaghettification is just
304,This final leg of the voyage is over in the blink of an eye
305,In the alternative scenario the camera orbits close to the event horizon but it never crosses over and escapes to safety

308,MIN READ NASA Collaborating on Europeanled Gravitational Wave Observatory in Space The LISA Laser Interferometer Space Antenna mission led by ESA European Space Agency with NASA contributions will detect gravitational waves in space using three spacecraft separated by more than a million miles flying in a triangular formation
309,AEIMMExozet The first spacebased observatory designed to detect gravitational waves has passed a major review and will proceed to the construction of flight hardware
310,ESA European Space Agency announced the formal adoption of LISA the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna to its mission lineup with launch slated for the mids
311,ESA leads the mission with NASA serving as a collaborative partner
312,In  the groundbased LIGO observatory cracked open the window into gravitational waves disturbances that sweep across spacetime the fabric of our universe said Mark Clampin director of the Astrophysics Division at NASA Headquarters in Washington
313,LISA will give us a panoramic view allowing us to observe a broad range of sources both within our galaxy and far far beyond it
314,Were proud to be part of this international effort to open new avenues to explore the secrets of the universe
315,The LISA mission will enable observations of gravitational waves produced by merging supermassive black holes seen here in a computer simulation
316,Most big galaxies contain central black holes weighing millions of times the mass of our Sun
317,Credit NASAs Goddard Space Flight CenterScott Noble simulation data dAscoli et al
318,NASA will provide several key components of LISAs instrument suite along with science and engineering support
319,NASA contributions include lasers telescopes and devices to reduce disturbances from electromagnetic charges
320,LISA will use this equipment as it measures precise distance changes caused by gravitational waves over millions of miles in space
321,ESA will provide the spacecraft and oversee the international team during the development and operation of the mission
322,Gravitational waves were predicted by Albert Einsteins general theory of relativity more than a century ago
323,They are produced by accelerating masses such as a pair of orbiting black holes
324,Because these waves remove orbital energy the distance between the objects gradually shrinks over millions of years and they ultimately merge
325,National Science Foundation measured gravitational waves from the merger of two black holes
326,Along with other groundbased facilities LIGO has since observed dozens more black hole mergers as well as mergers of neutron stars and neutron starblack hole systems
327,So far the black holes detected through gravitational waves have been relatively small with masses of tens to perhaps a hundred times that of our Sun
328,LISA is designed to sense lowfrequency gravitational waves that instruments on Earth cannot detect said Ira Thorpe the NASA study scientist for the mission at the agencys Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt Maryland
329,These sources encompass tens of thousands of small binary systems in our own galaxy as well as massive black holes merging as galaxies collided in the early universe
330,Gravitational waves from a simulated population of compact binary systems in our galaxy were used to construct this synthetic map of the entire sky
331,Such systems contain white dwarfs neutron stars or black holes in tight orbits
332,Maps like this using real data will be possible once the LISA mission becomes active in the next decade
333,The center of our Milky Way galaxy lies at the center of this allsky view with the galactic plane extending across the middle
334,Brighter spots indicate sources with stronger gravitational signals and lighter colors indicate those with higher frequencies
335,NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center LISA will consist of three spacecraft flying in a vast triangular formation that follows Earth in its orbit around the Sun
336,The spacecraft will track internal test masses affected only by gravity
337,At the same time theyll continuously fire lasers to measure their separations to within a span smaller than the size of a helium atom
338,Gravitational waves from sources throughout the universe will produce oscillations in the lengths of the triangles arms and LISA will capture these changes
339,The spacecraft demonstrated the exquisite control and precise laser measurements needed for LISA

341,New Images From Euclid Mission Reveal Wide View of the Dark Universe  MIN READ With NASA contributions the mission will complement dark energy studies to be made by the agencys upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope
342,Dark matter is an invisible substance five times more common in the universe than regular matter but with an unknown composition
343,Dark energy is the name given to the unknown source causing the universe to expand faster and faster
344,Scientists will then chart the presence of dark matter with higher precision than ever before
345,The five new images feature views of varying sizes  from a starforming region in the Milky Way galaxy to clusters of hundreds of galaxies  and were taken shortly after Euclids launch in July  as part of its early release observations program
346,The new images related science papers and data are available at the Euclid website
347,A prerecorded program by ESA about these findings is available on ESA TV and YouTube
348,Mission planners with NASAs forthcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will use Euclids findings to inform Romans complementary dark energy work
349,Scientists will use Roman with its better sensitivity and sharpness to extend the kind of science Euclid enables by studying fainter and more distant galaxies
350,Sometimes the warping is so powerful it can create rings pronounced arcs or multiple images of the same galaxy  a phenomenon called strong gravitational lensing
351,Because dark energy is a relatively weak effect we need larger surveys to give us more data and better statistical precision said Mike Seiffert the NASA project scientist for Euclid at the agencys Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California
352,We need to look at a much bigger area but still be able to detect these subtle effects
353,To make that happen we needed a specialized space telescope like Euclid
354,The telescope uses two instruments that detect different wavelengths of light the visiblelight imager VIS and the nearinfrared spectrometer and photometer NISP
355,Foreground galaxies emit more light in visible wavelengths those the human eye can perceive while background galaxies are typically brighter in infrared wavelengths
356,And Euclid can make these types of deep wide highresolution images hundreds of times faster than other telescopes
357,While dark matter and dark energy are central to the Euclid the mission has a variety of other astronomical applications
358,Euclids largearea sky map can for instance be used to discover faint objects and observe changes in cosmic objects like a star changing in brightness
359,Thought to form like stars but not quite large enough to begin fusion in their cores these objects highlight the differences between stars and planets
360,Its both thrilling and a little overwhelming to keep up with all the developments
361,In addition to designing and fabricating the sensorchip electronics for Euclids Near Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer NISP instrument JPL led the procurement and delivery of the NISP detectors as well
362,Those detectors along with the sensor chip electronics were tested at NASAs Detector Characterization Lab at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt Maryland

372,This book draws from this personal archive and was in development at the time of his death
373,It has been completed in collaboration with his academic colleagues his family and the Stephen Hawking Estate
374,A percentage of the royalties will go to the Motor Neurone Disease Association and the Stephen Hawking Foundation
375,Foreword Eddie Redmayne The first time I met Stephen Hawking I was struck by his extraordinary power and his vulnerability
376,He also insisted that I call him Stephen and stop referring to him as Professor
377,I had been told The opportunity to portray Stephen was an extraordinary one
378,I was drawn to the role because of the duality of Stephens external triumph in his scientific work and the internal battle against motor neurone disease starting in his early twenties
379,His was a unique complex rich story of human endeavour family life huge academic achievement and sheer defiance in the face of all obstacles
380,In my trailer I ended up having three images that I referred to
381,One was Einstein with his tongue out because theres that similar playful wit with Hawking
382,The greatest pressure in playing a living person is that you will have to account for your performance to the person you have portrayed
383,I replied that if it was otherwise perhaps he could just say otherwise and spare me the excoriating details
384,He was moved by it but famously he also stated that he thought there should have been more physics and fewer feelings
385,Since  The Theory of Everything  I have stayed in contact with the Hawking family
386,I was touched to be asked to give a reading at Stephens funeral
387,We have lost a truly beautiful mind an astonishing scientist and the funniest man I have ever had the pleasure to meet
388,But as his family said at the time of Stephens death his work and legacy will live on and so it is with sadness but also great pleasure that I introduce you to this collection of Stephens writings on diverse and fascinating topics
389,I hope you enjoy his writings and to quote Barack Obama I hope Stephen is having fun up there among the stars
390,Thorne I first met Stephen Hawking in July  in London England at a Conference on General Relativity and Gravitation
391,Stephen was in the midst of his PhD studies at the University of Cambridge I had just completed mine at Princeton University
392,Rumours swirled around the conference halls that Stephen had devised a compelling argument that our universe  must  have been born at some finite time in the past
393,So along with some  people I squeezed into a room designed for forty to hear Stephen speak
394,His lucid reasoning relied on Einsteins general relativity equations and on astronomers observations that our universe is expanding and on a few simple assumptions that seemed very likely to be true and it made use of some new mathematical techniques that Roger Penrose had recently devised
395,Combining all these in ways that were clever powerful and compelling Stephen deduced his result our universe must have begun in some sort of singular state roughly ten billion years ago
396,Not just by his argument and conclusion but more importantly by his insightfulness and creativity
397,So I sought him out and spent an hour talking privately with him
398,That was the beginning of a lifelongfriendship a friendship based not just on common science interests but on a remarkable mutual sympathy an uncanny ability to understand each other as human beings
399,Soon we were spending more time talking about our lives our loves and even death than about science though our science was still much of the glue that bound us together
400,In September  I took Stephen and his wife Jane to Moscow Russia
401,Despite the raging Cold War I had been spending a month or so in Moscow every other year since  collaborating on research with members of a group led by Yakov Borisovich Zeldovich
402,Zeldovich was a superb astrophysicist and also a father of the Soviet hydrogen bomb
403,Because of his nuclear secrets he was forbidden to travel to Western Europe or America
404,He craved discussions with Stephen he could not come to Stephen so we went to him
405,In Moscow Stephen wowed Zeldovich and hundreds of other scientists with his insights and in return Stephen learned a thing or two from Zeldovich
406,Most memorable was an afternoon that Stephen and I spent with Zeldovich and his PhD student Alexei Starobinsky in Stephens room in the Rossiya Hotel
407,Zeldovich explained in intuitive ways a remarkable discovery they had made and Starobinsky explained it mathematically
408,A black hole they explained can use its spin energy to create particles and the particles will fly away carrying the spin energy with them
409,We already knew other ways of extracting a black holes spin energy this was just a new though unexpected way
410,Now the great value of conversations like this is that they can trigger new directions of thought
411,He mulled over the ZeldovichStarobinsky discovery for several months looking at it first from one direction and then from another until one day it triggered a truly radical insight in Stephens mind after a black hole stops spinning the hole can still emit particles
412,It can radiateand it radiates as though the black hole was hot like the Sun though not very hot just mildly warm
413,A hole that weighs as much as the Sun has a temperature of
414,This Hawking temperature of a black hole and its Hawking radiation as they came to be called were truly radicalperhaps the most radical theoretical physics discovery in the second half of the twentieth century
415,He deduced that the amount of entropy the logarithm of the holes amount of randomness is proportional to the holes surface area
416,For the past fortyfive years Stephen and hundreds of other physicists have struggled to understand the precise nature of a black holes randomness
417,It is a question that keeps on generating new insights about the marriage of quantum theory with general relativitythat is about the illunderstood laws of quantum gravity
418,In autumn  Stephen brought his PhD students and his family his wife Jane and their two children Robert and Lucy to Pasadena California for a year so that he and his students could participate in the intellectual life of my university Caltech and merge temporarily with my own research group
419,During that year Stephen and his students and some of mine struggled to understand black holes more deeply as did I to some degree
420,But Stephens presence and his leadership in our joint groups black hole research gave me freedom to pursue a new direction that I had been contemplating for some years gravitational waves
421,Electromagnetic waves consist of oscillating electric and magnetic forces that travel at light speed
422,That information can then be amplified and fed into a loudspeaker or on to a TV screen for humans to comprehend
423,Gravitational waves according to Einstein consist of an oscillatory space warp an oscillating stretch and squeeze of space
424,Rai proposed using laser beams to measure the oscillating pattern of this stretch and squeeze
425,The laser light could extract a gravitational waves information and the signal could then be amplified and fed into a computer for human comprehension
426,During the  years since then electromagnetic astronomy has completely revolutionised our understanding of the universe
427,Gravitational waves we concluded are the ideal tool for exploring and testing Stephens insights about black holes
428,More generally it seemed to us gravitational waves are so radically different from electromagnetic waves that they were almost guaranteed to create their own new revolution in our understanding of the universe perhaps comparable to the enormous electromagnetic revolution that followed Galileo if  these elusive waves could be detected and monitored
429,So during that glorious year with Stephens and my research groups merged at Caltech I spent much of my time exploring the prospects for gravitationalwave success
430,Shortly after Stephens return to Cambridge my exploration reached fruition with an allnight intense discussion between Rai Weiss and me in Rais hotel room in Washington DC
431,I became convinced that the prospects for success were great enough that I should devote most of my own career and my future students research to helping Rai and other experimenters achieve our gravitationalwave vision
432,On September   the LIGO gravitationalwave detectors built by a person project that Rai and I and Ronald Drever cofounded and Barry Barish organised assembled and led registered their first gravitational waves
433,During our glorious year of  while I was dithering over gravitational waves and Stephen was leading our merged group in black hole research Stephen himself had an insight even more radical than hisdiscovery of Hawking radiation
434,This is radical because the laws of quantum physics insist unequivocally that information can never get totally lost
435,So if Stephen was right black holes violate a most fundamental quantum mechanical law
436,The great majority of theoretical physicists find this conclusion abhorrent
437,And so for fortyfour years they have struggled with this socalled informationloss paradox
438,It is a struggle well worth the effort and anguish that have gone into it since this paradox is a powerful key for understanding the quantum gravity laws
439,Stephen himself in  found a way that information might escape during the holes evaporation but that did not quell theorists struggles
440,Stephen did not  prove  that the information escapes so the struggle continues
441,In my eulogy for Stephen at the interment of his ashes at Westminster Abbey I memorialised that struggle with these words Newton gave us answers
442,And Hawkings questions themselves keep on giving generating breakthroughs decades later
443,I dont have enough skills wisdom or selfconfidence to tackle them
444,Stephen by contrast was always attracted to big questions whether they were deeply rooted in his science or not
445,He  did  have the necessary skills wisdom and self confidence
446,Stephens answers to six of the questions are deeply rooted in his science
447,Here you will find him discussing in depth the issues that Ive described briefly in this Introduction and also much much more
448,His answers to the other four big questions cannot possibly be rooted solidly in his science
449,Will we survive on Earth Is there other intelligent life in the universe Should we colonise space Will artificial intelligence outsmart us Nevertheless his answers display deep wisdom and creativity as we should expect
450,I hope you find his answers as stimulating and insightful as do I
451,But real science can be far stranger than science fiction and much more satisfying
452,And a scientist with a deep fascination with physics cosmology the universe and the future of humanity
453,I was brought up by my parents to have an unwavering curiosity and like my father to research and try to answer the many questions that science asks us
454,I have spent my life travelling across the universe inside my mind
455,Through theoretical physics I have sought to answer some of the great questions
456,At one point I thought I would see the end of physics as we know it but now I think the wonder of discovery will continue long after I am gone
457,We are close to some of these answers but we are not there yet
458,The problem is most people believe that real science is too difficult and complicated for them to understand
459,To do research on the fundamental laws that govern the universe would require a commitment of time that most people dont have the world would soon grind to a halt if we all tried to do theoretical physics
460,It has been a glorious time to be alive and doing research in theoreticalphysics
461,Our picture of the universe has changed a great deal in the last fifty years and Im happy if I have made a contribution
462,One of the great revelations of the space age has been the perspective it has given humanity on ourselves
463,It is such a simple image with a compelling message one planet one human race
464,Let them rise to the challenge of the sustainable development goals and act not out of selfinterest but out of common interest
465,I have written about my life before but some of my early experiences are worth repeating as I think about my lifelong fascination with the big questions
466,In fact a V rocket landed a few houses away from ours
467,I was away with my mother and sister at the time and fortunately my father was not hurt
468,In  my fathers place of work moved to the northern edge of London to the newly constructed National Institute for Medical Research in Mill Hill so my family relocated to the cathedral city of St Albansnearby
469,I was never more than about halfway up the classit was a very bright class but my classmates gave me the nickname Einstein so presumably they saw signs of something better
470,I had six or seven close friends in St Albans and I remember having long discussions and arguments about everything from radiocontrolled models to religion
471,One of the big questions we discussed was the origin of the universe and whether it required a God to create it and set it going
472,I had heard that light from distant galaxies was shifted towards the red end of the spectrum and this was supposed to indicate that the universe was expanding
473,But I was sure there must be some other reason for the red shift
474,Maybe light got tired and more red on its way to us An essentially unchanging and everlasting universe seemed so much more natural
475,It was only years later after the discovery of the cosmic microwave background about two years into my PhD research that I realised I had been wrong
476,My practical abilities never matched up to my theoretical qualities
477,My father encouraged my interest in science and was very keen that I should go to Oxford or Cambridge
478,He himself had gone to University College Oxford so he thought I should apply there
479,At that time University College had no fellow in mathematics so I had little option but to try for a scholarship in natural science
480,The prevailing attitude at Oxford at that time was very antiwork
481,You were supposed to be brilliant without effort or to accept your limitations and get a fourthclass degree
482,I took this as an invitation to do very little
483,Im not proud of this Im just describing my attitude at the time shared by most of my fellow students
484,One result of my illness has been to change all that
485,Because of my lack of work I had planned to get through the finalexam by avoiding questions that required any factual knowledge and focus instead on problems in theoretical physics
486,But I didnt sleep the night before the exam and so I didnt do very well
487,In the interview they asked me about my future plans
488,If they gave me a first I would go to Cambridge
489,If I only got a second I would stay in Oxford
490,In the long vacation following my final exam the college offered a number of small travel grants
491,I thought my chances of getting one would be greater the further I proposed to go so I said I wanted to go to Iran
492,In the summer of  I set out taking a train to Istanbul then on to Erzuerum in eastern Turkey then to Tabriz Tehran Isfahan Shiraz and Persepolis the capital of the ancient Persian kings
493,On my way home I and my travelling companion Richard Chiin were caught in the Bouin Zahra earthquake a massive
494,I must have been near the epicentre but I was unaware of it because I was ill and in a bus that was bouncing around on the Iranian roads that were then very uneven
495,Despite the earthquake I have many fond memories of my time in Iran
496,Intense curiosity about the world can put one in harms way but for me this was probably the only time in my life that this was true
497,I had applied to work with Fred Hoyle the most famous British astronomer of the time
498,I say astronomer because cosmology then was hardly recognised as a legitimate field
499,I began my work by reading old textbooks on general relativityas ever drawn to the biggest questions
500,The winter after I arrived in Cambridge was very cold
501,I fell over and had great difficulty getting up again
502,My mother realised something was wrong and took me to the doctor
503,I spent weeks in St Bartholomews Hospital in London and had many tests
504,I also learned that people with this disease gradually lose the ability to control their movements to speak to eat and eventually to breathe
505,Understandably I became depressed and couldnt see the point of continuing to research my PhD because I didnt know if I would live long enough to finish it
506,But then the progression slowed down and I had a renewed enthusiasm for my work
507,After my expectations had been reduced to zero every new day became abonus and I began to appreciate everything I did have
508,She was very determined that together we could fight my condition
509,Getting engaged lifted my spirits and I realised if we were going to get married I had to get a job and finish my PhD
510,To support myself during my studies I applied for a research fellowship at Gonvillle and Cauis College
511,To my great surprise I was elected and have been a fellow of Caius ever since
512,It meant that I could continue my research despite my increasing disability
513,Our first child Robert was born after we had been married about two years
514,Our second child Lucy was born about three years later
515,As a father I would try to instill the importance of asking questions always
516,He wanted to know if there were lots of tiny universes dotted around
517,Surely I thought we already knew that nothing could prevent a massive cold star from collapsing under its own gravity until it reached a singularity of infinite density
518,I realised that similar arguments could be applied to the expansion of the universe
519,A eureka moment came in  a few days after the birth of my daughter Lucy
520,Moreover if two black holes collide and merge to form a single black hole the area of the event horizon around the resulting black hole is greater than the sum of the areas of the event horizons around the original black holes
521,In fact we were so successful with the classical general theory of relativity that I was at a bit of a loose end in  after the publication with George Ellis of our book  The Large Scale Structure of SpaceTime
522,I was expecting that part of an incident wave would beabsorbed and the remainder scattered
523,But to my great surprise I found there seemed to be emission from the black hole itself
524,At first I thought this must be a mistake in my calculation
525,The emission of this thermal radiation from the black hole is now called Hawking radiation and Im proud to have discovered it
526,In  I was elected a fellow of the Royal Society
527,This election came as a surprise to members of my department because I was young and only a lowly research assistant
528,But within three years I had been promoted to professor
529,My work on black holes had given me hope that we would discover a theory of everything and that quest for an answer drove me on
530,In the same year my friend Kip Thorne invited me and my young family and a number of others working in general relativity to the California Institute of Technology Caltech
531,It gave me a considerable degree of independence especially as in the United States buildings and sidewalks are much more accessible for the disabled than they are in Britain
532,Everything seemed so parochial and restricted in Britain compared to the cando attitude in America
533,At the time the landscape was littered with dead trees killed by Dutch elm disease and the country was beset bystrikes
534,I also spent time working with Jim Hartle formulating a theory of the universes birth that we called no boundary
535,By the early s my health continued to worsen and I endured prolonged choking fits because my larynx was weakening and was letting food into my lungs as I ate
536,In  I caught pneumonia on a trip to CERN the European Organisation for Nuclear Research in Switzerland
537,I was rushed to the Lucerne Cantonal Hospital and put on to a ventilator
538,But Jane refused and had me flown back to Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge by air ambulance
539,As most of you will know a tracheostomy takes away the ability to speak
540,If it is slurred as mine was people can think you are mentally deficient and treat you accordingly
541,Luckily a computer expert in California named Walt Woltosz heard of my difficulties
542,He sent me a computer program he had written called Equalizer
543,I can claim to be the most connected person in the world
544,I first had the idea of writing a popular book about the universe in  around the time of my noboundary work
545,Appropriately enough  A Brief History of Time  was first published on April Fools Day in
546,Indeed the book was originally meant to be called  From the Big Bang to Black Holes A Short History of Time
547,The title was shortened and changed to brief and the rest is history
548,I never expected  A Brief History of Time  to do as well as it has
549,Not everyone may have finished it or understood everything they read but they at least grappled with one of the big questions of our existence and got the idea that we live in a universe governed by rational laws that through science we can discover and understand
550,To my colleagues Im just another physicist but to the wider public I became possibly the bestknown scientist in the world
551,This is partly because scientists apart from Einstein are not widely known rock stars and partly because I fit the stereotype of a disabled genius
552,I cant disguise myself with a wig and dark glassesthe wheelchair gives me away
553,Being well known and easily recognisable has its pluses and minuses but the minuses are more than outweighed by the pluses
554,I have led an extraordinary life on this planet while at the same time travelling across the universe by using my mind and the laws of physics
555,I have been to the furthest reaches of our galaxy travelled into a black hole and gone back to the beginning of time
556,On Earth I have experienced highs and lows turbulence and peace success and suffering
557,I have been rich and poor I have been ablebodied and disabled
558,I have been enormously privileged through my work in being able to contribute to our understanding of the universe
559,Without them the wonder of it all would be lost on me
560,I want to share my excitement about these big questions and my enthusiasm about this quest
561,One day I hope we will know the answers to all these questions
562,Let us fight for every woman and every man to have the opportunity to live healthy secure lives full of opportunity and love
563,We are all time travellers journeying together into the future
564,But let us work together to make that future a place we want to visit
565,My work was untidy and my handwriting not very good
566,And we talked about everything and specifically the origin of the universe
567,IS THERE A GODS cience is increasingly answering questions that used to be the province of religion
568,The world was a scary place so even people as tough as the Vikings believed in supernatural beings to make sense of natural phenomena like lightning storms or eclipses
569,Nowadays science provides better and more consistent answers but people will always cling to religion because it gives comfort and they do not trust or understand science
570,I do not want to give the impression that my work is about proving or disproving the existence of God
571,My work is about finding a rational framework to understand the universe around us
572,For centuries it was believed that disabled people like me were living under a curse that was inflicted by God
573,Well I suppose its possible that Ive upset someone up there but I prefer to think that everything can be explained another way by the laws of nature
574,If you believe in science like I do you believe that there are certain laws that are always obeyed
575,If you like you can say the laws are the work of God but that is more a definition of God than a proof of his existence
576,In about   BCE  a philosopher called Aristarchus was fascinated by eclipses especiallyeclipses of the Moon
577,He was brave enough to question whether they really were caused by gods
578,He studied the heavens carefully and reached a bold conclusion he realised the eclipse was really the shadow of the Earth passing over the Moon and not a divine event
579,He deduced that the Earth was not the centre of the universe as everyone had thought but that it instead orbits the Sun
580,He suggested that stars were not chinks in the floor of heaven as his contemporaries believed but that stars were other suns like ours only a very long way away
581,The universe is a machine governed by principles or lawslaws that can be understood by the human mind
582,I believe that the discovery of these laws has been humankinds greatest achievement for its these laws of natureas we now call them that will tell us whether we need a god to explain the universe at all
583,And there are many other laws at work here too
584,They apply not just to the flight of a ball but to the motion of a planet and everything else in the universe
585,One could define God as the embodiment of the laws of nature
586,I use the word God in an impersonal sense like Einstein did for the laws of nature so knowing the mind of God is knowing the laws of nature
587,My prediction is that we will know the mind of God by the end of this century
588,I published a book that asked if God created the universe and that caused something of a stir
589,People got upset that a scientist should have anything to say on the matter of religion
590,I think the universe was spontaneously created out of nothing according to the laws of science
591,The laws of science determine the evolution of the universe given its state at one time
592,These laws may or may not have been decreed by God but he cannot intervene to break the laws or they would not be laws
593,That leaves God with the freedom to choose the initial state of the universe but even here it seems there may be laws
594,Despite the complexity and variety of the universe it turns out that to make one you need just three ingredients
595,Lets imagine that we could list them in some kind of cosmic cookbook
596,Matter is all around us in the ground beneath our feet and out in space
597,Vast clouds of gas massive spirals of stars each containing billions of suns stretching away for incredible distances
598,Look up at the Sun and you can feel it on your face energy produced by a star ninetythree million miles away
599,Energy permeates the universe driving the processes that keep it a dynamic endlessly changing place
600,The third thing we need to build a universe is space
601,You can call the universe many thingsawesome beautiful violentbut one thing you cant call it is cramped
602,Einstein realised something quite extraordinary that two of the main ingredients needed to make a universemass and energyare basically the same thing two sides of the same coin if you like
603,His famous equation E  mc   simply means that mass can be thought of as a kind of energy and vice versa
604,So instead of three ingredients we can now say that the universe has just two energy and space
605,At the moment of the Big Bang an entire universe came into existence and with it space
606,It all inflated just like a balloon being blown up
607,At the risk of getting myself into trouble I think we can understand much more the natural phenomena that terrified the Vikings
608,We can even go beyond the beautiful symmetry of energy and matter discovered by Einstein
609,We can use the laws of nature to address the very origins of the universe and discover if the existence of God is the only way to explain it
610,As I was growing up in England after the Second World War it was a time of austerity
611,We were told that you never get something for nothing
612,The secret lies in one of the strangest facts about our cosmos
613,The laws of physics demand the existence of something called negative energy
614,To help you get your head around this weird but crucial concept let me draw on a simple analogy
615,Imagine a man wants to build a hill on a flat piece of land
616,To make this hill he digs a hole in the ground and uses that soil to dig his hill
617,But of course hes not just making a hillhes also making a hole in effect a negative version of the hill
618,The stuff that was in the hole has now become the hill so it all perfectly balances out
619,In this way the positive and the negative add up to zero always
620,This may sound odd but according to the laws of nature concerning gravity and motionlaws that are among the oldest in sciencespace itself is a vast store of negative energy
621,Ill admit that unless mathematics is your thing this is hard to grasp but its true
622,The endless web of billions upon billions of galaxies each pulling on each other by the force of gravity acts like a giant storage device
623,The universe is like an enormous battery storing negative energy
624,The positive side of thingsthe mass and energy we see todayis like the hill
625,The corresponding hole or negative side of things is spread throughout space
626,You have to make it out of other stuff like coffee beans water and perhaps some milk and sugar
627,Thats because at this scale particles such as protons behave according to the laws of nature we call quantum mechanics
628,Since we know the universe itself was once very smallperhaps smaller than a protonthis means something quite remarkable
629,It means the universe itself in all its mindboggling vastness and complexity could simply have popped into existence without violating the known laws of nature
630,From that moment on vast amounts of energy were released as space itself expandeda place to store all the negative energy needed to balance the books
631,But of course the critical question is raised again did God create the quantum laws that allowed the Big Bang to occur In a nutshell do we need a God to set it up so that the Big Bang could bang I have no desire to offend anyone of faith but I think science has a more compelling explanation than a divine creator
632,Our everyday experience makes us think that everything that happens must be caused by something that occurred earlier in time so its natural for us to think that somethingmaybe Godmust have caused the universe to come into existence
633,The laws of nature itself tell us that not only could the universe have popped into existence without any assistance like a proton and have required nothing in terms of energy but also that it is possible thatnothing caused the Big Bang
634,Something very wonderful happened to time at the instant of the Big Bang
635,To understand this mindboggling idea consider a black hole floating in space
636,A typical black hole is a star so massive that it has collapsed in on itself
637,Its gravitational pull is so powerful it warps and distorts not only light but also time
638,As the clock gets closer and closer to the black hole it begins to get slower and slower
639,Now imagine the clock as it enters the black holewell assuming of course that it could withstand the extreme gravitational forcesit would actually stop
640,It stops not because it is broken but because inside the black hole time itself doesnt exist
641,In the last hundred years we have made spectacular advances in our understanding of the universe
642,And just as with modernday black holes floating around in space the laws of nature dictate something quite extraordinary
643,They tell us that here too time itself must come to a stop
644,You cant get to a time before the Big Bang because there was no time before the Big Bang
645,We have finally found something that doesnt have a cause because there was no time for a cause to exist in
646,For me this means that there is no possibility of a creator because there is no time for a creator to have existed in
647,They dont expect the answers to be easy so they are prepared to struggle a bit
648,Time didnt exist before the Big Bang so there is no time for God to make the universe in
649,Its like asking for directions to the edge of the Earththe Earth is a sphere that doesnt have an edge so looking for it is a futile exercise
650,No one created the universe and no one directs our fate
651,This leads me to a profound realisation there is probably no heaven and afterlife either
652,I think belief in an afterlife is just wishful thinking
653,There is no reliable evidence for it and it flies in the face of everything we know in science
654,We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe and for that I am extremely grateful
655,If you like you can call the laws of science God but it wouldnt be a personal God that you would meet and put questions to
656,Prometheus punishment was being chained to a rock for eternity although happily he was eventually liberated by Hercules
657,We have already made remarkable progress in understanding the cosmos
658,I like to think we may not be far off
659,According to the Boshongo people of central Africa in the beginning there was only darkness water and the great god Bumba
660,One day Bumba in pain from stomach ache vomited up the Sun
661,The Sun dried up some of the water leaving land
662,Still in pain Bumba vomited up the Moon the stars and then some animalsthe leopard the crocodile the turtle and finally man
663,These creation myths like many others try to answer the questions we all ask
664,So it cant have been around that long or it would have progressed even more
665,For example according to Bishop Ussher the Book of Genesis placed the beginning of time on October    BCE  at  p
666,On the other hand the physical surroundings like mountains and rivers change very little in a human lifetime
667,They were therefore thought to be a constant background and either to have existed for ever as an empty landscape or to have been created at the same time as the humans
668,For example Aristotle the most famous of the Greek philosophers believed that the universe had existed for ever
669,He suggested the reason we see progress was that floods or other natural disasters had repeatedly set civilisation back to the beginning
670,The motivation for believing in an eternal universe was the desire to avoid invoking divine intervention to create the universe and set it going
671,He felt there were logical contradictions or antimonies either way
672,Both the thesis and the antithesis depended on Kants assumption along with almost everyone else that time was absolute
673,That is to say it went from the infinite past to the infinite future independently of any universe that might or might not exist
674,This is still the picture in the mind of many scientists today
675,In this space and time were no longer absolute no longer a fixed background to events
676,Instead they were dynamical quantities that were shaped by the matter and energy in the universe
677,They were defined onlywithin the universe so it made no sense to talk of a time before the universe began
678,It would be like asking for a point south of the South Pole
679,Although Einsteins theory unified time and space it didnt tell us much about space itself
680,Something that seems obvious about space is that it goes on and on and on
681,But modern instruments like the Hubble space telescope allow us to probe deep into space
682,There are giant elliptical galaxies and spiral galaxies like our own
683,Our own galaxy blocks our view in certain directions but apart from that the galaxies are distributed roughly uniformly throughout space with some local concentrations and voids
684,The density of galaxies appears to drop off at very large distances but that seems to be because they are so far away and faint that we cant make them out
685,Although the universe seems to be much the same at each position in space it is definitely changing in time
686,This was not realised until the early years of the last century
687,Up to then it was thought the universe was essentially constant in time
688,It might have existed for an infinite time but that seemed to lead to absurd conclusions
689,If stars had been radiating for an infinite time they would have heated up the universe until it reached their own temperature
690,So the observation that we have all made that the sky at night is dark is very important
691,It implies that the universe cannot have existed for ever in the state we see today
692,Something must have happened in the past to make the stars turn on a finite time ago
693,Then the light from very distant stars wouldnt have had time to reach us yet
694,But for most people it wasconsistent with the idea that the universe had been created much as it is now only a few thousand years ago just as Bishop Ussher had concluded
695,First of all Edwin Hubble discovered that many faint patches of light called nebulae were in fact other galaxies vast collections of stars like our Sun but at a great distance
696,In order for them to appear so small and faint the distances had to be so great that light from them would have taken millions or even billions of years to reach us
697,This indicated that the beginning of the universe couldnt have been just a few thousand years ago
698,But the second thing Hubble discovered was even more remarkable
699,By an analysis of the light from other galaxies Hubble was able to measure whether they were moving towards us or away
700,To his great surprise he found they were nearly all moving away
701,Moreover the further they were from us the faster they were moving away
702,The discovery of the expansion of the universe was one of the great intellectual revolutions of the twentieth century
703,It came as a total surprise and it completely changed the discussion of the origin of the universe
704,If the galaxies are moving apart they must have been closer together in the past
705,From the present rate of expansion we can estimate that they must have been very close together indeed about  to  billion years ago
706,So it looks as though the universe might have started then with everything being at the same point in space
707,But many scientists were unhappy with the universe having a beginning because it seemed to imply that physics broke down
708,One of these was the steadystate theory proposed by Hermann Bondi Thomas Gold and Fred Hoyle in
709,In the steadystate theory as galaxies moved apart the idea was that new galaxies would form from matter that was supposed to be continually being created throughout space
710,The universe would have existed for ever and would have looked the same at all times
711,This last property hadthe great virtue of being a definite prediction that could be tested by observation
712,The Cambridge radio astronomy group under Martin Ryle did a survey of weak sources of radio waves in the early s
713,These were distributed fairly uniformly across the sky indicating that most of the sources lay outside our galaxy
714,The steadystate theory predicted a relationship between the number of sources and their strength
715,This was contrary to the basic assumption of the steadystate theory that everything was constant in time
716,For this and other reasons the steadystate theory was abandoned
717,Another attempt to avoid the universe having a beginning was the suggestion that there was a previous contracting phase but because of rotation and local irregularities the matter would not all fall to the same point
718,Instead different parts of the matter would miss each other and the universe would expand again with the density always remaining finite
719,Two Russians Evgeny Lifshitz and Isaak Khalatnikov actually claimed to have proved that a general contraction without exact symmetry would always lead to a bounce with the density remaining finite
720,This result was very convenient for MarxistLeninist dialectical materialism because it avoided awkward questions about the creation of the universe
721,It therefore became an article of faith for Soviet scientists
722,I began my research in cosmology just about the time that Lifshitz and Khalatnikov published their conclusion that the universe didnt have a beginning
723,I realised that this was a very important question but I wasnt convinced by the arguments that Lifshitz and Khalatnikov had used
724,There is a chain of causality stretching back into the past
725,But suppose this chain has a beginning suppose there was a first event
726,They tried to avoid it either by claiming like the Russians and the steadystate theorists that the universe didnt have a beginning or by maintaining that the origin of the universe did not lie within the realm of science but belonged to metaphysics or religion
727,In my opinion this is not a position any true scientist shouldtake
728,If the laws of science are suspended at the beginning of the universe might not they also fail at other times A law is not a law if it only holds sometimes
729,I believe that we should try to understand the beginning of the universe on the basis of science
730,It may be a task beyond our powers but at least we should make the attempt
731,It is difficult to argue with a mathematical theorem so in the end Lifshitz and Khalatnikov conceded that the universe should have a beginning
732,Although the idea of a beginning to the universe might not be very welcome to communist ideas ideology was never allowed to stand in the way of science in physics
733,Physics was needed for the bomb and it was important that it worked
734,At this point Einsteins general theory of relativity would have broken down
735,One is left with the origin of the universe apparently being beyond the scope of science
736,Observational evidence to confirm the idea that the universe had a very dense beginning came in October  a few months after my first singularity result with the discovery of a faint background of microwaves throughout space
737,These microwaves are the same as those in your microwave oven but very much less powerful
738,degrees Fahrenheit not much good for defrosting the pizza let alone cooking it
739,If you ever set your television to an empty channel a few per cent of the snow you saw on the screen was caused by this background of microwaves
740,The only reasonable interpretation of the background is that it is radiation left over from an early very hot and dense state
741,As theuniverse expanded the radiation would have cooled until it is just the faint remnant we observe today
742,That the universe began with a singularity was not an idea that I or a number of other people were happy with
743,It can be summed up in the Uncertainty Principle that was proposed in  by the German scientist Werner Heisenberg
744,One cannot accurately predict both the position and the speed of a particle
745,The more accurately the position is predicted the less accurately you will be able to predict the speed and vice versa
746,Einstein objected strongly to the idea that the universe is governed by chance
747,His feelings were summed up in his dictum God does not play dice
748,But all the evidence is that God is quite a gambler
749,The universe is like a giant casino with dice being rolled or wheels being spun on every occasion
750,A casino owner risks losing money each time dice are thrown or the roulette wheel is spun
751,But over a large number of bets the odds average out and the casino owner makes sure they average out in his or her favour
752,The only chance you have of winning against them is to stake all your money on a few rolls of the dice or spins of the wheel
753,In order to understand the origin of the universe one therefore has to incorporate the Uncertainty Principle into Einsteins general theory of relativity
754,This has been the great challenge in theoretical physics for at least the last thirty years
755,Wehavent solved it yet but we have made a lot of progress
756,Because we only know some combination of position and speed of a particle we cannot make precise predictions about the future positions and speeds of particles
757,We can only assign a probability to particular combinations of positions and speeds
758,Thus there is a certain probability to a particular future of the universe
759,But now suppose we try to understand the past in the same way
760,Given the nature of the observations we can make now all we can do is assign a probability to a particular history of the universe
761,Thus the universe must have many possible histories each with its own probability
762,This idea that the universe has multiple histories may sound like science fiction but it is now accepted as science fact
763,So we presume it works to retrodict the past too
764,Scientists are now working to combine Einsteins general theory of relativity and Feynmans idea of multiple histories into a complete unified theory that will describe everything that happens in the universe
765,But if the frontier of the universe was just at a normal point of space and time we could go past it and claim the territory beyond as part of the universe
766,It seems there is no logical basis for picking one set of boundary conditions over another
767,Maybe the universe has no boundary in space and time
768,At first sight this seems to be in direct contradiction to the geometrical theorems that I mentioned earlier
769,It isnt anything to do with the real time that we experience
770,It is a mathematical trick to make the calculations work and it replaces the real time we experience
771,Our idea was to say that there was no boundary in imaginary time
772,If the boundary condition of the universe is that it has no boundary in imaginary time it wont have just a single history
773,There are many histories in imaginary time and each of them will determine a history in real time
774,Thus we have a superabundance of histories for the universe
775,It may be that intelligent beings can evolve without galaxies and stars but it seems unlikely
776,It implies it is one of the minority of histories that have galaxies and stars
777,The Anthropic Principle says that the universe has to be more or less as we see it because if it were different there wouldnt be anyone here to observe it
778,Many scientists dislike the Anthropic Principle because it seems little more than hand waving and not to have much predictive power
779,Most of these histories are quite unsuitable for the development of intelligent life
780,Either they are empty or too short lasting or too highly curved or wrong in some otherway
781,Yet according to Richard Feynmans multiplehistories idea these uninhabited histories might have quite a high probability
782,The human race does not have a very good record of intelligent behaviour
783,As an example of the power of the Anthropic Principle consider the number of directions in space
784,It is a matter of common experience that we live in threedimensional space
785,That is to say we can represent the position of a point in space by three numbers
786,If it had a gut that went right through like we have it would divide the animal in two and the poor creature would fall apart
787,So two flat directions are not enough for anything as complicated as intelligent life
788,In three dimensions planets can have stable orbits around stars
789,This is a consequence of gravitation obeying the inverse square law as discovered by Robert Hooke in  and elaborated on by Isaac Newton
790,Think about the gravitational attraction of two bodies at a particular distance
791,If that distance is doubled then the force between them is divided by four
792,If the distance is tripled then the force is divided by nine if quadrupled then the force is divided by sixteen and so on
793,If the distance between two bodies is doubled then the gravitational force would be divided by eight tripled by twentyseven and if quadrupled by sixtyfour
794,This change to an inverse cube law prevents planets from having stable orbits around their suns
795,They would either fall into their sun or escape to the outer darkness and cold
796,Similarly the orbits of electrons in atoms would not be stable so matter as we know it would not exist
797,Thus although the multiple histories idea would allow any number of nearly flat directions only histories with three flat directions will contain intelligent beings
798,The differences between different directions is about one part in
799,The generally accepted explanation for this smoothness is that very early in the history of the universe it underwent a period of very rapid expansion by a factor of at least a billion billion billion
800,This process is known as inflation something that was good for the universe in contrast to inflation of prices that too often plagues us
801,If that was all there was to it the microwave radiation would be totally the same in all directions
802,Quantum fluctuations occur as a consequence of the Uncertainty Principle
803,Furthermore these fluctuations were the seeds for structures in our universe galaxies stars and us
804,We held a workshop in Cambridge that summer attended by all the major players in the field
805,This was ten years before fluctuations in the microwave sky were discovered by the COBE satellite in  so theory was way ahead of experiment
806,Cosmology became a precision science another ten years later in  with the first results from the WMAP satellite
807,WMAP produced a wonderful map of the temperature of the cosmic microwave sky a snapshot of the universe at about onehundredth of its present age
808,The irregularities you see are predicted by inflation and they mean that some regions of the universe had a slightly higher density than others
809,The gravitational attraction of the extra density slows the expansion of that region and can eventually cause it to collapse to form galaxies and stars
810,So look carefully at the map of the microwave sky
811,It is the blueprint for all the structure in the universe
812,We are the product of quantum fluctuations in the very early universe
813,Superseding WMAP today there is the Planck satellite with a much higherresolution map of the universe
814,Planck is testing our theories in earnest and may even detect the imprint of gravitational waves predicted by inflation
815,Mtheory predicts that a great many universes were created out of nothing corresponding to the many different possible histories
816,Each universe has many possible histories and many possible states as they age to the present and beyond into the future
817,Most of these states will be quite unlike the universe we observe
818,There is still hope that we see the first evidence for Mtheory at the LHC particle accelerator the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Geneva
819,From an Mtheory perspective it only probes low energies but we might be lucky and see a weaker signal of fundamental theory such as supersymmetry
820,I think the discovery of supersymmetric partners for the known particles would revolutionise our understanding of the universe
821,In  the discovery of the Higgs particle by the LHC at CERN in Geneva was announced
822,This was the first discovery of a new elementary particle in the twentyfirst century
823,There is still some hope that the LHC will discover supersymmetry
824,But even if the LHC does not discover any new elementary particles supersymmetry might still be found in the next generation of accelerators that are presently being planned
825,The beginning of the universe itself in the Hot Big Bang is the ultimatehighenergy laboratory for testing Mtheory and our ideas about the building blocks of spacetime and matter
826,Different theories leave behind different fingerprints in the current structure of the universe so astrophysical data can give us clues about the unification of all the forces of nature
827,So there may well be other universes but unfortunately we will never be able to explore them
828,We have seen something about the origin of the universe
829,They depend on the amount of matter in the universe
830,If there is more than a certain critical amount the gravitational attraction between the galaxies will slow down the expansion
831,Eventually they will then start falling towards each other and will all come together in a Big Crunch
832,That will be the end of the history of the universe in real time
833,In Britain people dont seem too worried about a possible end twenty billion years in the future
834,You can do quite a lot of eating drinking and being merry before that
835,If the density of the universe is below the critical value gravity is too weak to stop the galaxies flying apart for ever
836,All the stars will burn out and the universe will get emptier and emptier and colder and colder
837,So again things will come to an end but in a less dramatic way
838,In this answer I have tried to explain something of the origins future and nature of our universe
839,Yet this nut encodes everything that happens in real time
840,We could be bounded in a nutshell and count ourselves kings of infinite space
841,IS THERE OTHER INTELLIGENT LIFE IN THE UNIVERSEI  would like to speculate a little on the development of life in the universe and in particular on the development of intelligent life
842,I shall take this to include the human race even though much of its behaviour throughout history has been pretty stupid and not calculated to aid the survival of the species
843,This observation even has its own law the so called second law of thermodynamics
844,This law says that the total amount of disorder or entropy in the universe always increases with time
845,The order in one body can increase provided that the amount of  dis order in its surroundings increases by a greater amount
846,We can define life as an ordered system that can keep itself going against the tendency to disorder and can reproduce itself
847,That is it can make similar but independent ordered systems
848,To do these things the system must convert energy in some ordered formlike food sunlight or electric powerinto disordered energy in the form of heat
849,In this way the system can satisfy the requirement that the total amount of disorder increases while at the same time increasing the order in itself and its offspring
850,In biology these two parts are called genes and metabolism
851,But it is worth emphasising that there need be nothing biological about them
852,For example a computer virus is a program that will make copies of itself in the memory of a computer and will transfer itself to other computers
853,Thus it fits the definition of a living system that I have given
854,Like a biological virus it is a rather degenerate form because it contains only instructions or genes and doesnt have any metabolism of its own
855,Instead it reprograms the metabolism of the host computer or cell
856,Some people have questioned whether viruses should count as life because they are parasites and cannot exist independently of their hosts
857,But then most forms of life ourselves included are parasites in that they feed off and depend for their survival on other forms of life
858,Maybe it says something about human nature that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive
859,I shall return to electronic forms of life later on
860,One can speculate that one might have life with some other chemical basis such as silicon but carbon seems the most favourable case because it has the richest chemistry
861,That carbon atoms should exist at all with the properties that they have requires a fine adjustment of physical constants such as the QCD scale the electric charge and even the dimension of spacetime
862,If these constants had significantly different values either the nucleus of the carbon atom would not be stable or the electrons would collapse in on the nucleus
863,At first sight it seems remarkable that the universe is so finely tuned
864,Maybe this is evidence that the universe was specially designed to produce the human race
865,One can apply the Anthropic Principle in either its Strong or Weak versions
866,For the Strong Anthropic Principle one supposes that there are many different universes each with differentvalues of the physical constants
867,Since we must live in one of these universes we should not be surprised that the physical constants are finely tuned
868,That is I shall take the values of the physical constants as given
869,It was so hot that all the matter would have been in the form of particles called protons and neutrons
870,There would initially have been equal numbers of protons and neutrons
871,About a minute after the Big Bang the temperature would have fallen to about a billion degrees about a hundred times the temperature in the Sun
872,At this temperature neutrons start to decay into more protons
873,But no heavier elements like carbon or oxygen would have been formed in the early universe
874,It is difficult to imagine that one could build a living system out of just hydrogen and heliumand anyway the early universe was still far too hot for atoms to combine into molecules
875,But some regions had slightly higher densities than others and the gravitational attraction of the extra matter in those regions slowed down their expansion and eventually stopped it
876,Instead they collapsed to form galaxies and stars starting from about two billion years after the Big Bang
877,Some of the early stars would have been more massive than our Sun they would have been hotter than the Sun and would have burned the original hydrogen and helium into heavier elements such as carbon oxygen and iron
878,After that some of the stars exploded as supernovae and scattered the heavy elements back into space to form the raw material for later generations of stars
879,Other stars are too far away for us to be able to see directly if they have planets going round them
880,The first is to look at the star and see if the amount of light coming from it is constant
881,If a planet moves in front of the star the light from the star will be slightly obscured
882,If this happens regularly it is because a planets orbit is taking it in front of the star repeatedly
883,A second method is to measure the position of the star accurately
884,If a planet is orbiting the star it will induce a small wobble in the position of the star
885,This can be observed and again if it is a regular wobble then one deduces that it is due to a planet in orbit around the star
886,These methods were first applied about twenty years ago and by now a few thousand planets have been discovered orbiting distant stars
887,It is estimated that one star in five has an Earthlike planet orbiting it at a distance from the star to be compatible with life as we know it
888,Our own solar system was formed about four and a half billion years ago or a little more than nine billion years after the Big Bang from gas contaminated with the remains of earlier stars
889,The Earth was formed largely out of the heavier elements including carbon and oxygen
890,This has the famous doublehelix form discovered in the s by Francis Crick and James Watson in a hut on the New Museum site in Cambridge
891,Linking the two chains in the helix are pairs of nitrogenous bases
892,There are four types of nitrogenous basesadenine cytosine guanine and thymine
893,An adenine on one chain is always matched with a thymine on the other chain and a guanine with a cytosine
894,Thus the sequence of nitrogenous bases on one chain defines a unique complementary sequence on the other chain
895,The two chains can then separate and each acts as a template to build further chains
896,Thus DNA molecules can reproduce the genetic information coded in their sequences of nitrogenous bases
897,If the appearance of life on a given planet was very unlikely one might have expected it to take a long time
898,More precisely one might have expected life to appear as late as possible while still allowing time for the subsequent evolution to intelligent beings like us before the Sun swells up and engulfs the Earth
899,In that time an intelligent form of life could conceivably master space travel and be able to escape to another star
900,But if no escape is possible life on Earth would be doomed
901,There is fossil evidence that there was some form of life on Earth about three and a half billion years ago
902,This may have been only  million years after the Earth became stable and cool enough for life to develop
903,Once DNA appeared it would have been so successful that it might have completely replaced the earlier forms
904,RNA is like DNA but rather simpler and without the doublehelix structure
905,Short lengths of RNA could reproduce themselves like DNA and might eventually build up to DNA
906,We cannot make these nucleic acids in the laboratory from nonliving material
907,But given  million years and oceans covering most of the Earth there might be a reasonable probability of RNA being made by chance
908,Some would have been neutralthey would not have affected the function of the gene
909,And a few errors would have been favourable to the survival of the species these would have been chosen by Darwinian natural selection
910,The process of biological evolution was very slow at first
911,It took about two and a half billion years before the earliest cells evolved into multi cellular organisms
912,But it took less than another billion years for some of these to evolve into fish and for some of the fish in turn to evolve into mammals
913,It took only about a hundred million years to develop from the early mammals to us
914,The reason is that the early mammals already contained their versions of the essential organs we have
915,All that was required to evolve from early mammals to humans was a bit of finetuning
916,But with the human race evolution reached a critical stage comparable in importance with the development of DNA
917,This was the development of language and particularly written language
918,It meant that information could be passed on from generation to generation other than genetically through DNA
919,There has been some detectable change in human DNA brought about by biological evolution in the  years of recorded history but the amount of knowledge handed on from generation to generation has grown enormously
920,The DNA in a human egg or sperm contains about three billion base pairs of nitrogenous bases
921,So the total amount of useful information in our genes is probably something like a hundred million bits
922,One bit of information is the answer to a yesno question
923,By contrast a paperback novel might contain two million bits of information
924,Therefore a human is equivalent to about fifty  Harry Potter books and a major national library can contain about five million books or about ten trillion bits
925,The amount of information handed down in books or via the internet is  times as much as there is in DNA
926,Even more important is the fact that the information in books can be changed and updated much more rapidly
927,It has taken us several millionyears to evolve from less advanced earlier apes
928,During that time the useful information in our DNA has probably changed by only a few million bits so the rate of biological evolution in humans is about a bit a year
929,By contrast there are about  new books published in the English language each year containing of the order of a hundred billion bits of information
930,Of course the great majority of this information is garbage and no use to any form of life
931,This means that we have entered a new phase of evolution
932,But the external  recordin books and other longlasting forms of storagehas grown enormously
933,Some people would use the term evolution only for the internally transmitted genetic material and would object to it being applied to information handed down externally
934,We may be no stronger or inherently more intelligent than our caveman ancestors
935,I think it is legitimate to take a broader view and include externally transmitted information as well as DNA in the evolution of the human race
936,The timescale for evolution in the external transmission period is the timescale for accumulation of information
937,This used to be hundreds or even thousands of years
938,But now this timescale has shrunk to about fifty years or less
939,But nowadays if you read one book a day it would take you many tens of thousands of years to read through the books in a national library
940,This has meant that no one person can be the master of more than a small corner of human knowledge
941,This is likely to be a major limitation in the future
942,We certainly cannot continue for long with the exponential rate of growth of knowledge that we have had in the last  years
943,An even greater limitation and danger for future generations is that we still have the instincts and in particular the aggressive impulses that we had in caveman days
944,Aggression in the form of subjugating or killing other men and taking their women and food has had definite survival advantage up to the present time
945,But now it could destroy the entire human race and much of the rest of life on Earth
946,A nuclear war is still the most immediate danger but there are others such as the release of a genetically engineered virus
947,There is no time to wait for Darwinian evolution to make us more intelligent and better natured
948,Other qualities such as intelligence are probably controlled by a large number of genes and it will be much more difficult to find them and work out the relations between them
949,Laws will probably be passed against genetic engineering with humans
950,But some people wont be able to resist the temptation to improve human characteristics such as size of memory resistance to disease and length of life
951,If the human race manages to redesign itself to reduce or eliminate the risk of selfdestruction it will probably spread out and colonise otherplanets and stars
952,The natural lifetime for such beings is short compared with the travel time
953,According to the theory of relativity nothing can travel faster than light so a round trip from us to the nearest star would take at least eight years and to the centre of the galaxy about  years
954,In science fiction they overcome this difficulty by space warps or travel through extra dimensions
955,In the theory of relativity if one can travel faster than light one can also travel back in time and this would lead to problems with people going back and changing the past
956,One would also expect to have already seen large numbers of tourists from the future curious to look at our quaint oldfashioned ways
957,It might be possible to use genetic engineering to make DNAbased life survive indefinitely or at least for  years
958,These could be designed to last long enough for interstellar travel
959,These machines would be a new form of life based on mechanical and electronic components rather than macromolecules
960,They could eventually replace DNAbased life just as DNA may have replaced an earlier form of life
961,Another possibility is that there was a reasonable probability of forming self reproducing systems like cells but that most of these forms of life did not evolve intelligence
962,It is more likely that evolution is a random process with intelligence as only one of a large number of possible outcomes
963,It is not even clear that intelligence has any longterm survival value
964,Bacteria and other singlecell organisms may live on if all other life on Earth is wiped out by our actions
965,This is a good fraction of the total time available before the Sun blows up so it would be consistent with the hypothesis that the probability for life to develop intelligence is low
966,In this case we might expect to find many other life forms in the galaxy but we are unlikely to find intelligent life
967,In  we observed the collision of a comet ShoemakerLevy with Jupiter
968,It is thought the collision of a rather smaller body with the Earth about sixtysix million years ago was responsible for the extinction of the dinosaurs
969,A few small early mammals survived but anything as large as a human would have almost certainly been wiped out
970,If this figure is correct it would mean that intelligent life on Earth has developed only because of the lucky chance that there have been no major collisions in the last sixtysix million years
971,A third possibility is that there is a reasonable probability for life toform and to evolve to intelligent beings but the system becomes unstable and the intelligent life destroys itself
972,This would be a very pessimistic conclusion and I very much hope it isnt true
973,I prefer a fourth possibility that there are other forms of intelligent life out there but that we have been overlooked
974,In  I was involved in the launch of the Breakthrough Listen Initiatives
975,Breakthrough Listen uses radio observations to search for intelligent extraterrestrial life and has stateoftheart facilities generous funding and thousands of hours of dedicated radio telescope time
976,It is the largest ever scientific research programme aimed at finding evidence of civilisations beyond Earth
977,Breakthrough Message is an international competition to create messages that could be read by an advanced civilisation
978,But we need to be wary of answering back until we have developed a bit further
979,Meeting a more advanced civilisation at our present stage might be a bit like the original inhabitants of America meeting Columbusand I dont think they thought they were better off for it
980,And I think we wouldve known if we had been visited it would be like the film  Independence Day
981,CAN WE PREDICT THE FUTUREI n ancient times the world must have seemed pretty arbitrary
982,Disasters such as floods plagues earthquakes or volcanoes must have seemed to happen without warning or apparent reason
983,Many people still partially subscribe to this belief and try to make a pact with fortune
984,They offer to behave better or be kinder if only they can get an Agrade for a course or pass their driving test
985,These regularities were most obvious in the motion of the heavenly bodies across the sky
986,It was put on a firm mathematical basis by Newton more than  years ago and we still use his theory of gravity to predict the motion of almost all celestial bodies
987,Following the example of astronomy it was found that other natural phenomena also obeyed definite scientific laws
988,I would like to quote to you Laplaces actual words but Laplace was rather like Proust in that he wrote sentences of inordinate length and complexity
989,I dont think that Laplace was claiming that God didnt exist
990,It is just that God doesnt intervene to break the laws of science
991,The idea that the state of the universe at one time determines the state at all other times has been a central tenet of science ever since Laplaces time
992,It implies that we can predict the future in principle at least
993,A butterfly flapping its wings in Australia can cause rain in Central Park New York
994,Despite these practical difficulties scientific determinism remained the official dogma throughout the nineteenth century
995,This was put forward in  by the German physicist Max Planck as an ad hoc hypothesis to solve an outstanding paradox
996,According to the classical nineteenthcentury ideas dating back to Laplace a hot body like a piece of redhot metal should give off radiation
997,It would lose energy in radio waves the infrared visible light ultraviolet Xrays and gamma rays all at the same rate
998,It is a bit like saying that you cant buy sugar loose in the supermarket it has to be in kilogram bags
999,The energy in the packets or quanta is higher for ultraviolet and Xrays than for infrared or visible light
1000,It means thatunless a body is very hot like the Sun it will not have enough energy to give off even a single quantum of ultraviolet or Xrays
1001,For example it was found that elementary particles behaved rather like little tops spinning about an axis
1002,But the amount of spin couldnt have just any value
1003,It had to be some multiple of a basic unit
1004,Because this unit is very small one does not notice that a normal top really slows down in a rapid sequence of discrete steps rather than as a continuous process
1005,But for tops as small as atoms the discrete nature of spin is very important
1006,It was some time before people realised the implications of this quantum behaviour for determinism
1007,It was not until  that Werner Heisenberg another German physicist pointed out that you couldnt measure simultaneously both the position and speed of a particle exactly
1008,But by Plancks work one cant use an arbitrarily small amount of light
1009,This will disturb the particle and change its speed in a way that cant be predicted
1010,To measure the position of the particle accurately you will have to use light of short wavelength like ultraviolet Xrays or gamma rays
1011,But again by Plancks work quanta of these forms of light have higher energies than those of visible light
1012,So they will disturb the speed of the particle more
1013,It is a nowin situation the more accurately you try to measure the position of the particle the less accurately you can know the speed and vice versa
1014,This is summed up in the Uncertainty Principle that Heisenberg formulated the uncertainty in the position of a particle times the uncertainty in its speed is always greater than a quantity called Plancks constant divided by twice the mass of the particle
1015,Laplaces vision of scientific determinism involved knowing the positions and speeds of the particles in the universe at one instant of time
1016,Einstein was very unhappy about this apparent randomness in nature
1017,His views were summed up in his famous phrase God does not play dice
1018,This reality might be known to God but the quantum nature of light would prevent us seeing it except through a glass darkly
1019,Hidden variable theories might seem to be the most obvious way to incorporate the Uncertainty Principle into physics
1020,They form the basis of the mental picture of the universe held by many scientists and almost all philosophers of science
1021,The British physicist John Bell devised an experimental test that could falsify hidden variable theories
1022,Thus it seems that even God is bound by the Uncertainty Principle and cannot know both the position and the speed of a particle
1023,Other scientists were much more ready than Einstein to modify the classical nineteenthcentury view of determinism
1024,A new theory quantum mechanics was put forward by Heisenberg Erwin Schrdinger from Austria and the British physicist Paul Dirac
1025,Dirac was my predecessor but one as the Lucasian Professor in Cambridge
1026,Yet it should concern us all because it is completely different from the classical picture of the physical universe and of reality itself
1027,In quantum mechanics particles dont have welldefined positions and speeds
1028,The size of the wave function gives the probability that the particle will be found in that position
1029,One can have a wave function that is verystrongly peaked in a small region
1030,This will mean that the uncertainty in the position is small
1031,But the wave function will vary very rapidly near the peak up on one side and down on the other
1032,The wave function contains all that one can know of the particle both its position and its speed
1033,Thus one still has a kind of determinism but it is not the sort that Laplace envisaged
1034,Instead of being able to predict the positions and speeds of particles all we can predict is the wave function
1035,The problem arises because gravity can warp spacetime so much that there can be regions of space that we cant observe
1036,That means that we cannot even in principle observe the particles inside a black hole
1037,So we cannot measure their positions or velocities at all
1038,There is then an issue of whether this introduces further unpredictability beyond that found in quantum mechanics
1039,To sum up the classical view put forward by Laplace was that the future motion of particles was completely determined if one knew their positions and speeds at one time
1040,But perhaps even this limited predictability might disappear if black holes are taken into account
1041,In principle the laws allow us to predict the future
1042,Black holes are stranger than anything dreamed up by sciencefiction writers but they are firmly matters of science fact
1043,The first discussion of black holes was in  by a Cambridge man John Michell
1044,If one fires a particle such as a cannon ball vertically upwards it will be slowed down by gravity
1045,Eventually the particle will stop moving upwards and will fall back
1046,The  escape velocity is just over  kilometres per second for the Earth and about  kilometres per second for the Sun
1047,Both of these are much higher than the speed of real cannon balls
1048,Thus light can get away from the Earth or Sun without much difficulty
1049,We would not be able to see them because any light they sent out would be dragged back by gravity
1050,Although gravity is by far the weakest of the known forces of nature it has two crucial advantages over other forces
1051,The Earth is held in orbit by the Sun ninetythree million miles away and the Sun is held in orbit around the centre of the galaxy about  light years away
1052,These two features mean that for a sufficiently large star the gravitational attraction between particles can dominate over all other forces and lead to gravitational collapse
1053,Albert Einstein even wrote a paper in  claiming that stars could not collapse under gravity because matter could not be compressed beyond a certain point
1054,In his work in the s and s he emphasised that many stars would eventually collapse and explored the problems this posed for theoretical physics
1055,In some cases it may be able to support itself as a white dwarf star the dense remnants of a stellar core
1056,A similar maximum mass was calculated by the Russian physicist Lev Landau for a star made entirely of neutrons
1057,And that if one neglected pressure a uniform spherically systematic symmetric star would contract to a singlepoint of infinite density
1058,In fact it marks the end of space and time itself
1059,Most scientists including Robert Oppenheimer switched their attention to nuclear physics and the issue of gravitational collapse was largely forgotten
1060,Interest in the subject revived with the discovery of distant objects called quasars
1061,They were bright despite being at great distances from the Earth
1062,Nuclear processes could not account for their energy output because they release only a small fraction of their rest mass as pure energy
1063,The only alternative was gravitational energy released by gravitational collapse
1064,It was clear that a uniform spherical star would contract to a point of infinite density a singularity
1065,This means that at this point of infinite density one cant predict the future
1066,We wouldnt be affected by the breakdown of prediction if the singularities are not nakedthat is they are not shielded from the outside
1067,Penrose proposed the cosmic censorship conjecture all singularities formed by the collapse of stars or other bodies are hidden from view inside black holes
1068,The cosmic censorship conjecture is almost certainly true because a number of attempts to disprove it have failed
1069,John Wheeler is known for expressing this principle as A black hole has no hair
1070,A black hole has a boundary called the event horizon
1071,Because nothing can travel faster than light everything else will get dragged back also
1072,Falling through the event horizon is a bit like going over Niagara Falls in a canoe
1073,If you are above the Falls you can get away if you paddle fast enough but once you are over the edge you are lost
1074,As you get nearer the Falls the current gets faster
1075,This means it pulls harder on the front of the canoe than the back
1076,Theres a danger that the canoe will be pulled apart
1077,If you fall towards a black hole feet first gravity will pull harder on your feet than your head because they are nearer the black hole
1078,The result is that you will be stretched out lengthwise and squashed in sideways
1079,If the black hole has a mass of a few times our Sun you would be torn apart and made into spaghetti before you reached the horizon
1080,So if you want to explore the inside of a black hole make sure you choose a big one
1081,There is a black hole with a mass of about four million times that of the Sun at the centre of our Milky Way galaxy
1082,Although you wouldnt notice anything in particular as you fell into a black hole someone watching you from a distance would never see you cross the event horizon
1083,Instead you would appear to slow down and hover just outside
1084,Your image would get dimmer and dimmer and redder and redder until you were effectively lost from sight
1085,As far as the outside world is concerned you would be lost for ever
1086,Shortly after the birth of my daughter Lucy I had a eureka moment
1087,Moreover if two black holes collide and merge to form a single black hole the area of the event horizon around the resulting black hole is greater than the sum of the areas of the event horizons around the original black holes
1088,The area theorem can be tested experimentally by the Laser Interferometer GravitationalWave Observatory LIGO
1089,On September   LIGO detected gravitational waves from the collision and merger of two black holes
1090,From the waveform one can estimate the masses and angular momenta of the black holes and by the nohair theorem these determine the horizon areas
1091,These properties suggest that there is a resemblance between the area of the event horizon of a black hole and conventional classical physics specifically the concept of entropy in thermodynamics
1092,Entropy can be regarded as a measure of the disorder of a system or equivalently as a lack of knowledge of its precise state
1093,The famous second law of thermodynamics says that entropy always increases with time
1094,This discovery was the first hint of this crucial connection
1095,The analogy between the properties of black holes and the laws of thermodynamics can be extended
1096,The first law of thermodynamics says that a small change in the entropy of a system is accompanied by a proportional change in the energy of the system
1097,Brandon Carter Jim Bardeen and I found a similar law relating the change in mass of a black hole to a change in the area of the event horizon
1098,If one accepts that the area of the event horizon is analogous to entropy then it would seem that the surface gravity is analogous to temperature
1099,This makes it look as if the final black hole state is independent of whether the body that collapsed was composed of matter or antimatter or whether it was spherical or highly irregular in shape
1100,In other words a black hole of a given mass angular momentum and electric charge could have been formed by the collapse of any one of a large number of different configurations of matter
1101,Indeed if quantum effects are neglected the number of configurations would be infinite since the black hole could have been formed by the collapse of a cloud of an indefinitely large number of particles of indefinitely low mass
1102,But could the number of configurations really be infinite Quantum mechanics famously involves the Uncertainty Principle
1103,This states that it is impossible to measure both the position and speed of any object
1104,If one measures the speed of something then its position is undetermined
1105,In practice this means that it is impossible to localise anything
1106,You can never do this accurately because it will involve making a measurement of both the positions of something and its speed at the same time
1107,In turn it is then impossible to determine the size of an object
1108,It turns out that the Uncertainty Principle imposes a limit on the size of something
1109,After a little bit of calculation one finds that for a given mass of an object there is a minimum size
1110,This minimum size is small for heavy objects but as one looks at lighter and lighter objects the minimum size gets bigger and bigger
1111,This minimum size can be thought of as a consequence of the fact that in quantum mechanics objects can be thought of either as a wave or a particle
1112,The lighter an object is the longer its wavelength is and so it is more spread out
1113,The heavier an object is the shorter its wavelength and so it will seem more compact
1114,That weight is about the same as that of a grain of salt
1115,A further consequence of these ideas is that the number of configurations that could form a black hole of a given mass angular momentum and electric charge although very large may also be finite
1116,Jacob Bekenstein suggested that from this finite number one could interpret the entropy of a black hole
1117,This would imply that a black hole could be in equilibrium with thermal radiation at some temperature other than zero
1118,Yet according to classical concepts no such equilibrium is possible since the black hole would absorb any thermal radiation that fell on it but by definition would not be able to emit anything in return
1119,This created a paradox about the nature of black holes the incredibly dense objects created by the collapse of stars
1120,One theory suggested that black holes with identical qualities could be formed from an infinite number of different types of stars
1121,This is a problem of informationthe idea that every particle and every force in the universe contains information
1122,This means that a black hole must contain a lot of information that is hidden from the outside world
1123,But there is a limit to the amount of information one can pack into a region of space
1124,Information requires energy and energy has mass by Einsteins famous equation E  mc
1125,So if theres too much information in a region of space it will collapse into a black hole and the size of the black hole will reflect the amount of information
1126,It is like piling more and more books into a library
1127,Eventually the shelves will give way and the library will collapse into a black hole
1128,If the amount of hidden information inside a black hole depends on the size of the hole one would expect from general principles that the blackhole would have a temperature and would glow like a piece of hot metal
1129,But that was impossible because as everyone knew nothing could get out of a black hole
1130,To my great surprise I found that the black hole seemed to emit particles at a steady rate
1131,Like everyone else at that time I accepted the dictum that a black hole could not emit anything
1132,I therefore put quite a lot of effort into trying to get rid of this embarrassing effect
1133,But the more I thought about it the more it refused to go away so that in the end I had to accept it
1134,My calculations predicted that a black hole creates and emits particles and radiation just as if it were an ordinary hot body with a temperature that is proportional to the surface gravity and inversely proportional to the mass
1135,This made the problematic suggestion of Jacob Bekenstein that a black hole had a finite entropy fully consistent since it implied that a black hole could be in thermal equilibrium at some finite temperature other than zero
1136,Since that time the mathematical evidence that black holes emit thermal radiation has been confirmed by a number of other people with various different approaches
1137,These particles are called virtual because unlike real particles they cannot be observed directly with a particle detector
1138,Another way of looking at the process is to regard the member of thepair of particles that falls into the black hole the antiparticle say as being really a particle that is travelling backwards in time
1139,Thus the antiparticle falling into the black hole can be regarded as a particle coming out of the black hole but travelling backwards in time
1140,A black hole of the mass of the Sun would leak particles at such a slow rate that it would be impossible to detect
1141,These might have formed in the very early universe if it had been chaotic and irregular
1142,A mountainsized black hole would give off Xrays and gamma rays at a rate of about ten million megawatts enough to power the worlds electricity supply
1143,You couldnt keep it in a power station because it would drop through the floor and end up at the centre of the Earth
1144,If we had such a black hole about the only way to keep hold of it would be to have it in orbit around the Earth
1145,People have searched for mini black holes of this mass but have so far not found any
1146,This is a pity because if they had I would have got a Nobel Prize
1147,According to some theories the universe we experience is just a four dimensional surface in a ten or elevendimensional space
1148,We wouldnt see these extra dimensions because light wouldnt propagate through them but only through the four dimensions of our universe
1149,This would make it much easier to form a little black hole in the extra dimensions
1150,It might be possible to observe this at the LHC the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland
1151,Two beams of particles travel round this tunnel in opposite directions and are made to collide
1152,These would radiate particles in a pattern that would be easy to recognise
1153,As particles escape from a black hole the hole will lose mass and shrink
1154,Eventually theblack hole will lose all its mass and disappear
1155,But if information is lost this raises a serious problem that strikes at the heart of our understanding of science
1156,For more than  years we have believed in scientific determinismthat is that the laws of science determine the evolution of the universe
1157,If information were really lost in black holes we wouldnt be able to predict the future because a black hole could emit any collection of particles
1158,It could emit a working television set or a leatherbound volume of the complete works of Shakespeare though the chance of such exotic emissions is very low
1159,It is much more likely to emit thermal radiation like the glow from redhot metal
1160,If determinism the predictability of the universe breaks down with black holes it could break down in other situations
1161,There could be virtual black holes that appear as fluctuations out of the vacuum absorb one set of particles emit another and disappear into the vacuum again
1162,Even worse if determinism breaks down we cant be sure of our past history either
1163,The history books and our memories could just be illusions
1164,It was therefore very important to determine whether information really was lost in black holes or whether in principle it could be recovered
1165,This apparent loss of information known as the information paradox has troubled scientists for the last forty years and still remains one of the biggest unsolved problems in theoretical physics
1166,Recently interest in possible resolutions of the information paradox has been revived as new discoveries have been made about the unification of gravity and quantum mechanics
1167,Central to these recent breakthroughs is the understanding of the symmetries of spacetime
1168,Suppose there was no gravity and spacetime was completely flat
1169,If you moved from one point in the desert to another you would not notice any change
1170,These symmetries are also found in flat spacetime the spacetime one finds in the absence of any matter
1171,If one put something into this desert these symmetries would be broken
1172,Suppose there was a mountain an oasis and some cacti in the desert it would look different in different places and in different directions
1173,If one puts objects into a spacetime the translational and rotational symmetries get broken
1174,Very far away from the black hole spacetime looks very much like flat spacetime
1175,van der Burg and Rainer Sachs made the truly remarkable discovery that spacetime far away from any matter has an infinite collection of symmetries known as supertranslations
1176,Each of these symmetries is associated with a conserved quantity known as the supertranslation charges
1177,A conserved quantity is a quantity that does not change as a system evolves
1178,For example if spacetime does not change in time then energy is conserved
1179,If spacetime looks the same at different points in space then momentum is conserved
1180,It is these conservation laws that have given an extraordinary and unexpected insight into process in gravitational physics
1181,In  together with my collaborators Malcolm Perry and Andy Strominger I was working on using these new results with their associated conserved quantities to find a possible resolution to theinformation paradox
1182,We know that the three discernible properties of black holes are their mass their charge and their angular momentum
1183,These are the classical charges that have been understood for a long time
1184,So perhaps black holes have a lot more to them than we first thought
1185,They are not bald or with only three hairs but actually have a very large amount of supertranslation hair
1186,If this is right and all the information about a black hole can be understood in terms of its hairs then perhaps there is no loss of information
1187,These ideas have just received confirmation with our most recent calculations
1188,Strominger Perry and myself together with a graduate student Sasha Haco have discovered that these superrotation charges an account for the entire entropy of any black hole
1189,Quantum mechanics continues to hold and information is stored on the horizon the surface of the black hole
1190,People are still working on these issues and therefore the information paradox remains unresolved
1191,But I am optimistic that we are moving towards a solution
1192,Nobel Prizes cannot be awarded posthumously so sadly this ambition will now never be realised
1193,Is falling into a black hole bad news for a space traveller Definitely bad news
1194,If it were a stellar mass black hole youwould be made into spaghetti before reaching the horizon
1195,On the other hand if it were a supermassive black hole you would cross the horizon with ease but be crushed out of existence at the singularity
1196,IS TIME TRAVEL POSSIBLEI n science fiction space and time warps are commonplace
1197,They are used for rapid journeys around the galaxy or for travel through time
1198,For more than  years the axioms of Euclidean geometry were considered to be selfevident
1199,These are the shortest paths between two points so they are the routes that airlines use
1200,Consider now the triangle on the surface of the Earth made up of the equator the line of  degrees longitude through London and the line of  degrees longtitude east through Bangladesh
1201,The two lines of longitude meet the equator at a right angle or  degrees
1202,The two lines of longitude also meet each other at the North Pole at a right angle or  degrees
1203,If one drew a triangle on a saddleshaped surface one would find that the angles added up to less than  degrees
1204,Thatis you can move on the surface of the Earth in two directions at right angles to each other you can move northsouth or eastwest
1205,But of course there is a third direction at right angles to these two and that is up or down
1206,In other words the surface of the Earth exists in three dimensional space
1207,For them space would be curved and geometry would be nonEuclidean
1208,If the sphere were very large space would be nearly flat and Euclidean geometry would be a very good approximation over small distances
1209,But we would notice that Euclidean geometry broke down over large distances
1210,As an illustration of this imagine a team of painters adding paint to the surface of a large ball
1211,As the thickness of the paint layer increased the surface area would go up
1212,If the ball were in a flat threedimensional space one could go on adding paint indefinitely and the ball would get bigger and bigger
1213,As one added more layers of paint the ball would eventually fill half the space
1214,So they would know that they were living in a curved space and not a flat one
1215,Instead one has to measure the space we live in and find out its geometry by experiment
1216,General relativity was a major intellectual revolution that has transformed the way we think about the universe
1217,It is a theory not only of curved space but of curved or warped time as well
1218,One can describe the location of an event by four numbers
1219,They could be miles north and east of Oxford Circus and the height above sea level
1220,On a larger scale they could be galactic latitude and longitude and distance from the centre of the galaxy
1221,Thus one can think of space and time together as a fourdimensional entity called spacetime
1222,Each point of spacetime is labelled by four numbers that specify its position in space and in time
1223,Combining space and time into spacetime in this way would be rather trivial if one could disentangle them in a unique way
1224,That is to say if there was a unique way of defining the time and position of each event
1225,This meant that time and space were inextricably bound up with each other
1226,The times that different observers would assign to events would agree if the observers were not moving relative to each other
1227,But they would disagree more the faster their relative speed
1228,So all we need for time travel is a spaceship that will go faster than light
1229,So it would take an infinite amount of power to accelerate past the speed of light
1230,Einsteins paper of  seemed to rule out time travel into the past
1231,It also indicated that space travel to other stars was going to be a very slow and tedious business
1232,If one couldnt go faster than light the round trip from us to the nearest star would take at least eight years and to the centre of the galaxy about  years
1233,If the spaceship went very near the speed of light it might seem to the people on board that the trip to the galactic centre had taken only a few years
1234,That wouldnt be much good for sciencefiction novels either so writers had to look for ways to get round this difficulty
1235,We can actually observe this warping of spacetime produced by the mass of the Sun in the slight bending of light or radio waves passing close to the Sun
1236,The shift is very small about a thousandth of a degree equivalent to a movement of an inch at a distance of a mile
1237,Nevertheless it can be measured with great accuracy and it agrees with the predictions of general relativity
1238,We have experimental evidence that space and time are warped
1239,The amount of warping in our neighbourhood is very small because all the gravitational fields in the solar system are weak
1240,So can space and time be warped enough to meet the demands from science fiction for things like hyperspace drives wormholes or time travel At first sight all these seem possible
1241,In this universe it would be possible to go off in a spaceship and come back before you had set out
1242,He was more famous for proving you couldnt prove everything that is true even in such anapparently simple subject as arithmetic
1243,A particularly interesting one from an approach known as string theory contains two cosmic strings moving past each other at a speed very near to but slightly less than the speed of light
1244,As their name suggests they are like string in that they have length but a tiny crosssection
1245,Actually they are more like rubber bands because they are under enormous tension something like a hundred billion billion billion tonnes
1246,A cosmic string attached to the Sun would accelerate it from nought to sixty in a thirtieth of a second
1247,Cosmic strings may sound farfetched and pure science fiction but there are good scientific reasons to believe they could have formed in the very early universe shortly after the Big Bang
1248,Because they are under such great tension one might have expected them to accelerate to almost the speed of light
1249,God might have created such a warped universe but we have no reason to think that he did
1250,All the evidence is that the universe started out in the Big Bang without the kind of warping needed to allow travel into the past
1251,Since we cant change the way the universe began the question of whether time travel is possible is one of whether we can subsequently make spacetime so warped that one can go back to the past
1252,I think this is an important subject for research but one has to be careful not to be labelled a crank
1253,If one made a research grant application to work on time travel it would be dismissed immediately
1254,No government agency could afford to be seen to be spending public money on anything as way out as time travel
1255,So the only way to get from one side of the galaxy to the other in a reasonable time would seem to be if we could warp spacetime so much that we created a little tube or wormhole
1256,This could connect the two sides of the galaxy and act as a short cut to get from one to the other and back while your friends were still alive
1257,Such wormholes have been seriously suggested as being within the capabilities of a future civilisation
1258,But if you can travel from one side of the galaxy to the other in a week or two you could go back through another wormhole and arrive back before you had set out
1259,You could even manage to travel back in time with a single wormhole if its two ends were moving relative to each other
1260,Ordinary matter curves spacetime back on itself like the surface of the Earth
1261,The same is true of any other way of warping spacetime to allow travel to the past if the universe didnt begin so warped that it allowed time travel
1262,If you have a positive bank balance you can distribute it in various ways
1263,But according to the classical laws that were believed until quite recently you werent allowed to have an energy overdraft
1264,So these classical laws would have ruled out us being able to warp the universe in the way required to allow time travel
1265,Quantum theory is more relaxed and allows you to have an overdraft on one or two accounts
1266,In other words quantum theory allows the energy density to be negative in some places provided it is positive in others
1267,The reason quantum theory can allow the energy density to be negative is that it is based on the Uncertainty Principle
1268,This says that certain quantities like the position and speed of a particle cant both have well defined values
1269,The more accurately the position of a particle is defined the greater is the uncertainty in its speed and vice versa
1270,The Uncertainty Principle also applies to fields like the electromagnetic field or the gravitational field
1271,Instead the fields would have to have a certain minimum amount of fluctuations
1272,One can interpret these socalled vacuum fluctuations as pairs of particles and antiparticles that suddenly appear together move apart and then come back together again and annihilate each other
1273,These particleantiparticle pairs are said to be virtual because one cannot measure them directly with a particle detector
1274,Imagine that you have two parallel metal plates a short distance apart
1275,The plates act like mirrors for the virtual particles and antiparticles
1276,This means that the region between the plates is a bit like an organ pipe and will only admit light waves of certain resonant frequencies
1277,The difference in the number of virtual particles between the plates compared with outside the plates means that they dont exert as much pressure on one side of the plates compared with the other
1278,There is thus a slight force pushing the plates together
1279,Because there are fewer virtual particles or vacuum fluctuations between the plates they have a lower energy density than in the region outside
1280,But the energy density of empty space far away from the plates must be zero
1281,Otherwise it would warp spacetime and the universe wouldnt be nearly flat
1282,So the energy density in the region between the plates must be negative
1283,We thus have experimental evidence from the bending of light that spacetime is curved and confirmation from the Casimir effect that we can warp it in the negative direction
1284,So it might seem that as we advance in science and technology we might be able to construct a wormhole or warp space and time in some other way so as to be able to travel into our past
1285,Of course some people would claim that we have already been visited from the future
1286,They would say that UFOs come from the future and that governments are engaged in a gigantic conspiracy to cover them up and keep for themselves the scientific knowledge that these visitors bring
1287,All I can say is that if governments were hiding something they are doing a poor job of extracting useful information from the aliens
1288,Im pretty sceptical of conspiracy theories as I believe that cockup theory is more likely
1289,The reports of sightings of UFOs cannot all be caused by extra terrestrials because they are mutually contradictory
1290,But once you admit that some are mistakes or hallucinations isnt it more probable that they all are than that we are being visited by people from the future or from the other side of the galaxy If they really want to colonise the Earth or warn us of some danger they are being rather ineffective
1291,A possible way to reconcile time travel with the fact that we dont seem to have had any visitors from the future would be to say that such travel can occur only in the future
1292,In this view one would say spacetime in our past was fixed because we have observed it and seen that it is not warped enough to allow travel into the past
1293,So we might be able to warp it enough to allow time travel
1294,But because we can warp spacetime only in the future we wouldnt be able to travel back to the present time or earlier
1295,Suppose it were possible to go off in a rocket ship and come back before you had set off
1296,It says that one has to find a consistent solution of the equations of physics even if spacetime is so warped that it is possible to travel into the past
1297,On this view you couldnt set out on the rocket ship to travel into the past unless you had already come back and failed to blow up the launch pad
1298,It is a consistent picture but it would imply that we were completely determined we couldnt change our minds
1299,In this view in one alternative history there would not have been any return from the future before the rocket set off and so no possibility of it being blown up
1300,In this the human race makes a tremendous effort to build a spaceship but just before it is due to be launched a similar spaceship appears from the other side of the galaxy and destroys it
1301,David Deutsch claims support for the alternativehistories approach from the sumoverhistories concept introduced by the physicist Richard Feynman
1302,The idea is that according to quantum theory the universe doesnt just have a unique single history
1303,Instead the universe has every single possible history each with its own probability
1304,In some histories spacetime will be so warped that objects like rockets will be able to travel into their pasts
1305,But each history is complete and selfcontained describing not only the curved spacetime but also the objects in it
1306,It thus seems that we are stuck with the consistenthistories picture
1307,The density of the virtual particles and their energy become very large
1308,This means that the probability of these histories is very low
1309,Thus it seems there may be a Chronology Protection Agency at work making the world safe for historians
1310,But this subject of space and time warps is still in its infancy
1311,The idea is that seven of these eleven dimensions are curled up into a space so small that we dont notice them
1312,If this picture is correct it might be possible to arrange that the four flat directions get mixed up with the seven highly curved or warped directions
1313,In conclusion rapid space travel and travel back in time cant be ruled out according to our present understanding
1314,They would cause great logical problems so lets hope theres a Chronology Protection Law to prevent people going back and killing their parents
1315,Is there any point in hosting a party for time travellers Would you hope anyone would turn up In  I held a party for time travellers in my college Gonville and Caius in Cambridge for a film about time travel
1316,To ensure that only genuine time travellers came I didnt send out the invitations until after the party
1317,On the day of theparty I sat in college hoping but no one came
1318,I would have been delighted if one of my assumptions had turned out to be wrong
1319,Robert Oppenheimer the chief scientist for the Manhattan Project said later of the first explosion of an atomic bomb two years earlier in July  We knew the world would not be the same
1320,A few people laughed a few people cried most people were silent
1321,I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture the BhagavadGita Now I am become Death the destroyer of worlds
1322,In  the clock was originally set at seven minutes to midnight
1323,It is now closer to Doomsday than at any time since then save in the early s at the start of the Cold War
1324,The clock and its movements are of course entirely symbolic but I feel compelled to point out that such an alarming warning from other scientists prompted at least in part by the election of Donald Trump must be taken seriously
1325,Is the clock and the idea that time is ticking or even running out for the human race realistic or alarmist Is its warning timely or timewasting I have a very personal interest in time
1326,Firstly my bestselling book and the main reason that I am known beyond the confines of the scientific community was called  A Brief History of Time
1327,So some might imagine that I am an expert on time although of course these days an expert is not necessarily a good thing to be
1328,I am uncomfortably acutely aware of the passage of time and have lived much of my life with a sense that the time that I have been granted is as they say borrowed
1329,It is without doubt the case that our world is more politically unstable than at any time in my memory
1330,Large numbers of people feel left behind both economically and socially
1331,So that would imply that a Doomsday Clock should be moved closer to a critical point as the prospect of careless or malicious forces precipitating Armageddon grows
1332,The Earth is under threat from so many areas that it is difficult for me to be positive
1333,First th e Earth is becoming too small for us
1334,Our physical resources are being drained at an alarming rate
1335,We have presented our planet with the disastrous gift of climate change
1336,Rising temperatures reduction of the polar ice caps deforestation overpopulation disease war famine lack of water and decimation of animal species these are all solvable but so far have not been solved
1337,We want cars travel and a better standard of living
1338,As we stand on the brink of a Second Nuclear Age and a period of unprecedented climate change scientists have a special responsibility once again to inform the public and to advise leaders about the perils that humanity faces
1339,As citizens of the world we have a duty to share that knowledge and to alert the public to the unnecessary risks that we live with every day
1340,We foresee great peril if governments and societies do not take action now to render nuclear weapons obsolete and to prevent further climate change
1341,At the same time many of those same politicians are denying the reality of manmade climate change or at least the ability of man toreverse it just at the moment that our world is facing a series of critical environmental crises
1342,The danger is that global warming may become selfsustaining if it has not become so already
1343,The melting of the Arctic and Antarctic ice caps reduces the fraction of solar energy reflected back into space and so increases the temperature further
1344,The rise in sea temperature may trigger the release of large quantities of carbon dioxide
1345,Both these phenomena would increase the greenhouse effect and so exacerbate global warming
1346,Both effects could make our climate like that of Venus boiling hot and raining sulphuric acid with a temperature of  degrees centigrade  degrees Fahrenheit
1347,We need to go beyond the Kyoto Protocol the international agreement adopted in  and cut carbon emissions now
1348,We are running out of space and the only places to go to are other worlds
1349,Stars engulf planets supernovae fire lethal rays across space black holes bump into each other and asteroids hurtle around at hundreds of miles a second
1350,The last big such collision with us was about sixtysix million years ago and that is thought to have killed the dinosaurs and it will happen again
1351,This is not science fiction it is guaranteed by the laws of physics and probability
1352,Nuclear war is still probably the greatest threat to humanity at the present time
1353,Russia and the United States are no longer so triggerhappy but suppose theres an accident or terrorists get hold of the weapons these countries still have
1354,And the risk increases the more countries obtain nuclear weapons
1355,Even after the end of the Cold War there are still enough nuclear weapons stockpiled to kill us all several times over and new nuclear nations will add to the instability
1356,With time the nuclear threat may decrease butother threats will develop so we must remain on our guard
1357,By then I hope and believe that our ingenious race will have found a way to slip the surly bonds of Earth and will therefore survive the disaster
1358,The same of course may not be possible for the millions of other species that inhabit the Earth and that will be on our conscience as a race
1359,I think we are acting with reckless indifference to our future on planet Earth
1360,It is this driven curiosity that sent explorers to prove the Earth is not flat and it is the same instinct that sends us to the stars at the speed of thought urging us to go there in reality
1361,To leave Earth demands a concerted global approacheveryone should join in
1362,We need to rekindle the excitement of the early days of space travel in the s
1363,Spreading out may be the only thing that saves us from ourselves
1364,The producers of  Star Trek  even persuaded me to take part not that it was difficult
1365,That appearance was great fun but I mention it to make a seriouspoint
1366,In the period between now and then there must have been great changes with their accompanying tensions and upsets
1367,I question this picture and ask if we will ever reach a final steady state of science and technology
1368,At no time in the  years or so since the last Ice Age has the human race been in a state of constant knowledge and fixed technology
1369,In the last  years the growth has at times been exponential and the world population has jumped from  billion to about
1370,Other measures of technological development in recent times are electricity consumption or the number of scientific articles
1371,Indeed we now have such heightened expectations that some people feel cheated by politicians and scientists because we have not already achieved the Utopian visions of the future
1372,There is no sign that scientific and technological development will dramatically slow down and stop in the near future
1373,But the present rate of growth cannot continue for the next millennium
1374,By the year  the worlds population would be standing shoulder to shoulder and the electricity consumption would make the Earth glow red hot
1375,If you stacked the new books being published next to each other at the present rate of production you would have to move at ninety miles an hour just to keep up with the end of the line
1376,Of course by  new artistic and scientific work will come in electronic forms rather than as physical books and papers
1377,Nevertheless if the exponential growth continued there would be ten papers a second in my kind of theoretical physics and notime to read them
1378,Even if we dont destroy ourselves completely there is the possibility that we might descend into a state of brutalism and barbarity like the opening scene of  Terminator
1379,But let me stick my neck out and offer my predictions for the future
1380,I will have some chance of being right about the next hundred years but the rest of the millennium will be wild speculation
1381,That is they move forwards in time on one side of the loop and backwards in time on the other side
1382,The awkward thing is that because theres an infinite number of points in space and time theres an infinite number of possible closed loops of particles
1383,And an infinite number of closed loops of particles would have an infinite amount of energy and would curl space and time up to a single point
1384,Even science fiction did not think of anything as odd as this
1385,Only then will we be able to unify quantum theory with Einsteins general relativity and achieve a complete theory of the basic laws of the universe
1386,In  I said I thought there was a  chance that we would discover a complete unified theory in the next twenty years
1387,We have made some remarkable progress in the period since then but the final theory seems about the same distance away
1388,Will the Holy Grail of physics be always just beyond our reach I think not
1389,At the beginning of the twentieth century we understood the workings of nature on the scales of classical physics that are good down to about a hundredth of a millimetre
1390,The work on atomic physics in the first thirty years of the century took our understanding down to lengths of a millionth of a millimetre
1391,Since then research on nuclear and high energy physics has taken us to length scales that are smaller by a further factor of a billion
1392,It might seem that we could go on forever discovering structures on smaller and smaller length scales
1393,In physics the smallest doll is called the Planck length and is a millimetre divided by a  billion billion billion
1394,We are not about to build particle accelerators that can probe to distances that small
1395,They would have to be larger than the solar system and they are not likely to be approved in the present financial climate
1396,It wont be possible to probe down to the Planck length in the laboratory though we can study the Big Bang to get observational evidence at higher energies and shorter length scales than we can achieve on Earth
1397,But I dont think we will ever reach a steady state in the uses we make of these laws
1398,The ultimate theory willplace no limit on the complexity of systems that we can produce and it is in this complexity that I think the most important developments of the next millennium will be
1399,By far the most complex systems that we have are our own bodies
1400,Life seems to have originated in the primordial oceans that covered the Earth four billion years ago
1401,It may be that random collisions between atoms built up macromolecules that could reproduce themselves and assemble themselves into more complicated structures
1402,The two strands of the double helix are linked by pairs of nitrogenous bases like the treads in a spiral staircase
1403,There are four kinds of nitrogenous bases cytosine guanine adenine and thymine
1404,As the DNA made copies of itself there would have been occasional errors in the order of the nitrogenous bases along the spiral
1405,In most cases the mistakes in copying would have made the DNA unable to reproduce itself
1406,Such genetic errors or mutations as they are called would die out
1407,But in a few cases the error or mutation would increase the chances of the DNA surviving and reproducing
1408,Thus the information content in the sequence of nitrogenous bases would gradually evolve and increase in complexity
1409,This natural selection of mutations was first proposed by another Cambridge man Charles Darwin in  though he didnt know the mechanism for it
1410,Because biological evolution is basically a random walk in the space of all genetic possibilities it has been very slow
1411,The complexity or number of bits of information that are coded in DNA is given roughly by the number of nitrogenous bases in the molecule
1412,Each bit of information canbe thought of as the answer to a yesno question
1413,For the first two billion years or so the rate of increase in complexity must have been of the order of one bit of information every hundred years
1414,The rate of increase of DNA complexity gradually rose to about one bit a year over the last few million years
1415,There has been relatively little change in human DNA in the last  years
1416,But it is likely that we will be able to redesign it completely in the next thousand
1417,Of course many people will say that genetic engineering on humans should be banned
1418,But I rather doubt that they will be able to prevent it
1419,Genetic engineering on plants and animals will be allowed for economic reasons and someone is bound to try it on humans
1420,Clearly developing improved humans will create great social and political problems with respect to unimproved humans
1421,Im not advocating human genetic engineering as a good thing Im just saying that it is likely to happen in the next millennium whether we want it or not
1422,I think the human race and its DNA will increase its complexity quite rapidly
1423,In a way the human race needs to improve its mental and physical qualities if it is to deal with the increasingly complex world around it and meet new challenges like space travel
1424,And it also needs to increase its complexity if biological systems are to keep ahead of electronic ones
1425,This is not surprising because our present computers are less complex than the brain of an earthworm a species not noted for its intellectual powers
1426,It is one of these exponential growths that clearly cannot continue indefinitely and indeed it has already begun to slow
1427,But it seems to me that if very complicated chemical molecules can operate in humans to make them intelligent then equally complicated electroniccircuits can also make computers act in an intelligent way
1428,And if they are intelligent they can presumably design computers that have even greater complexity and intelligence
1429,Instead I expect complexity to increase at a rapid rate in both the biological and the electronic spheres
1430,But by the end of the next millennium if we get there the change will be fundamental
1431,Lincoln Steffens once said I have seen the future and it works
1432,Nevertheless I think the present world order has a future but it will be very different
1433,But the last big such asteroid collision was about sixtysix million years ago and killed the dinosaurs
1434,A rise in ocean temperature would melt the ice caps and cause the release of large amounts of carbon dioxide
1435,Both effects could make our climate like that of Venus with a temperature of  degrees centigrade  degrees Fahrenheit
1436,Not to leave planet Earth would be like castaways on a desert island not trying to escape
1437,In a way the situation is like that in Europe before
1438,People might well have argued that it was a waste of money to send Columbus on a wild goose chase
1439,Yet the discovery of the New World made a profound difference to the Old
1440,Just think we wouldnt have had the Big Mac or KFC
1441,Spreading out into space will have an even greater effect
1442,It will completely change the future of the human race and maybe determine whether we have any future at all
1443,It wont solve any of our immediate problems on planet Earth but it will give us a new perspective on them and cause us to look outwards rather than inwards
1444,Hopefully it will unite us to face the common challenge
1445,This would be a longterm strategy and by long term I mean hundreds or even thousands of years
1446,We could have a base on the Moon within thirty years reach Mars in fifty years and explore the moons of the outer planets in  years
1447,We have already driven rovers on Mars and landed a probe on Titan a moon of Saturn but if we are considering the future of the human race we have to go there ourselves
1448,Going into space wont be cheap but it would take only a small proportion of world resources
1449,NASAs budget has remained roughlyconstant in real terms since the time of the Apollo landings but it has decreased from
1450,Even if we were to increase the international budget twenty times to make a serious effort to go into space it would only be a small fraction of world GDP
1451,Im not denying the importance of fighting climate change and global warming but we can do that and still spare a quarter of a per cent of world GDP for space
1452,Isnt our future worth a quarter of a per cent We thought space was worth a big effort in the s
1453,In  President Kennedy committed the US to landing a man on the Moon by the end of the decade
1454,On July   Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong landed on the surface of the Moon
1455,I was twentyseven at the time a researcher at Cambridge and I missed it
1456,There was no catchup TV in those days and we didnt have a television but my son aged two described it to me
1457,The space race helped to create a fascination with science and accelerated our technological progress
1458,Many of todays scientists were inspired to go into science as a result of the Moon landings with the aim of understanding more about ourselves and our place in the universe
1459,This went along with a general disenchantment with science in the West because although it had brought great benefits it had not solved the social problems that increasingly occupied public attention
1460,A new crewed space flight programme would do a lot to restore public enthusiasm for space and for science generally
1461,Robotic missions are much cheaper and may provide more scientific information but they dont catch the public imagination in the same way
1462,A goal of a base on the Moon by  and of a mannedlanding on Mars by  would reignite the space programme and give it a sense of purpose in the same way that President Kennedys Moon target did in the s
1463,In late  Elon Musk announced SpaceX plans for a lunar base and a Mars mission by  and President Trump signed a space policy directive refocusing NASA on exploration and discovery so perhaps well get there even sooner
1464,A new interest in space would also increase the public standing of science generally
1465,We live in a society that is increasingly governed by science and technology yet fewer and fewer young people want to go into science
1466,A new and ambitious space programme would excite the young and stimulate them into entering a wide range of sciences not just astrophysics and space science
1467,But for so many years I thought it was just that a dream
1468,I never thought I would have the opportunity to see our beautiful planet from space or gaze out into the infinity beyond
1469,And in  I was fortunate enough to go on a zerogravity flight and experience weightlessness for the first time
1470,It only lasted for four minutes but it was amazing
1471,I was quoted at the time as saying that I feared the human race is not going to have a future if we dont go into space
1472,And I hope I demonstrated then that anyone can take part in space travel
1473,I believe it is up to scientists like me together with innovative commercial entrepreneurs to do all we can to promote the excitement and wonder of space travel
1474,One would therefore want any longterm base for human beings to be on a planet or moon
1475,By digging into the surface one would get thermal insulation and protection from meteors and cosmic rays
1476,The planet or moon could also serve as a source of the raw materials that would be needed if the extraterrestrial community was to be selfsustaining independent of Earth
1477,We have already landed on it and driven across it in a buggy
1478,On the other hand the Moon is small and without atmosphere or a magnetic field to deflect the solarradiation particles like on Earth
1479,There is no liquid water although there may be ice in the craters at the North and South Poles
1480,A colony on the Moon could use this as a source of oxygen with power provided by nuclear energy or solar panels
1481,The Moon could be a base for travel to the rest of the solar system
1482,It is half as far again as the Earth from the Sun and so receives half the warmth
1483,It once had a magnetic field but it decayed four billion years ago leaving Mars without protection from solar radiation
1484,This stripped Mars of most of its atmosphere leaving it with only  per cent of the pressure of the Earths atmosphere
1485,Liquid water cannot exist on the surface of Mars now
1486,There is no sign of life on Mars now but if we found evidence that life had once existed it would indicate that the probability of life developing on a suitable planet was fairly high
1487,We must be careful though that we dont confuse the issue by contaminating the planet with life from Earth
1488,Similarly we must be very careful not to bring back any Martian life
1489,We would have no resistance to it and it might wipe out life on Earth
1490,NASA has sent a large number of spacecraft to Mars starting with Mariner  in
1491,It has surveyed the planet with a number of orbiters the latest being the Mars reconnaissance orbiter
1492,These orbiters have revealed deep gulleys and the highest mountains in the solar system
1493,NASA has also landed a number of probes on the surface of Mars mostrecently the two Mars rovers
1494,These have sent back pictures of a dry desert landscape
1495,Like on the Moon water and oxygen might be obtainable from polar ice
1496,The Moon and Mars are the most suitable sites for space colonies in the solar system
1497,Mercury and Venus are too hot while Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants with no solid surface
1498,The moons of Mars are very small and have no advantages over Mars itself
1499,Some of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn might be possible
1500,Europa a moon of Jupiter has a frozen ice surface
1501,So far we can detect only giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn but it is reasonable to assume that they will be accompanied by smaller Earthlike planets
1502,There are around a thousand stars within thirty light years of Earth
1503,If  per cent of these have Earthsized planets in the Goldilocks zone we have ten candidate New Worlds
1504,Travelling to these candidate worlds isnt possible perhaps with todays technology but by using our imagination we can make interstellar travel a longterm aimin the next  to  years
1505,The exhaustspeed of chemical rockets like the ones we have used so far is about three kilometres per second
1506,By jettisoning  per cent of their mass they can achieve a speed of about half a kilometre per second and then slow down again
1507,According to NASA it would take as little as  days to reach Mars give or take ten days with some NASA scientists predicting as little as  days
1508,But it would take three million years to get to the nearest star system
1509,To go faster would require a much higher exhaust speed than chemical rockets can provide that of light itself
1510,A powerful beam of light from the rear could drive the spaceship forward
1511,Beyond that we would need either matterantimatter annihilation or some completely new form of energy
1512,In fact the distance to Alpha Centauri is so great that to reach it in a human lifetime a spacecraft would have to carry fuel with roughly the mass of all the stars in the galaxy
1513,In other words with current technology interstellar travel is utterly impractical
1514,We have a chance to change that thanks to imagination and ingenuity
1515,In  I joined with the entrepreneur Yuri Milner to launch Breakthrough Starshot a longterm research and development programme aimed at making interstellar travel a reality
1516,If we succeed we will send a probe to Alpha Centauri within the lifetime of people alive today
1517,Forty years on our most intrepid explorer Voyager has just made it to interstellar space
1518,Its speed eleven miles a second means it would take about  years to reach Alpha Centauri
1519,If there are beings alive on Alpha Centauri today they remain blissfully ignorant of the rise of Donald Trump
1520,It is clear we are entering a new space age
1521,The first private astronauts will be pioneers and the first flights will be hugely expensive but over time it is my hope that space flight will become within the reach of far more of the Earths population
1522,Breakthrough Starshot is a real opportunity for man to make early forays into outer space with a view to probing and weighing the possibilities of colonisation
1523,It is a proofofconcept mission and works on three concepts miniaturised spacecraft light propulsion and phase locked lasers
1524,The Star Chip a fully functional space probe reduced to a few centimetres in size will be attached to a light sail
1525,Made from metamaterials the light sail weighs no more than a few grams
1526,It is envisaged that a thousand Star Chips and light sails the nanocraft will be sent into orbit
1527,On the ground an array of lasers at the kilometre scale will combine into a single very powerful light beam
1528,The beam is fired through the atmosphere striking the sails in space with tens of gigawatts of power
1529,The idea behind this innovation is that the nanocraft ride on the light beam much as Einstein dreamed about riding a light beam at the age of sixteen
1530,Not quite to the speed of light but to a fifth of it or  million miles an hour
1531,Such a system could reach Mars in less than an hour reach Pluto in days pass Voyager in under a week and reach Alpha Centauri in just over twenty years
1532,Once there the nanocraft could image any planets discovered in the system test for magnetic fields and organic molecules and send the data back to Earth in another laser beam
1533,This tiny signal would be received by the same array of dishes that were used to transit the launch beam and return is estimated to take about four light years
1534,Importantly the Star Chips trajectories may include a flyby of Proxima b the Earthsized planet that is in the habitable zone of its host star in Alpha Centauri
1535,In  Breakthrough and the European Southern Observatory joined forces to further a search for habitable planets in Alpha Centauri
1536,It would explore the solar system and detect asteroids that cross the path of Earths orbit around the Sun
1537,In addition the German physicist Claudius Gros has proposed that this technology may also be used to establish a biosphere of unicellular microbes on otherwise only transiently habitable exoplanets
1538,A laser with a gigawatt of power would provide only a few newtons of thrust
1539,But thenanocraft compensate for this by having a mass of only a few grams
1540,The nanocraft must survive extreme acceleration cold vacuum and protons as well as collisions with junk such as space dust
1541,In addition focusing a set of lasers totalling  gigawatts on the solar sails will be difficult due to atmospheric turbulence
1542,But these are engineering problems and engineers challenges tend eventually to be solved
1543,As it progresses into a mature technology other exciting missions can be envisaged
1544,Even with less powerful laser arrays journey times to other planets to the outer solar system or to interstellar space could be vastly reduced
1545,Of course this would not be human interstellar travel even if it could be scaled up to a crewed vessel
1546,And if Breakthrough Starshot should send back images of a habitable planet orbiting our closest neighbour it could be of immense importance to the future of humanity
1547,If we find a planet in the Alpha Centauri system its image captured by a camera travelling at a fifth of light speed will be slightly distorted due to the effects of special relativity
1548,It would be the first time a spacecraft has flown fast enough to see such effects
1549,Without it we would have neither lasers nor the ability to perform the calculations necessary for guidance imaging and data transmission over twentyfive trillion miles at a fifth of light speed
1550,We are standing at the threshold of a new era
1551,Human colonisation on other planets is no longer science fiction
1552,The human race has existed as a separate species for about two million years
1553,Civilisation began about  years ago and the rate of development has been steadily increasing
1554,I would be one of the first to buy a ticket
1555,But travel to the stars will take a bit longer
1556,I reckon in  years we will have visited some of the nearby stars
1557,So a round trip will take at least ten years and probably much longer
1558,Everything that civilisation has to offer is a product of human intelligence
1559,This information processing got so intelligent that life forms became conscious
1560,I also believe that evolution implies there can be no qualitative difference between the brain of an earthworm and that of a human
1561,It therefore follows that computers can in principle emulate human intelligence or even better it
1562,Its clearly possible for  something to acquire higher intelligence than its ancestors we evolved to be smarter than our apelike ancestors and Einstein was smarter than his parents
1563,If computers continue to obey Moores Law doubling their speed and memory capacity every eighteen months the result is that computers are likely to overtake humans in intelligence at some point in the next hundred years
1564,Its tempting to dismiss the notion of highly intelligent machines as mere science fiction but this would be a mistake and potentially our worst mistake ever
1565,For the last twenty years or so AI has been focused on the problems surrounding the construction of intelligent agents systems that perceive and act in a particular environment
1566,In this context intelligence is related to statistical and economic notions of rationalitythat is colloquially the ability to make good decisions plans or inferences
1567,As a result of this recent work there has been a large degree of integration and cross fertilisation among AI machinelearning statistics control theory neuroscience and other fields
1568,The establishment of shared theoretical frameworks combined with the availability of data and processing power has yielded remarkable successes in various component tasks such as speech recognition image classification autonomous vehicles machine translation legged locomotion and questionanswering systems
1569,There is now a broad consensus that AI research is progressing steadily and that its impact on society is likely to increase
1570,Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history
1571,Used as a toolkit AI can augment our existing intelligence to open up advances in every area of science and society
1572,While primitive forms of artificial intelligence developed so far have proved very useful I fear the consequences of creating something that can match or surpass humans
1573,The concern is that AI would take off on its own and redesign itself at an everincreasing rate
1574,And in the future AI could develop a will of its own a will that is in conflict with ours
1575,Others believe that humans can command the rate of technology for a decently long time and that the potential of AI to solve many of the worlds problems will be realised
1576,Although I am well known as an optimist regarding the human race I am not so sure
1577,In the near term for example world militaries are considering starting an arms race in autonomous weapon systems that can choose and eliminate their own targets
1578,While the UN is debating a treaty banning such weapons autonomousweapons proponents usually forget to ask the most important question
1579,In the medium term AI may automate our jobs to bring both great prosperity and equality
1580,There is no physical law precluding particles from being organised in ways that perform even more advanced computations than the arrangements of particles in human brains
1581,An explosive transition is possible although it may play out differently than in the movies
1582,One can imagine such technology outsmarting financial markets outinventing human researchers outmanipulating human leaders and potentially subduing us with weapons we cannot even understand
1583,In short t he advent of superintelligent AI would be either the best or the worst thing ever to happen to humanity
1584,A superintelligent AI will be extremely good ataccomplishing its goals and if those goals arent aligned with ours were in trouble
1585,Lets not place humanity in the position of those ants
1586,Little serious research has been devoted to these issues outside a few small nonprofit institutes
1587,Technology pioneers Bill Gates Steve Wozniak and Elon Musk have echoed my concerns and a healthy culture of risk assessment and awareness of societal implications is beginning to take root in the AI community
1588,In January  I along with Elon Musk and many AI experts signed an open letter on artificial intelligence calling for serious research into its impact on society
1589,In the past Elon Musk has warned that superhuman artificial intelligence is capable of providing incalculable benefits but if deployed incautiously will have an adverse effect on the human race
1590,In addition for policymakers and the general public the letter was meant to be informative but not alarmist
1591,We think it is very important that everybody knows that AI researchers are seriously thinking about these concerns and ethical issues
1592,For example AI has the potential to eradicate disease and poverty but researchers must work to create AI that can be controlled
1593,The Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence is a multidisciplinary institute dedicated to researching the future of intelligence as crucial to the future of our civilisation and our species
1594,So its awelcome change that people are studying instead the future of intelligence
1595,We are aware of the potential dangers but perhaps with the tools of this new technological revolution we will even be able to undo some of the damage done to the natural world by industrialisation
1596,Recent developments in the advancement of AI include a call by the European Parliament for drafting a set of regulations to govern the creation of robots and AI
1597,A European Parliament spokesman has commented that as a growing number of areas in our daily lives are increasingly affected by robots we need to ensure that robots are and will remain in the service of humans
1598,A report presented to the Parliament declares that the world is on the cusp of a new industrial robot revolution
1599,It examines whether or not providing legal rights for robots as electronic persons on a par with the legal definition of corporate personhood would be permissible
1600,But it stresses that at all times researchers and designers should ensure all robotic design incorporates a kill switch
1601,This didnt help the scientists on board the spaceship with Hal the malfunctioning robotic computer in Stanley Kubricks   A Space Odyssey  but that was fiction
1602,Lorna Brazell a consultant at the multinational law firm Osborne Clarke says in the report that we dont give whales and gorillas personhood so there is no need to jump at robotic personhood
1603,The report acknowledges the possibility that within a few decades AI could surpass human intellectual capacity and challenge the humanrobot relationship
1604,By  there will be about thirty megacities each with more than ten million inhabitants
1605,But to revolutionise shopping they need to be fast enough to allow sameday delivery on every order
1606,Opportunities for interacting with the world without having to be physically present are increasing rapidly
1607,As you can imagine I find that appealing not least because city life for all of us is so busy
1608,But in fact the more we can do the busier we become
1609,It could be really excitingdigital actors that would be forever young and able to perform otherwise impossible feats
1610,In the smartest cities the smartest homes will be equipped with devices that are so intuitive theyll be almost effortless to interact with
1611,Nearly  years later and touch screens have unlocked new ways to communicate with the digital world
1612,In the coming decades it will permeate every aspect of our society intelligently supporting and advising us in many reas including healthcare work education and science
1613,Perhaps with the tools of this new technological revolution we can make human life better
1614,For instance researchers are developing AI that would help reverse paralysis in people with spinalcord injuries
1615,Using silicon chip implants and wireless electronic interfaces between the brain and the body the technology would allow people to control their body movements with their thoughts
1616,There are two ways electrodes on the skull and implants
1617,The first is like looking through frosted glass the second is better but risks infection
1618,If we can connect a human brain to the internet it will have all of Wikipedia as its resource
1619,The world has been changing even faster as people devices and information are increasingly connected to each other
1620,Computational power is growing and quantum computing is quickly being realised
1621,There is already one technique to edit DNA precisely called CRISPR
1622,The basis of this genomeediting technology is a bacterial defence system
1623,It can accurately target and edit stretches of genetic code
1624,The best intention of genetic manipulation is that modifying genes would allow scientists to treat genetic causes of disease by correcting gene mutations
1625,We cant see the possibilities of curing motor neurone diseaseslike my ALSwithout also glimpsing its dangers
1626,Intelligence is characterised as the ability to adapt to change
1627,Human intelligence is the result of generations of natural selection of those with the ability to adapt to changed circumstances
1628,We stand on the threshold of a brave new world
1629,It is an exciting if precarious place to be and we are the pioneers
1630,With more powerful technologies such as nuclear weapons synthetic biology and strong artificial intelligence we should instead plan ahead and aim to get things right the first time because it may be theonly chance we will get
1631,We are still finding awesome confirmations of his predictions like the gravitational waves observed in  by the LIGO experiment
1632,Einstein had the ability to look beyond the surface to reveal the underlying structure
1633,He was undaunted by common sense the idea that things must be the way they seemed
1634,He had the courage to pursue ideas that seemed absurd to others
1635,And this set him free to be ingenious a genius of his time and every other
1636,Many of his discoveries came from his ability to reimagine the universe through thought experiments
1637,That image ultimately led to the theory of special relativity
1638,One hundred years later physicists know far more about the universe than Einstein did
1639,Now we have greater tools for discovery such as particle accelerators supercomputers space telescopes and experiments such as the LIGO labs work on gravitational waves
1640,We can witness natures most exotic phenomena while driving in a car snoozing in bed or pretending to listen to someone boring at a party
1641,In thosedays it was more straightforward to take something apart and figure out the mechanics
1642,I was not always successful in reassembling toys I had pulled to pieces but I think I learned more than a boy or girl today would if he or she tried the same trick on a smartphone
1643,I have worked with some of the greatest scientists in the world
1644,It can conceive of the magnificence of the heavens and the intricacies of the basic components of matter
1645,Yet for each mind to achieve its full potential it needs a spark
1646,I wasnt the easiest person to teach I was slow to learn to read and my handwriting was untidy
1647,He opened my eyes to maths as the blueprint of the universe itself
1648,If you look behind every exceptional person there is an exceptional teacher
1649,Due to the recent global financial crisis and austerity measures funding is being significantly cut to all areas of science but in particular the fundamental sciences have been badly affected
1650,At the level of research the exchange of people across borders enables skills to transfer more quickly and brings new people with different ideas derived from their different backgrounds
1651,The basis for the future of education must lie in schools and inspiring teachers
1652,Most people respond to a qualitative rather than a quantitative understanding without the need for complicated equations
1653,Popular science books and articles can also put across ideas about the way we live
1654,Science documentaries and films reach a mass audience but it is only oneway communication
1655,Today through theoretical work and experimental triumphs such as the Large Hadron Collider and the discovery of the Higgs boson cosmology has opened the universe up to us
1656,There are big questions still to answer and much work lies ahead
1657,But we know more now and have achieved more in this relatively short space of time than anyone could have imagined
1658,They need to know about science more than any before them because it is part of their daily lives in an unprecedented way
1659,Without speculating too wildly there are trends we can see and emerging problems that we know must be dealt with now and into the future
1660,Among the problems I count global warming finding space and resources for the massive increase in the Earths human population rapid extinction of other species the need to develop renewable energy sources the degradation of the oceans deforestation and epidemic diseasesjust to name a few
1661,There is such enormous scope for innovation in every area of life
1662,Some think that humanity today is the pinnacle of evolution and that this is as good as it gets
1663,Our physical resources are being drained at an alarming rate
1664,Mankind has presented our planet with the disastrous gifts of climate change pollution rising temperatures reduction of the polar ice caps deforestation and decimation of animal species
1665,Faced with these figures it is clear this nearexponential population growth cannot continue into the next millennium
1666,Another reason to consider colonising another planet is the possibility of nuclear war
1667,We now have the technological power to destroy every living creature on Earth
1668,As we have seen in recent events in North Korea this is a sobering and worrying thought
1669,But I believe we can avoid this potential for Armageddon and one of the best ways for us to do this is to move out into space and explore the potential for humans to live on other planets
1670,Recent landmarks such as selfdriving cars a computer winning the game of Go and the arrival of digital personal assistants Siri Google Now andCortana are merely symptoms of an IT arms race fuelled by unprecedented investments and building on an increasingly mature theoretical foundation
1671,But the advent of superintelligent AI would be either the best or the worst thing ever to happen to humanity
1672,We cannot know if we will be infinitely helped by AI or ignored by it and sidelined or conceivably destroyed by it
1673,As an optimist I believe that we can create AI for the good of the world that it can work in harmony with us
1674,We simply need to be aware of the dangers identify them employ the best possible practice and management and prepare for its consequences well in advance
1675,I have benefited from assisted technology to give me a voice that my illness has taken away
1676,I was lucky to lose my voice at the beginning of the personal computing age
1677,Over these years the world and technologys impact on it has changed dramatically
1678,Technology has changed the way we all live our lives from communication to genetic research to access to information and much much more
1679,As technology has got smarter it has opened doors to possibilities that I didnt ever predict
1680,It is often a proving ground for the technology of the future
1681,Voice to text text to voice home automation drive by wire even the Segway were developed for the disabled years before they were in everyday use
1682,These technological achievements are due to the spark of fire within ourselves the creative force
1683,This creativity can take many forms from physical achievement to theoretical physics
1684,Brain interfaces could make this means of communicationused by more and more peoplequicker and more expressive
1685,I now use Facebookit allows me to speak directly to my friends and followers worldwide so they can keep up with my latest theories and see pictures from my travels
1686,In the same way that the internet our mobile phones medical imaging satellite navigation and social networks would have been incomprehensible to the society of only a few generations ago our future world will be equally transformed in ways we are only beginning to conceive
1687,Information on its own will not take us there but its intelligent and creative use will
1688,There is so much more to come and I hope that this prospect offers great inspiration to schoolchildren today
1689,And I believe the future of learning and education is the internet
1690,In a way the internet connects us all together like the neurons in a giant brain
1691,I am not promoting the idea that all young people should grow up to be scientists
1692,I do not see that as an ideal situation as the world needs people with a wide variety of skills
1693,They need to be scientifically literate and inspired to engage with developments in science and technology in order to learn more
1694,I seriously doubt whether longrange beneficial projects such as cleaning up the oceans or curing diseases in the developing world would be given priority
1695,Worse we could find that technology is used against us and that we might have no power to stop it
1696,We stand at a threshold of important discoveries in all areas of science
1697,Without doubt our world will change enormously in the next fifty years
1698,While the chances of communicating with an intelligent extraterrestrial species may be slim the importance of such a discovery means we must not give up trying
1699,We will continue to explore our cosmic habitat sending robots and humans into space
1700,We cannot continue to look inwards at ourselves on a small and increasingly polluted and overcrowded planet
1701,Through scientific endeavour and technological innovation we must look outwards to the wider universe while also striving to fix the problems on Earth
1702,And I am optimistic that we will ultimately create viable habitats for the human race on other planets
1703,We will transcend the Earth and learn to exist in space
1704,Opening up the thrill and wonder of scientific discovery creating innovative and accessible ways to reach out to the widest young audience possible greatly increases the chances of finding and inspiring the new Einstein
1705,So remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet
1706,I would like to see the development of fusion power to give an unlimited supply of clean energy and a switch to electric cars
1707,Nuclear fusion would become a practical power source and would provide us with an inexhaustible supply of energy without pollution or global warming
1708,Cambridge looked empty not even a wandering tourist in sight
1709,The only spikes of colour came from the blue flashing lights of the police motorcycle outriders guarding the hearse with my fathers coffin in it stopping the sparse traffic as we went
1710,And saw the crowds massed along one of the most recognisable streets in the world Kings Parade the heart of Cambridge itself
1711,With banners flags cameras and mobile phones held aloft the huge numbers of people lining the streets stood in quiet respect as the head porter of Gonville and Caius my fathers Cambridge college dressed ceremonially in his bowler hat and carrying an ebony cane walked solemnly along the street to meet the hearse and walk it to the church
1712,My aunt squeezed my hand as we both burst into tears
1713,Since my father died there has been so much he would have loved so much I wish he could have known
1714,I wish he could have seen the extraordinary outpouring of affection towards him coming from all around the world
1715,I wish he had known he would be interred in Westminster Abbey between two of his scientific heroes Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin and that as he was laid to rest in the earth his voice would be beamed by a radio telescope towards a black hole
1716,One phrase in this book jumped off the page at me as summing up his attitude to himself if I have made a contribution
1717,Both in the overarching grandeur of his work in cosmology exploring the structure and origins of the universe itself and in his completely human bravery and humour in the face of his challenges
1718,He found a way to reach beyond the limits of knowledge while surpassing the limits of endurance at the same time
1719,It was effortful for him to communicatebut he made that effort constantly adapting his equipment as he further lost mobility
1720,My father was also a family man a fact lost on most people until the film  The Theory of Everything  came out in
1721,As a small child I intensely disliked the way strangers felt free to stare at us sometimes with open mouths as my father piloted his wheelchair at insane speeds through Cambridge accompanied by two mophaired blond children often running alongside while trying to eat an ice cream
1722,I used to try to stare back but I dont think my indignation ever hit the target especially not from a childish face smeared with melted lolly
1723,It wasnt by any stretch of the imagination a normal childhood
1724,I knew thatand yet at the same time I didnt
1725,My brother and I attended some of the lecturespresumably to give my mother a break from her wraparound caring duties
1726,In those days physics lectures were not popular and definitely not for kids
1727,I sat there doodling on my notepad but my brother put his skinny littleboy arm in the air and asked a question of the distinguished academic presenter while my father glowed with pride
1728,As time dulls the raw grief I have reflected that it could take me for ever to process our experiences
1729,In a way Im not even sure I want to
1730,Sometimes I just want to hold on to the last words my father said to me that I had been a lovely daughter and that I should be unafraid
1731,And that trying might turn out to be the most important part of courage
1732,My father never gave up he never shied away from the fight
1733,At the age of seventyfive completely paralysed and able to move only a few facial muscles he still got up every day put on a suit and went to work
1734,He had stuff to do and was not going to let a few trivialities get in his way
1735,His idea was to bring his contemporary writings together into one volume
1736,Like so many things that have happened since he died I wish he could have seenthe final version
1737,I think he would have been very proud of this book and even he might have had to admit in the end that he had made a contribution after all

1739,Stephen Hawking was well known for his scientific and creative collaborations throughout his career from working with colleagues on groundbreaking science papers to collaborating with script writers such as the team from  The Simpsons
1740,In his later years Stephen needed increasing levels of support from those around him both technically and in terms of communication assistance
1741,By Stephen Hawking A Brief History of Time Black Holes and Baby Universes and Other Essays The Illustrated A Brief History of Time The Universe in a Nutshell A Briefer History of Time  with Leonard Mlodinow The Grand Design  with Leonard Mlodinow My Brief History Brief Answers to the Big Questions FOR CHILDREN Georges Secret Key to the Universe  with Lucy Hawking Georges Cosmic Treasure Hunt  with Lucy Hawking George and the Big Bang  with Lucy Hawking George and the Unbreakable Code  with Lucy Hawking George and the Blue Moon  with Lucy HawkingAbout the Author S TEPHEN   H AWKING  was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge for thirty years and the recipient of numerous awards and honors including the Presidential Medal of Freedom
1742,His books for the general reader include  My Brief History  the classic  A Brief History of Time  the essay collection  Black Holes and Baby Universes The Universe in a Nutshell  and with Leonard Mlodinow  A Briefer History of Time  and  The Grand Design
1743,He also coauthored a series of childrens books with his daughter beginning with  Georges Secret Key to the Universe
1744,DS White dwarfs and neutron stars  have exhausted  their fuel so they have shrunk to become some  of the densest objects in the universe
1745,And that if one neglected pressure a uniform spherically systematic symmetric  star would contract to a single point of infinite density
1746,This  concept has been a defining theme in Stephen Hawkings career
1747,It refers  to the end of  a star but also something more fundamental  that a singularity was the starting point for the  formation of the entire universe
1748,It was  Hawkings mathematical work on  this that earned him  global recognition
1749,DS Einsteins Theory of General Relativity says tha t obje cts distort the space time around them
1750,Picture a bowling ball lying on a trampoline changing the shape of the material and causing  smaller  objects to slide towar ds it
1751,But if the curves in  spacetime  become deeper an d deeper and eventually infinite the usual rules of space and time no  longer apply
1752,Most sci entists including Robert Oppen heimer switched their  attention to nuclear physics and the issue of gravitational collapse was largely forgotten
1753,Interest in the subject revived with the discovery of distant objects called quasars
1754,DS Quasars are the br ightest objects in the unive rse and possibly the most distant detected so far
1755,The name is short for quasi stellar radio sources and they are believed to be discs of matter  swirling around black holes
1756,Nuclear processes could not account for  their energy output because they release only a percent fraction of their rest mass as pure  energy
1757,The only alternative was gravitational energy r eleased by gravitational collapse
1758,It was clear that a uniform spherical star  would contract to a point of infinite density a singularity
1759,This means at this point of infinite  density one cant predict the future
1760,We wouldnt be affected by the breakdown of predict ion if the singularities  are not naked  that is they are not shielded from the outside
1761,It suggested something dark and mysterious But the French  being French saw a  more risque  meaning
1762,For yea rs they resisted the name trou noi r claiming it was obscene
1763,But that was a bit like trying to stand against  Le Week end and ot her Franglais
1764,You can throw television sets  diamond rings or even your worst enemies into a black hole and al l the black hole will  remember is the total mass and the state of rotation
1765,John Wheeler is known for   expressing this principle as a black hole has no h air
1766,A black hole has a boundary called the event horizon
1767,Because nothing can travel faster than  light everything else will get dragged back also
1768,Falling through the even t horizon is a bit like  going over Niagara Falls in a canoe
1769,If you are above the falls you can get away if you paddle  fast enough but once you are over the edge you are lost
1770,As you get  nearer the falls the current gets faster
1771,Th is means it pulls harder on the front of the canoe  than the back
1772,Theres a danger that the canoe will be pulled apart
1773,If you fall towards a black hole feet first gravity will pull harder on your feet than  your head bec ause they are nearer the black hole
1774,The result is you will be stretched out longwise and squashed in sideways
1775,If the black hole  has a mass of a few times our sun  you would be torn  apart and made into spaghetti  before  you reached the horizon
1776,So if you want to  explore the inside of a black hole make sure you choose a big one
1777,There is a black hole  with a mass of about four million times that of the sun at the centre of our Milky Way  galaxy
1778,Although you wouldnt notice anything particular as you fell into a black hole someone  watching you from a distance would never see you cross the event horizon
1779,Instead you  would appear to slow down and hover just outside
1780,Your image would get dimmer and  dimmer and redder and redder until you were effectively lost from sight
1781,As far as the  outside world is concerned you would be lost for ever
1782,There was a  dramatic advance in our understandin g of these mysterious phenomena  with a  mathematical discovery in
1783,These properties suggest that there is a resemblance between the area of the event horizon of a black hole and conventional Newtonian physics  specifically the concept of entropy in thermodynamics
1784,Entropy can be re garded as a  measure of the disorder of a system or equivalently as a lack of knowledge of its precise  state
1785,The famous second law of thermodynamics says that entropy always increases with  time
1786,This discovery was the first hint of this crucial connectio n
1787,DS Entropy  means the tendency for anything that has order to become more disordered as time  passes  so for example bricks neatly stacked to form a wall low entropy will eventually end up in  an untid y heap  of dust  high entropy
1788,And this process is described by the second law of  thermodynamics
1789,Apart  from these three properties the black hole pres erves no other details of the object that  collapsed
1790,His theorem has implications for information in the cosmologists sense of information the  idea that every particle and every force in the universe has an implicit answer to a yes no  question
1791,DS Information  in this context means all the details of every particle and force associated wi th an  object
1792,And  the more disordered something is   the higher its entropy  the more information is  needed to describe it
1793,As the physicist and broadcaster Jim A lKhalili puts it a well shuffled pack of  cards has higher entropy and therefore needs far more explanation or information than an  unshuffled one
1794,The theorem implies that a large amount of information is lost in a gravitational collapse
1795,For example  the final black hole state is independent of whether the body that collapsed  was composed of matter or antimatter or whether it was spherical or highly irregular in  shape
1796,In other words a black hole of  a given mass angular momentum  and electric charg e  could have been formed by the collapse of any one of a large number of different  configurations of matter
1797,Indeed if quantum effects  are neglected  the number of configurations would be infinite since the black hole could have been formed  by the collapse of a cloud of an indefinitely large number of particles of indefinitely low mass
1798,But could the number of co nfigurations really be infinite     The uncertainty  principle of quantum mechanics  implies that only particles with a  wavelength smaller tha n that of the black hole itself  could form a black hole
1799,That means the  wavelength would be limited it could not be infinite
1800,It therefore appears that the number of configurations that could form a black hole of  a  given mass angular momentum  and electric charge although very large may also be finite
1801,Jacob Bekenst ein suggested that from this finite number one could interpret the entropy of  a black hole
1802,This would imply that a  black hole could be in equilibrium with thermal radiation at some temperature other than  zero
1803,Yet according to classical concepts no such equilibrium is possible since the black  hole would absorb any thermal radiation that fell on it but by definition would not be able  to emit anything in re turn
1804,DS So Stephen Hawking has taken us on a scientific journey from Einsteins claim that stars could  not collapse to the acceptance of the reality o f black holes to a  collisio n of theories over h ow these  weird features exist and function
1805,The second lecture will bring us  up to date with the latest thinking on black holes and will ask  us to  change the way we think of them
1806,ukreithlectures               Transcript of audience Q and A after the first lecture   SUE LAWLEY Thank you
1807,Weve chosen a representative selection of topics and invited some of those listeners to  come and put their questions in person
1808,Youll appreciate audience that we had to give  Stephen the questions beforehand so that he could programme his answers into his  computer
1809,This is done letter by letter  through the movement of his facial muscles and  youll hear little tiny bleeps as the infrared detector picks up those movements
1810,Its not a  speedy process round about a word a minute but the answers are all in there now
1811,Do you see ways to change th at situation using the  many and varied observations now rou tinely being made of accreting black holes throughout  the cosmos   SUE LAWLEY  Stephen   STEPHEN HAWKING  I assume you are referring to the area increase law for black hole  horizons
1812,The best way of testing this is black hole collisions rather than accretio n
1813,SUE LAWLEY Well you got pretty short shrift there I have to say
1814,Accretion is just matter dribbling into the black hole  steadily and it produces enormous amounts of energy release very luminous things in the  universe
1815,Theyre pupils from Barr Beacon Secondary School in Walsall and  theyre aged around  or
1816,And they were so keen to know more because first ly theyve  seen him in The Big Bang Theory laughter    SUE LAWLEY This is the television  the American sitcom  KATE HARRIS Yes
1817,laughter    APPLAUSE   SUE LAWLEY Well maybe it was because I explained it to you
1818,laughter Now to a rather  more personal question  and we r eceived many of them actually
1819,You told us Duncan that Stephen had  been an inspiration to you
1820,SUE LAWLEY You mean the film The Theory of Everything    DUNCAN McKINNON Yeah yeah
1821,You probably know this already because  theres been a movie about it
1822,Although I was unfor tunate to get motor neurone disease I have been very  fortunate in almost everything else
1823,SUE LAWLEY We have here Lucy Hawking Stephens daughter just towards the front  there
1824,Lucy you have se en Stephen over the past four decades if you dont mind my saying  that
1825,But not just to keep going for the  purposes of survival but to transcend this by produc ing extraordinary work writing books  giving lectures inspiring other people with neurodegenerative and other disabilities and  being a family man a friend and a colleague to so many  so many people and keeping up  with friends across the world
1826,LUCY HAWKING I think that was his way of asking me to stop talking
1827,Theres an archive of recordings and  transcripts going back to  so do have a look
1828,For now our thanks to our hosts here at the Royal Institution in London and of course huge  thanks to our Reith Lecturer Professor Stephen Hawking
1829,THIS TRANSCRIPT IS ISSUED ON THE UNDERSTANDING THAT IT IS TAKEN FROM A LIVE PROGRAMME  AS IT WAS BROADCAST
1830,THE NATURE OF LIVE BROADCASTING MEANS THAT NEITHER THE BBC NOR  THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE PROGRAMME CAN GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY OF THE INFORMATION  HERE
1831,ukreithlectures             Since that time the mathematical evidence that bla ck holes emit thermal radiation  has been  confirmed by a number of other people with various different approaches
1832,One way to  understand the emission is as fol lows
1833,DS This concept  hinges on the idea that a vacuum is never totally empty
1834,And this would always involve  pairs of particles with opposite  characteristics  appearing and disappearing
1835,These particles are called virtual because unlike real particles  they cannot be observed  directly with a particle detector
1836,DS The key here is that the formation and disappearance of these particles norm ally passes  unnoticed
1837,But if the process  happens right on the edge of a black hole one of the pair may get  dragged in while the other is not
1838,The particle that  escapes would then look as if its  being spat out  by the black hole
1839,A black hole of the mass of the sun would leak particles at such a slow rate it would be  impossible to detect
1840,A mountain sized black hole would give off x rays and g amma rays at a  rate of about ten million m egawatts enough to power the worlds electricity supply
1841,You couldnt keep it in a power  station because it would drop through the floor  and end up at the centre of the Earth
1842,If we  had such a black hole about the only way to keep hold of it  would be to have it in orbit  around the Earth
1843,People have searched for mini black holes of this mass but have so far not found any
1844,This  is  a pity because if they had  I would have got a Nobel Prize
1845,DS By extra dimensions  he means something beyond the three dimension s that we are all fami liar  with in our everyday lives  plus the fourth dimension of time
1846,According to some theor ies the universe we experience  is just a four dimensional surface  in  a ten or eleven dimensiona l space
1847,We wouldnt see t hese extra dimensions  because light wouldnt propagate through  them but only through the four dimensions of our universe
1848,This would make it  much easier to form a lit tle black hole in the extra dimensions
1849,It might be possible to  observe this at the LHC th e Large Hadron Collider at CERN  in Switzerland
1850,Two beams of particles travel round this tunnel in  opposite  directions and are made to collide
1851,These would radiate particles in a pattern that  would be easy to recognize
1852,It was a triumph of s cience and engineering of clever theory  and hardwon evidence
1853,A nd Peter Higgs and Francois Englert  a Belgian scientist were jointly  awarded the prize
1854,No physical proof has yet been found of Hawking Radiation
1855,As particles escape from a black hole the hole will lose mass and shrink
1856,Eventually the black hole will lose all its mass and  disappear
1857,But if information is lost this raises a serious problem that strikes at the heart  of our understanding of science
1858,For more than  years we have believed in scientific determinism that is that the laws of  science determine the evolution of the universe
1859,I  dont think that Laplace  was claiming that God  didnt exist
1860,It is just that h e doesnt  intervene to break the laws of s cience
1861,In Laplace s determinism one needed to know the positions a nd speeds of all particles at  one time in order to predict the future
1862,This holds that the more accurately you know the posi tions of particles the less accurately  you can know their speeds and vice versa
1863,In other words you cant know both the  positions and the speeds accurately
1864,We would still expect the universe  to be deterministic in the se nse that if we knew the quantum state of the universe at one  time the laws of science should enable us to predict it at any other time
1865,Essentially information entering a black hole should be destroy ed  according to Einsteins Theor y of General Relativity while quantum theory says  it cannot be broken  down and this remains an unresolved question
1866,If information were lost in black holes we wouldnt be able to predict the future because a  black hole  could emit any collection of particles
1867,It could emit a worki ng television set or a  leather bound volume of the complete works of Shakespeare though the chance of such  exotic emissions is very low
1868,If determinism the predictability of the universe breaks down with  black holes it could break down in other situations
1869,Even worse if determinism breaks  down we cant be sure of our past history either
1870,The history books and our memories  could just be illusions
1871,It was therefore very important to determine whet her information really was lost in black  holes or whether in principle it could be recovered
1872,It depen ds on  the idea of Richard Fey nman that there isnt a single history but many different possible  histories each with their own probability
1873,The point is  that from the outside one cant be certai n whether there is a black hole  or not
1874,So there is always a chance that there isnt a black hole
1875,This poss ibility is enough to  preserve the information but the information is not returned in a very useful form
1876,Information is not lost if you keep all the smoke and ashes but it  is difficult to read
1877,The scientist Kip Thor ne and I  had a bet with another physicist John  Preskill that information would be lost in black holes
1878,DS In theory and with a purely deterministic view of the universe y ou could burn an encyclopaedia   and then reconstitute it  if you knew the characteristics and position of every atom making up every  molecule of ink in every letter  and kept track of them all at all times
1879,The  information is encoded on the horizon of the black hole
1880,The theory  hinges on information being transformed into a two dimensional hologram in a process  known as supertranslation s
1881,The paper titled Soft H air on Black Holes offers a highly revealing  glimpse into  the esoteric  language of this field   and the  challenge that scientists  face in trying to explain it
1882,The hole would need to be large and if it was rotating it might have a passage  to another universe
1883,So although Im keen on  space flight Im not going to try that
1884,DS If black holes are rotating then their heart may not consist of a singularity in the sense of an  infinitely dense point
1885,Instead there may be a singularity in the form of a ring
1886,And t hat leads to  speculation abou t the possibility of not only falling  into a black hole but also travelling through one
1887,This would mean leaving the universe  as we know it
1888,And  Stephen Hawking concludes with a   tantalising thought  that there may something on the other side
1889,The message of this le cture  is that black holes aint as black as they are painted
1890,They are  not the eternal prisons they were once thought
1891,Things can get out of a black hole bo th to  the outside and possibly to another universe
1892,So  if you feel you are in a black hole dont  give up
1893,ukreithlectures               Transcript of audience Q and A after the second  lecture     SUE LAWLEY Professor Hawking thank you very much indeed
1894,So weve been taken on a trip to the  outer regions of the universe to the brink of human understanding and beyond
1895,Listeners have sent  in hundreds of questions for the professor and some of them are here with us now in the lecture  theatre of the Royal Institution in London t o put their questions in person
1896,Your question please Marie     MARIE GRIFFITHS Did the Big Bang start just one universe or all the multiverses     SUE LAWLEY Stephen     STEPHEN HAWKING Some theories about the Big Bang allow for the creation of a very large and  complex universe maybe even many universes
1897,Our connected component of space time is all we can know
1898,He couldnt unfortunately get here today but let me  put his question to you for him Stephen
1899,Galileo was the first person to challenge the received wisdom that the  ancient Greeks and Aristotle in particular wer e the ultimate authority in science
1900,This must have been seen by many people but they had put it down to imperfect  observati ons or other reasons
1901,But Galileo said the ancients were actually wrong and started to  work out the correct laws from the observations
1902,He  followed his nose and was a bit of a rebel
1903,Right Im going to come to Dara OBriain  over here on the right
1904,He studied pure mathematics  and theoretical physics at University College Dublin in preparation for his c areer as a stand up comic
1905,laughter So youre an expert are you Dara on both physics and humour     DARA OBRIAIN Yes yeah we overlap in some ways
1906,Given that Stephen has appeared twice in The  Simpsons he has a more successful comedy career than I do
1907,I had the pleasure this year of meeting him and having it  autographed as it were and spending some time with Stephen this year
1908,DARA OBRIAIN Well actually given the chance I turned the opportunity of this question over to  some physicists I know  in pa rticular Jim Al Khalili
1909,Professor Jim Al Khalili wanted to ask a question  from within the scientific community
1910,laughter But theres another kind of Hawking radiation coming from the  cosmological event horizon of the early inflationary universe
1911,Im now studying whether one might  detect Hawking radiation in primordial gravitat ional waves
1912,SUE LAWLEY laughter A new kind of Hawking radiation then from light years earlier
1913,Chris Cooke a  year old product des igner from Crawley in Sussex
1914,Chris  studied mechanical engineering so hes always been interested in physics
1915,In his spare time he does  stand up comedy Dara despite my introverted  laughter despite my introverted personality  traits he says
1916,Chris  your question     CHRIS COOKE Do you feel that using a speech device to communicate has changed your personality  in any way As an introvert has it made you more extroverted     SUE LAWLEY Stephen     STEPHEN HAWKING Well I am not sure I have ever been called  an introvert before
1917,laughter Just  because I spend a lot of time thinking doesnt mean I dont like parties and getting into trouble
1918,laughter I enjoy communicating and I enjoy giving popular lectures about science
1919,My speech  synthesizer has been very  important for this even though I ended up with an American accent
1920,laughter Before I lost my voice my speech was slurred so only those close to me could  understand but with the computer voice I found I could talk to everyone without help
1921,So it has  allowed me to express my personality rather than changing it
1922,Your question Patrick     PATRICK DONAGUE Professor Haw king do you think the world will end naturally or will man destroy  it first     SUE LAWLEY Professor Hawking just a small question
1923,laughter     STEPHEN HAWKING We face a number of threats to our survival from nuclear war catastrophic  global warming and g enetically engineered viruses
1924,The number is likely to increase in the future  with the development of new technologies and new ways things can go wrong
1925,Although the chance  of a disaster to planet Earth in a given year may be quite low it adds up over t ime and becomes a  near certainty in the next thousand or ten thousand years
1926,By that time we should have spread out  into space and to other stars so a disaster on Earth would not mean the end of the human race
1927,laughter Most of the threats we face come from the  progress we have made in science and technology
1928,We are not going to stop making progress or  reve rse it so we have to recognize the dangers and control them
1929,SUE LAWLEY Well I dont know about the world but were definitely running out of time
1930,From my own perspective it has been a glorious time to be alive and doing  research in theoretical physics
1931,There is nothi ng like the Eureka moment of discovering something  that no one knew before
1932,We live in a universe governed by rational laws that we can discover and understand
1933,Despi te recent triumphs there are many new and deep mysteries that remain for you to solve
1934,But you also  must remember that science and technology are changing our world dr amatically so its important  to ensure that these changes are heading in the right directions
1935,In a democratic society this means  that everyone needs to have a basic understanding of science to make informed decisions about the  future
1936,For now from the Royal Institution in London our thanks to the BBC Reith Lecturer Professor  Stephen Hawking
1937,APPLAUSE       THIS TRANSCRIPT IS ISSUED ON THE UNDERSTANDING THAT IT IS TAKEN FROM A LIVE PROGRAMME  AS IT WAS BROADCAST
1938,THE NATURE OF LIVE BROADCASTING MEANS THAT NEITHER THE BBC NOR  THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE PROGRAMME CAN GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY OF THE INFORMATION  HERE
1939,ukreithlectures                       future or have we but I discuss a possible explanation for this
1940,I also describe the progress that has been made recently in finding dualities or correspondences betweenapparently different theories of physics
1941,These correspondences are a strong indication that there is a completeunified theory of physics but they also suggest that it may not be possible to express this theory in a singlefundamental formulation
1942,Instead we may have to use different reflections of the underlying theory in differentsituations
1943,It might be like our being unable to represent the surface of the earth on a single map and having touse different maps in different regions
1944,This would be a revolution in our view of the unification of the laws ofscience but it would not change the most important point that the universe is governed by a set of rational lawsthat we can discover and understand
1945,On the observational side by far the most important development has been the measurement of fluctuations inthe cosmic microwave background radiation by COBE the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite and othercollaborations
1946,These fluctuations are the fingerprints of creation tiny initial irregularities in the otherwisesmooth and uniform early universe that later grew into galaxies stars and all the structures we see around us
1947,Their form agrees with the predictions of the proposal that the universe has no boundaries or edges in theimaginary time direction but further observations will be necessary to distinguish this proposal from otherpossible explanations for the fluctuations in the background
1948,Stephen Hawking  A Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking fileCWINDOWSDesktopblahhStephen Hawking  A brief history of timeA Brief History in Time
1949,html  of    AMCHAPTER  OUR PICTURE OF THE UNIVERSE   A wellknown scientist some say it was Bertrand Russell once gave a public lecture on astronomy
1950,The world is really a flat plate supported on the back of a gianttortoise
1951,Youre veryclever young man very clever said the old lady
1952,Someday these answers may seem as obvious to us as the earth orbiting the sun  orperhaps as ridiculous as a tower of tortoises
1953,As long ago as  BC the Greek philosopher Aristotle in his book On the Heavens was able to put forward two good arguments for believing that the earth was a round sphere rather than a Hat plate
1954,First he realizedthat eclipses of the moon were caused by the earth coming between the sun and the moon
1955,Sincethe North Star lies over the North Pole it appears to be directly above an observer at the North Pole but tosomeone looking from the equator it appears to lie just at the horizon
1956,From the difference in the apparentposition of the North Star in Egypt and Greece Aristotle even quoted an estimate that the distance around theearth was  stadia
1957,He believed this because he felt for mystical reasons that the earth was thecenter of the universe and that circular motion was the most perfect
1958,This idea was elaborated by Ptolemy inthe second century AD into a complete cosmological model
1959,The earth stood at the center surrounded by eightspheres that carried the moon the sun the stars and the five planets known at the time Mercury VenusMars Jupiter and Saturn
1960,html  of    AMFigure  The planets themselves moved on smaller circles attached to their respective spheres in order to account fortheir rather complicated observed paths in the sky
1961,Ptolemys model provided a reasonably accurate system for predicting the positions of heavenly bodies in thesky
1962,But in order to predict these positions correctly Ptolemy had to make an assumption that the moonfollowed a path that sometimes brought it twice as close to the earth as at other times
1963,And that meant that themoon ought sometimes to appear twice as big as at other times Ptolemy recognized this flaw but neverthelesshis model was generally although not universally accepted
1964,It was adopted by the Christian church as thepicture of the universe that was in accordance with Scripture for it had the great advantage that it left lots ofroom outside the sphere of fixed stars for heaven and hell
1965,At first perhaps forfear of being branded a heretic by his church Copernicus circulated his model anonymously
1966,His idea was thatthe sun was stationary at the center and that the earth and the planets moved in circular orbits around the sun
1967,Nearly a century passed before this idea was taken seriously
1968,Then two astronomers  the German JohannesA Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
1969,html  of    AMKepler and the Italian Galileo Galilei  started publicly to support the Copernican theory despite the fact thatthe orbits it predicted did not quite match the ones observed
1970,This implied that everything did not have to orbit directly around theearth as Aristotle and Ptolemy had thought
1971,It was of course still possible to believe that the earth wasstationary at the center of the universe and that the moons of Jupiter moved on extremely complicated pathsaround the earth giving the appearance that they orbited Jupiter
1972,At the same time Johannes Kepler had modified Copernicuss theory suggesting that the planetsmoved not in circles but in ellipses an ellipse is an elongated circle
1973,As far as Kepler was concerned elliptical orbits were merely an ad hoc hypothesis and a rather repugnant oneat that because ellipses were clearly less perfect than circles
1974,Having discovered almost by accident thatelliptical orbits fit the observations well he could not reconcile them with his idea that the planets were made toorbit the sun by magnetic forces
1975,It was this same force that caused objects to fall to the ground
1976,The story that Newton was inspiredby an apple hitting his head is almost certainly apocryphal
1977,All Newton himself ever said was that the idea ofgravity came to him as he sat in a contemplative mood and was occasioned by the fall of an apple
1978,The Copernican model got rid of Ptolemys celestial spheres and with them the idea that the universe had anatural boundary
1979,Since fixed stars did not appear to change their positions apart from a rotation across thesky caused by the earth spinning on its axis it became natural to suppose that the fixed stars were objects likeour sun but very much farther away
1980,Newton realized that according to his theory of gravity the stars should attract each other so it seemed theycould not remain essentially motionless
1981,Would they not all fall together at some point In a letter in  toRichard Bentley another leading thinker of his day Newton argued that this would indeed happen if there wereonly a finite number of stars distributed over a finite region of space
1982,But he reasoned that if on the other handthere were an infinite number of stars distributed more or less uniformly over infinite space this would nothappen because there would not be any central point for them to fall to
1983,This argument is an instance of the pitfalls that you can encounter in talking about infinity
1984,In an infiniteuniverse every point can be regarded as the center because every point has an infinite number of stars oneach side of it
1985,According to Newtons law the extra stars would make no difference at all to theoriginal ones on average so the stars would fall in just as fast
1986,We can add as many stars as we like but theywill still always collapse in on themselves
1987,It is an interesting reflection on the general climate of thought before the twentieth century that no one hadsuggested that the universe was expanding or contracting
1988,It was generally accepted that either the universehad existed forever in an unchanging state or that it had been created at a finite time in the past more or lessas we observe it today
1989,In part this may have been due to peoples tendency to believe in eternal truths as wellas the comfort they found in the thought that even though they may grow old and die the universe is eternaland unchanging
1990,Instead they attempted to modify the theory by making theA Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
1991,This did not significantly affect their predictions of themotions of the planets but it allowed an infinite distribution of stars to remain in equilibrium  with the attractiveforces between nearby stars balanced by the repulsive forces from those that were farther away
1992,On the other hand if the stars got a bit farther awayfrom each other the repulsive forces would dominate and drive them farther apart
1993,In fact various contemporaries of Newton had raised the problem and theOlbers article was not even the first to contain plausible arguments against it
1994,The difficulty is that in an infinite static universe nearly every line of sight would end on thesurface of a star
1995,Olbers counterargument was that the light from distant stars would be dimmed by absorption by interveningmatter
1996,In that case the absorbing matter might not have heated up yet or the light from distantstars might not yet have reached us
1997,The beginning of the universe had of course been discussed long before this
1998,According to a number of earlycosmologies and the JewishChristianMuslim tradition the universe started at a finite and not very distanttime in the past
1999,One argument for such a beginning was the feeling that it was necessary to have First Causeto explain the existence of the universe
2000,Within the universe you always explained one event as being causedby some earlier event but the existence of the universe itself could be explained in this way only if it had somebeginning
2001,Thusman and so also perhaps the universe could not have been around all that long
2002,Augustine accepted adate of about  BC for the Creation of the universe according to the book of Genesis
2003,Aristotle and most of the other Greek philosophers on the other hand did not like the idea of a creationbecause it smacked too much of divine intervention
2004,They believed therefore that the human race and theworld around it had existed and would exist forever
2005,The ancients had already considered the argument aboutprogress described above and answered it by saying that there had been periodic floods or other disasters thatrepeatedly set the human race right back to the beginning of civilization
2006,The questions of whether the universe had a beginning in time and whether it is limited in space were laterextensively examined by the philosopher Immanuel Kant in his monumental and very obscure work Critique of Pure Reason published in
2007,He called these questions antinomies that is contradictions of pure reason because he felt that there were equally compelling arguments for believing the thesis that the universe had abeginning and the antithesis that it had existed forever
2008,They are both based on his unspoken assumption that timecontinues back forever whether or not the universe had existed forever
2009,As we shall see the concept of timehas no meaning before the beginning of the universe
2010,Instead he said that time was a property of the universe that God created andthat time did not exist before the beginning of the universe
2011,html  of    AMtime in such a manner as to look as though it had existed forever
2012,This means that at earlier times objects would have been closer together
2013,This discovery finally brought thequestion of the beginning of the universe into the realm of science
2014,Under such conditions all the laws of science and therefore all abilityto predict the future would break down
2015,Their existence can be ignored because it would have no observationalconsequences
2016,One may say that time had a beginning at the big bang in the sense that earlier times simplywould not be defined
2017,It should be emphasized that this beginning in time is very different from those that hadbeen considered previously
2018,In an unchanging universe a beginning in time is something that has to beimposed by some being outside the universe there is no physical necessity for a beginning
2019,One can imaginethat God created the universe at literally any time in the past
2020,One could still imagine that God created theuniverse at the instant of the big bang or even afterwards in just such a way as to make it look as though therehad been a big bang but it would be meaningless to suppose that it was created before the big bang
2021,I shall take the simpleminded view that a theoryis just a model of the universe or a restricted part of it and a set of rules that relate quantities in the model toobservations that we make
2022,A theory is a good theory if it satisfies two requirements
2023,It must accurately describe a large class ofobservations on the basis of a model that contains only a few arbitrary elements and it must make definitepredictions about the results of future observations
2024,For example Aristotle believed Empedocless theory thateverything was made out of four elements earth air fire and water
2025,This was simple enough but did not makeany definite predictions
2026,Yet it predicts the motions of the sun themoon and the planets to a high degree of accuracy
2027,Any physical theory is always provisional in the sense that it is only a hypothesis you can never prove it
2028,On the other hand you can disprove a theory by finding even asingle observation that disagrees with the predictions of the theory
2029,As philosopher of science Karl Popper hasemphasized a good theory is characterized by the fact that it makes a number of predictions that could inprinciple be disproved or falsified by observation
2030,Each time new experiments are observed to agree with thepredictions the theory survives and our confidence in it is increased but if ever a new observation is found todisagree we have to abandon or modify the theory
2031,For example very accurate observations of the planet Mercury revealed a small difference between its motionand the predictions of Newtons theory of gravity
2032,Einsteins general theory of relativity predicted a slightlydifferent motion from Newtons theory
2033,html  of    AMapproach most scientists actually follow is to separate the problem into two parts
2034,Second there is the question of the initial state of the universe
2035,Some people feel that science should be concerned with only the first part they regard the question of theinitial situation as a matter for metaphysics or religion
2036,They would say that God being omnipotent could havestarted the universe off any way he wanted
2037,That may be so but in that case he also could have made itdevelop in a completely arbitrary way
2038,Yet it appears that he chose to make it evolve in a very regular wayaccording to certain laws
2039,It therefore seems equally reasonable to suppose that there are also laws governingthe initial state
2040,It turns out to be very difficult to devise a theory to describe the universe all in one go
2041,Instead we break theproblem up into bits and invent a number of partial theories
2042,Each of these partial theories describes andpredicts a certain limited class of observations neglecting the effects of other quantities or representing themby simple sets of numbers
2043,If everything in the universedepends on everything else in a fundamental way it might be impossible to get close to a full solution byinvestigating parts of the problem in isolation
2044,Nevertheless it is certainly the way that we have made progressin the past
2045,Thus one does not need to have a theory of the structure andconstitution of the sun and the planets in order to calculate their orbits
2046,Today scientists describe the universe in terms of two basic partial theories  the general theory of relativityand quantum mechanics
2047,They are the great intellectual achievements of the first half of this century
2048,Thegeneral theory of relativity describes the force of gravity and the largescale structure of the universe that isthe structure on scales from only a few miles to as large as a million million million million  with twentyfourzeros after it miles the size of the observable universe
2049,Quantum mechanics on the other hand deals withphenomena on extremely small scales such as a millionth of a millionth of an inch
2050,One of themajor endeavors in physics today and the major theme of this book is the search for a new theory that willincorporate them both  a quantum theory of gravity
2051,We do not yet have such a theory and we may still be along way from having one but we do already know many of the properties that it must have
2052,And we shall seein later chapters that we already know a fair amount about the predications a quantum theory of gravity mustmake
2053,Now if you believe that the universe is not arbitrary but is governed by definite laws you ultimately have tocombine the partial theories into a complete unified theory that will describe everything in the universe
2054,Butthere is a fundamental paradox in the search for such a complete unified theory
2055,In such a scheme it is reasonable to suppose that we might progress ever closer toward the laws that governour universe
2056,Yet if there really is a complete unified theory it would also presumably determine our actions
2057,Or no conclusion at allThe only answer that I can give to this problem is based on Darwins principle of natural selection
2058,The idea isthat in any population of selfreproducing organisms there will be variations in the genetic material andupbringing that different individuals have
2059,These differences will mean that some individuals are better ablethan others to draw the right conclusions about the world around them and to act accordingly
2060,These individualswill be more likely to survive and reproduce and so their pattern of behavior and thought will come to dominate
2061,It is not so clear that this is still the case our scientific discoveries may well destroy us alland even if they dont a complete unified theory may not make much difference to our chances of survival
2062,html  of    AMBecause the partial theories that we already have are sufficient to make accurate predictions in all but the mostextreme situations the search for the ultimate theory of the universe seems difficult to justify on practicalgrounds
2063,It is worth noting though that similar arguments could have been used against both relativity andquantum mechanics and these theories have given us both nuclear energy and the microelectronicsrevolution The discovery of a complete unified theory therefore may not aid the survival of our species
2064,But ever since the dawn of civilization people have not been content to seeevents as unconnected and inexplicable
2065,They have craved an understanding of the underlying order in theworld
2066,Humanitys deepest desire forknowledge is justification enough for our continuing quest
2067,And our goal is nothing less than a completedescription of the universe we live in
2068,html  of    AMCHAPTER  SPACE AND TIME   Our present ideas about the motion of bodies date back to Galileo and Newton
2069,It followed that a heavy body should fall faster than a light one because it would have a greater pulltoward the earth
2070,The Aristotelian tradition also held that one could work out all the laws that govern the universe by purethought it was not necessary to check by observation
2071,So no one until Galileo bothered to see whether bodiesof different weight did in fact fall at different speeds
2072,It is said that Galileo demonstrated that Aristotles beliefwas false by dropping weights from the leaning tower of Pisa
2073,The story is almost certainly untrue but Galileodid do something equivalent he rolled balls of different weights down a smooth slope
2074,The situation is similar tothat of heavy bodies falling vertically but it is easier to observe because the Speeds are smaller
2075,Of course a lead weight would fall faster than afeather but that is only because a feather is slowed down by air resistance
2076,If one drops two bodies that donthave much air resistance such as two different lead weights they fall at the same rate
2077,Scott performed the feather and lead weightexperiment and found that indeed they did hit the ground at the same time
2078,Galileos measurements were used by Newton as the basis of his laws of motion
2079,In Galileos experiments as abody rolled down the slope it was always acted on by the same force its weight and the effect was to make itconstantly speed up
2080,This idea was first stated explicitly in NewtonsPrincipia Mathematica published in  and is known as Newtons first law
2081,This states that the body will accelerate or change itsspeed at a rate that is proportional to the force
2082,For example the acceleration is twice as great if the force istwice as great
2083,The acceleration is also smaller the greater the mass or quantity of matter of the body
2084,Thesame force acting on a body of twice the mass will produce half the acceleration
2085,A familiar example isprovided by a car the more powerful the engine the greater the acceleration but the heavier the car thesmaller the acceleration for the same engine
2086,Thus the force between two bodies would be twice as strong if one ofthe bodies say body A had its mass doubled
2087,Thus the total force between A and B would be twice the original force
2088,And if say one of the bodies had twice the mass and the other had three times the mass then the force would be six times as strong
2089,According to Newtons second law these two effects willexactly cancel each other so the acceleration will be the same in all cases
2090,Newtons law of gravity also tells us that the farther apart the bodies the smaller the force
2091,Newtons law ofgravity says that the gravitational attraction of a star is exactly one quarter that of a similar star at half thedistance
2092,This law predicts the orbits of the earth the moon and the planets with great accuracy
2093,If the lawwere that the gravitational attraction of a star went down faster or increased more rapidly with distance theorbits of the planets would not be elliptical they would either spiral in to the sun or escape from the sun
2094,But it follows from Newtons laws that there is no uniqueA Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
2095,One could equally well say that body A was at rest and body B was moving at constant speed with respect to body A or that body B was at rest and body A was moving
2096,For example if one sets aside for a moment the rotation of the earth and its orbit round the sun one could say that the earth was at rest and that atrain on it was traveling north at ninety miles per hour or that the train was at rest and the earth was movingsouth at ninety miles per hour
2097,If one carried out experiments with moving bodies on the train all Newtons lawswould still hold
2098,For instance playing PingPong on the train one would find that the ball obeyed Newtons lawsjust like a ball on a table by the track
2099,So there is no way to tell whether it is the train or the earth that is moving
2100,The lack of an absolute standard of rest meant that one could not determine whether two events that took placeat different times occurred in the same position in space
2101,For example suppose our PingPong ball on the trainbounces straight up and down hitting the table twice on the same spot one second apart
2102,To someone on thetrack the two bounces would seem to take place about forty meters apart because the train would havetraveled that far down the track between the bounces
2103,The nonexistence of absolute rest therefore meant thatone could not give an event an absolute position in space as Aristotle had believed
2104,The positions of eventsand the distances between them would be different for a person on the train and one on the track and therewould be no reason to prefer one persons position to the others
2105,Newton was very worried by this lack of absolute position or absolute space as it was called because it didnot accord with his idea of an absolute God
2106,In fact he refused to accept lack of absolute space even though itwas implied by his laws
2107,Johnson was told of Berkeleys opinion he cried I refute it thus and stubbed his toe on alarge stone
2108,The fact that light travels at a finite but very high speed was first discovered in  by the Danish astronomerOle Christensen Roemer
2109,As theearth and Jupiter orbit around the sun the distance between them varies
2110,Roemer noticed that eclipses ofJupiters moons appeared later the farther we were from Jupiter
2111,NeverthelessRoemers achievement in not only proving that light travels at a finite speed but also in measuring that speedwas remarkable  coming as it did eleven years before Newtons publication of Principia Mathematica
2112,Maxwells equations predicted that there could be wavelike disturbances in the combinedelectromagnetic field and that these would travel at a fixed speed like ripples on a pond
2113,Shorter wavelengths are known as microwaves a few centimeters or infrared more than atenthousandth of a centimeter
2114,Visible light has a wavelength of between only forty and eighty millionths of acentimeter
2115,Even shorter wavelengths are known as ultraviolet X rays and gamma rays
2116,Maxwells theory predicted that radio or light waves should travel at a certain fixed speed
2117,Light waves should travel through the ether as sound waves travel through air and their speedshould therefore be relative to the ether
2118,Different observers moving relative to the ether would see lightA Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
2119,html  of    AMcoming toward them at different speeds but lights speed relative to the ether would remain fixed
2120,Theycompared the speed of light in the direction of the earths motion with that at right angles to the earths motion
2121,A similar point was made a few weeks later by a leadingFrench mathematician Henri Poincare
2122,Einstein is usually given the credit for the new theory butPoincare is remembered by having his name attached to an important part of it
2123,In other words it will make it harder to increase its speed
2124,Thiseffect is only really significant for objects moving at speeds close to the speed of light
2125,For example at percent of the speed of light an objects mass is only
2126,percent more than normal while at  percent of thespeed of light it would be more than twice its normal mass
2127,As an object approaches the speed of light its massrises ever more quickly so it takes more and more energy to speed it up further
2128,It can in fact never reach thespeed of light because by then its mass would have become infinite and by the equivalence of mass andenergy it would have taken an infinite amount of energy to get it there
2129,For this reason any normal object isforever confined by relativity to move at speeds slower than the speed of light
2130,Only light or other waves thathave no intrinsic mass can move at the speed of light
2131,An equally remarkable consequence of relativity is the way it has revolutionized our ideas of space and time
2132,Since the speed of the light is just the distance it has traveled divided by the time it hastaken different observers would measure different speeds for the light
2133,In other words the theory of relativity put an end to the idea of absolute time It appeared that eachobserver must have his own measure of time as recorded by a clock carried with him and that identical clockscarried by different observers would not necessarily agree
2134,An event in this sense is something that takes place at a singlepoint in space at a specified point in time
2135,No particular observers measurements are any more correct than any other observers butall the measurements are related
2136,Nowadays we use just this method to measure distances precisely because we can measure time moreaccurately than length
2137,In effect the meter is defined to be the distance traveled by light in
2138,The reason for that particular number is thatit corresponds to the historical definition of the meter  in terms of two marks on a particular platinum bar keptin Paris
2139,Equally we can use a more convenient new unit of length called a lightsecond
2140,This is simplydefined as the distance that light travels in one second
2141,In the theory of relativity we now define distance inA Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
2142,html  of    AMterms of time and the speed of light so it follows automatically that every observer will measure light to havethe same speed by definition  meter per
2143,We mustaccept that time is not completely separate from and independent of space but is combined with it to form anobject called spacetime
2144,It is a matter of common experience that one can describe the position of a point in space by three numbers orcoordinates
2145,For instance one can say that a point in a room is seven feet from one wall three feet fromanother and five feet above the floor
2146,Or one could specify that a point was at a certain latitude and longitudeand a certain height above sea level
2147,One is free to use any three suitable coordinates although they have onlya limited range of validity
2148,One would not specify the position of the moon in terms of miles north and mileswest of Piccadilly Circus and feet above sea level
2149,Instead one might describe it in terms of distance from thesun distance from the plane of the orbits of the planets and the angle between the line joining the moon to thesun and the line joining the sun to a nearby star such as Alpha Centauri
2150,Even these coordinates would not beof much use in describing the position of the sun in our galaxy or the position of our galaxy in the local group ofgalaxies
2151,In eachpatch one can use a different set of three coordinates to specify the position of a point
2152,An event is something that happens at a particular point in space and at a particular time
2153,Again the choice of coordinates is arbitrary one can use any threewelldefined spatial coordinates and any measure of time
2154,In relativity there is no real distinction between thespace and time coordinates just as there is no real difference between any two space coordinates
2155,For instance instead of measuring the position of a point on the earth in miles northof Piccadilly and miles west of Piccadilly one could use miles northeast of Piccadilly and miles northwest ofPiccadilly
2156,Similarly in relativity one could use a new time coordinate that was the old time in seconds plusthe distance in lightseconds north of Piccadilly
2157,It is often helpful to think of the four coordinates of an event as specifying its position in a fourdimensionalspace called spacetime
2158,The surface of the earth is twodimensional because the position of a point can bespecified by two coordinates latitude and longitude
2159,The other two spatial dimensions are ignoredor sometimes one of them is indicated by perspective
2160,html  of    AMFigure  For example in Figure   time is measured upward in years and the distance along the line from the sun to Alpha Centauri is measured horizontally in miles
2161,A ray of light from the sunfollows the diagonal line and takes four years to get from the sun to Alpha Centauri
2162,After one millionth of asecond the light will have spread out to form a sphere with a radius of  meters after two millionths of asecond the radius will be  meters and so on
2163,The ripples spread out as a circle that gets bigger as time goes on
2164,html  of    AMFigure  Similarly the light spreading out from an event forms a threedimensional cone in the fourdimensionalspacetime
2165,This cone is called the future light cone of the event
2166,html  of    AMFigure  Given an event P one can divide the other events in the universe into three classes
2167,Those events that can bereached from the event P by a particle or wave traveling at or below the speed of light are said to be in thefuture of P
2168,They will lie within or on the expanding sphere of light emitted from the event P
2169,Thus they will liewithin or on the future light cone of P in the spacetime diagram
2170,html  of    AMFigure  We would know about it only after eight minutes the time it takes light to reach us from the sun
2171,For every event in spacetime we may construct a light cone the set of all possible paths oflight in spacetime emitted at that event and since the speed of light is the same at every event and in everydirection all the light cones will be identical and will all point in the same direction
2172,The theory also tells us thatnothing can travel faster than light
2173,This means that the path of any object through space and time must berepresented by a line that lies within the light cone at each event on it Fig
2174,This meant that if one moved one of theobjects the force on the other one would change instantaneously
2175,Or in other gravitational effects should travelwith infinite velocity instead of at or below the speed of light as the special theory of relativity required
2176,Einstein made a number of unsuccessful attempts between  and  to find a theory of gravity that wasconsistent with special relativity
2177,Einstein made the revolutionary suggestion that gravity is not a force like other forces but is a consequence ofthe fact that spacetime is not flat as had been previously assumed it is curved or warped by the distributionA Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
2178,Ageodesic is the shortest or longest path between two nearby points
2179,For example the surface of the earth is atwodimensional curved space
2180,A geodesic on the earth is called a great circle and is the shortest routebetween two points Fig
2181,As the geodesic is the shortest path between any two airports this is the routean airline navigator will tell the pilot to fly along
2182,In general relativity bodies always follow straight lines infourdimensional spacetime but they nevertheless appear to us to move along curved paths in ourthreedimensional space
2183,This is rather like watching an airplane flying over hilly ground
2184,Although it follows astraight line in threedimensional space its shadow follows a curved path on the twodimensional ground
2185,The mass of the sun curves spacetime in such a way that although the earth follows a straight path infourdimensional spacetime it appears to us to move along a circular orbit in threedimensional space
2186,Fact the orbits of the planets predicted by general relativity are almost exactly the same as those predicted bythe Newtonian theory of gravity
2187,Smallthough this effect is it had been noticed before  and served as one of the first confirmations of Einsteinstheory
2188,In recent years the even smaller deviations of the orbits of the other planets from the Newtonianpredictions have been measured by radar and found to agree with the predictions of general relativity
2189,Again the fact that space is curved means that light nolonger appears to travel in straight lines in space
2190,So general relativity predicts that light should be bent bygravitational fields
2191,For example the theory predicts that the light cones of points near the sun would be slightlybent inward on account of the mass of the sun
2192,This means that light from a distant star that happened to passnear the sun would be deflected through a small angle causing the star to appear in a different position to anobserver on the earth Fig
2193,They therefore change their apparent position relative to other stars
2194,It is normally very difficult to seethis effect because the light from the sun makes it impossible to observe stars that appear near to the sun thesky
2195,This proof of a Germantheory by British scientists was hailed as a great act of reconciliation between the two countries after the war
2196,Their measurement had been sheer luck or a case of knowingthe result they wanted to get not an uncommon occurrence in science
2197,Another prediction of general relativity is that time should appear to slower near a massive body like the earth
2198,This is because there is a relation between the energy of light and its frequency that is the number of waves oflight per second the greater the energy the higher frequency
2199,As light travels upward in the earthsgravitational field it loses energy and so its frequency goes down
2200,This means that the length of time betweenone wave crest and the next goes up
2201,To someone high up it would appear that everything down below wasmaking longer to happen
2202,This prediction was tested in  using a pair of very accurate clocks mounted atthe top and bottom of a water tower
2203,The difference in the speed of clocks at different heightsabove the earth is now of considerable practical importance with the advent of very accurate navigationsystems based on signals from satellites
2204,If one ignored the predictions of general relativity the position thatone calculated would be wrong by several milesNewtons laws of motion put an end to the idea of absolute position in space
2205,Suppose that one twin goes to live on the top of a mountain while theother stays at sea level
2206,Thus if they met again one would beolder than the other
2207,In this case the difference in ages would be very small but it would be much larger if oneA Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
2208,html  of    AMof the twins went for a long trip in a spaceship at nearly the speed of light
2209,This is known as the twins paradox but it is a paradox only ifone has the idea of absolute time at the back of ones mind
2210,This was true even of the special theory of relativity
2211,Bodies moved forcesattracted and repelled but time and space simply continued unaffected
2212,It was natural to think that space andtime went on forever
2213,Space and time not only affect butalso are affected by everything that happens in the universe
2214,Just as one cannot talk about events in theuniverse without the notions of space and time so in general relativity it became meaningless to talk aboutspace and time outside the limits of the universe
2215,In the following decades this new understanding of space and time was to revolutionize our view of theuniverse
2216,The old idea of an essentially unchanging universe that could have existed and could continue toexist forever was replaced by the notion of a dynamic expanding universe that seemed to have begun a finitetime ago and that might end at a finite time in the future
2217,And years later it was also to be the starting point for my work in theoretical physics
2218,html  of    AMCHAPTER  THE EXPANDING UNIVERSE   If one looks at the sky on a clear moonless night the brightest objects one sees are likely to be the planetsVenus Mars Jupiter and Saturn
2219,Some of these fixed stars do in fact appear to change very slightly theirpositions relative to each other as earth orbits around the sun they are not really fixed at all This is becausethey are comparatively near to us
2220,As the earth goes round the sun we see them from different positionsagainst the background of more distant stars
2221,This is fortunate because it enables us to measure directly thedistance of these stars from us the nearer they are the more they appear to move
2222,The nearest star calledProxima Centauri is found to be about four lightyears away the light from it takes about four years to reachearth or about twentythree million million miles
2223,Most of the other stars that are visible to the naked eye liewithin a few hundred lightyears of us
2224,Only a few decades later the astronomer Sir William Herschel confirmed this idea bypainstakingly cataloging the positions and distances of vast numbers of stars
2225,Even so the idea gainedcomplete acceptance only early this century
2226,There were in fact many others with vast tracts of emptyspace between them
2227,Hubble was forced therefore touse indirect methods to measure the distances
2228,For nearby stars we can measure theirapparent brightness and their distance and so we can work out their luminosity
2229,Conversely if we knew theluminosity of stars in other galaxies we could work out their distance by measuring their apparent brightness
2230,If we could do this for a number of stars in thesame galaxy and our calculations always gave the same distance we could be fairly confident of our estimate
2231,In this way Edwin Hubble worked out the distances to nine different galaxies
2232,We now know that our galaxy isonly one of some hundred thousand million that can be seen using modern telescopes each galaxy itselfcontaining some hundred thousand million stars
2233,html  of    AMFigure  We live in a galaxy that is about one hundred thousand lightyears across and is slowly rotating the stars in itsspiral arms orbit around its center about once every several hundred million years
2234,Our sun is just an ordinaryaveragesized yellow star near the inner edge of one of the spiral arms
2235,Newton discovered that if light from the sun passesthrough a triangularshaped piece of glass called a prism it breaks up into its component colors its spectrumas in a rainbow
2236,By focusing a telescope on an individual star or galaxy one can similarly observe the spectrumof the light from that star or galaxy
2237,In fact the light emitted by any opaque object that is glowing red hot has a characteristic spectrumthat depends only on its temperature  a thermal spectrum
2238,This means that we can tell a stars temperaturefrom the spectrum of its light
2239,Moreover we find that certain very specific colors are missing from starsspectra and these missing colors may vary from star to star
2240,To understand theimplications of this we must first understand the Doppler effect
2241,As we have seen visible light consists offluctuations or waves in the electromagnetic field
2242,The wavelength or distance from one wave crest to thenext of light is extremely small ranging from four to seven tenmillionths of a meter
2243,Now imagine a source of light at a constantdistance from us such as a star emitting waves of light at a constant wavelength
2244,Obviously the wavelength ofA Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
2245,Correspondingly if the source is moving away from us thewavelength of the waves we receive will be longer
2246,In the case of light therefore means that stars movingaway from us will have their spectra shifted toward the red end of the spectrum redshifted and those movingtoward us will have their spectra blueshifted
2247,Indeed the police make use of the Doppler effect to measure the speed of cars by measuring the wavelengthof pulses of radio waves reflected off them
2248,ln the years following his proof of the existence of other galaxies Rubble spent his time cataloging theirdistances and observing their spectra
2249,At that time most people expected the galaxies to be moving aroundquite randomly and so expected to find as many blueshifted spectra as redshifted ones
2250,It was quite asurprise therefore to find that most galaxies appeared redshifted nearly all were moving away from us Moresurprising still was the finding that Hubble published in   even the size of a galaxys red shift is not random but is directly proportional to the galaxys distance from us
2251,Or in other words the farther a galaxy is the fasterit is moving away And that meant that the universe could not be static as everyone previously had thought isin fact expanding the distance between the different galaxies is changing all the time
2252,The discovery that the universe is expanding was one of the great intellectual revolutions of the twentiethcentury
2253,Newton and others should haverealized that a static universe would soon start to contract under the influence of gravity
2254,If it was expanding fairly slowly the force of gravity would cause it eventually tostop expanding and then to start contracting
2255,If it has a fairly low speedgravity will eventually stop the rocket and it will start falling back
2256,On the other hand if the rocket has more thana certain critical speed about seven miles per second gravity will not be strong enough to pull it back so it willkeep going away from the earth forever
2257,This behavior of the universe could have been predicted fromNewtons theory of gravity at any time in the nineteenth the eighteenth or even the late seventeenth century
2258,Yet so strong was the belief in a static universe that it persisted into the early twentieth century
2259,He claimed that spacetime had an inbuilt tendency toexpand and this could be made to balance exactly the attraction of all the matter in the universe so that astatic universe would result
2260,Only one man it seems was willing to take general relativity at face value andwhile Einstein and other physicists were looking for ways of avoiding general relativitys prediction of anonstatic universe the Russian physicist and mathematician Alexander Friedmann instead set about explainingit
2261,For example aswe have seen the other stars in our galaxy form a distinct band of light across the night sky called the MilkyWay
2262,But if we look at distant galaxies there seems to be more or less the same number of them
2263,So theuniverse does seem to be roughly the same in every direction provided one views it on a large scale comparedto the distance between galaxies and ignores the differences on small scales
2264,For a long time this wassufficient justification for Friedmanns assumption  as a rough approximation to the real universe
2265,But morerecently a lucky accident uncovered the fact that Friedmanns assumption is in fact a remarkably accurateA Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
2266,In  two American physicists at the Bell Telephone Laboratories in New Jersey Arno Penzias and RobertWilson were testing a very sensitive microwave detector
2267,Microwaves are just like light waves but with awavelength of around a centimeter
2268,The noise did not appear to be coming from any particular direction
2269,First they discovered bird droppings in their detector and checked for other possible malfunctions but soonruled these out
2270,It was also the same day and night and throughout the year even though the earth was rotating on its axis and orbiting aroundthe sun
2271,In fact we know that the radiation must have traveled to us across most of the observable universe and sinceit appears to be the same in different directions the universe must also be the same in every direction if onlyon a large scale
2272,These were first detected in  by the CosmicBackground Explorer satellite or COBE at a level of about one part in a hundred thousand
2273,Small though thesevariations are they are very important as will be explained in Chapter
2274,At roughly the same time as Penzias and Wilson were investigating noise in their detector two Americanphysicists at nearby Princeton University Bob Dicke and Jim Peebles were also taking an interest inmicrowaves
2275,They were working on a suggestion made by George Gamow once a student of AlexanderFriedmann that the early universe should have been very hot and dense glowing white hot
2276,Dicke andPeebles argued that we should still be able to see the glow of the early universe because light from verydistant parts of it would only just be reaching us now
2277,In particular it might seem that if weobserve all other galaxies to be moving away from us then we must be at the center of the universe
2278,We believe it only on grounds of modesty it would be most remarkable if the universelooked the same in every direction around us but not around other points in the universe In Friedmannsmodel all the galaxies are moving directly away from each other
2279,The situation is rather like a balloon with anumber of spots painted on it being steadily blown up
2280,As the balloon expands the distance between any twospots increases but there is no spot that can be said to be the center of the expansion
2281,Moreover the fartherapart the spots are the faster they will be moving apart
2282,So it predicted that the red shift ofa galaxy should be directly proportional to its distance from us exactly as Hubble found
2283,Although Friedmann found only one there are in fact three different kinds of models that obey Friedmanns twofundamental assumptions
2284,The galaxies then start to move toward each other and the universe contracts
2285,It starts at zero increases to a maximum and then decreases to zero again
2286,In the second kind of solution the universe isexpanding so rapidly that the gravitational attraction can never stop it though it does slow it down a bit
2287,It starts at zero and eventually the galaxies are moving apart at a steady speed
2288,A remarkable feature of the first kind of Friedmann model is that in it the universe is not infinite in space butneither does space have any boundary
2289,Gravity is so strong that space is bent round onto itself making it ratherlike the surface of the earth
2290,In the first kind of Friedmann model space is just like this but with three dimensions instead of two for theearths surface
2291,The fourth dimension time is also finite in extent but it is like a line with two ends orboundaries a beginning and an end
2292,Finally in the third kind ofFriedmann model with just the critical rate of expansion space is flat and therefore is also infinite
2293,If the density is less than a certain critical value determined bythe rate of expansion the gravitational attraction will be too weak to halt the expansion
2294,If the density is greaterthan the critical value gravity will stop the expansion at some time in the future and cause the universe torecollapse
2295,So all we know is that theuniverse is expanding by between  percent and  percent every thousand million years
2296,If we add up the masses of allA Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
2297,html  of    AMthe stars that we can see in our galaxy and other galaxies the total is less than one hundredth of the amountrequired to halt the expansion of the universe even for the lowest estimate of the rate of expansion
2298,Moreover most galaxies are found in clusters and we can similarly infer the presence of yet moredark matter in between the galaxies in these clusters by its effect on the motion of the galaxies
2299,The present evidence therefore suggests that theuniverse will probably expand forever but all we can really be sure of is that even if the universe is going torecollapse it wont do so for at least another ten thousand million years since it has already been expandingfor at least that long
2300,This should not unduly worry us by that time unless we have colonized beyond the SolarSystem mankind will long since have died out extinguished along with our sunAll of the Friedmann solutions have the feature that at some time in the past between ten and twenty thousandmillion years ago the distance between neighboring galaxies must have been zero
2301,As far as we are concerned events before the big bang can have noconsequences so they should not form part of a scientific model of the universe
2302,We should therefore cut themout of the model and say that time had a beginning at the big bang
2303,Many people do not like the idea that time has a beginning probably because it smacks of divine intervention
2304,The Catholic Church on the other hand seized on the big bang model and in officially pronounced it tobe in accordance with the Bible
2305,There were therefore a number of attempts to avoid the conclusion that therehad been a big bang
2306,The proposal that gained widest support was called the steady state theory
2307,The idea wasthat as the galaxies moved away from each other new galaxies were continually forming in the gaps inbetween from new matter that was being continually created
2308,The universe would therefore look roughly thesame at all times as well as at all points of space
2309,The steady state theory required a modification of generalrelativity to allow for the continual creation of matter but the rate that was involved was so low about oneparticle per cubic kilometer per year that it was not in conflict with experiment
2310,The theory was a good scientifictheory in the sense described in Chapter  it was simple and it made definite predictions that could be testedby observation
2311,They interpreted the weak sources as being the more distant ones and the stronger ones as beingnearer
2312,Then there appeared to be less common sources per unit volume of space for the nearby sources thanfor the distant ones
2313,Alternatively it could mean that the sources were more numerous in thepast at the time that the radio waves left on their journey to us than they are now
2314,Moreover the discovery of the microwave radiation byPenzias and Wilson in  also indicated that the universe must have been much denser in the past
2315,html  of    AMAnother attempt to avoid the conclusion that there must have been a big bang and therefore a beginning oftime was made by two Russian scientists Evgenii Lifshitz and Isaac Khalatnikov in
2316,Perhaps of all the models that were roughly like the real universe only Friedmanns wouldcontain a big bang singularity
2317,In Friedmanns models the galaxies are all moving directly away from eachother  so it is not surprising that at some time in the past they were all at the same  place
2318,So in reality they need never have been all at exactly the same place only very close together
2319,Perhaps then the current expanding universe resulted not from a big bang singularity but from an earliercontracting phase as the universe had collapsed the particles in it might not have all collided but had flownpast and then away from each other producing the present expansion of the the universe that were roughly likeFriedmanns models but took account of the irregularities and random velocities of galaxies in the real universe
2320,They argued that since there seemed to beinfinitely more Friedmannlike models without a big bang singularity than there were with one we shouldconclude that there had not in reality been a big bang
2321,And since the surface of the region shrinks to zero so too mustits volume
2322,All the matter in the star will be compressed into a region of zero volume so the density of matterand the curvature of spacetime become infinite
2323,In other words one has a singularity contained within a regionof spacetime known as a black hole
2324,At first sight Penroses result applied only to stars it didnt have anything to say about the question of whetherthe entire universe had a big bang singularity in its past
2325,Two years before I had been diagnosed as suffering from ALS commonly known as Lou Gehrigs disease ormotor neuron disease and given to understand that I had only one or two more years to live
2326,In thesecircumstances there had not seemed much point in working on my Ph
2327,Yet two years had gone by and I was not that much worse
2328,In fact things were going rather well for me and Ihad gotten engaged to a very nice girl Jane Wilde
2329,But in order to get married I needed a job and in order toget a job I needed a Ph
2330,In  I read about Penroses theorem that any body undergoing gravitational collapse must eventually form asingularity
2331,I soon realized that if one reversed the direction of time in Penroses theorem so that the collapsebecame an expansion the conditions of his theorem would still hold provided the universe were roughly like aFriedmann model on large scales at the present time
2332,For technical reasons Penroses theorem required that the universe be infinite in space
2333,So I could in fact use it to prove that there should be a singularity only if the universe wasexpanding fast enough to avoid collapsing again since only those Friedmann models were infinite in space
2334,During the next few years I developed new mathematical techniques to remove this and other technicalconditions from the theorems that proved that singularities must occur
2335,So in the end our workA Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
2336,html  of    AMbecame generally accepted and nowadays nearly everyone assumes that the universe started with a big bangsingularity
2337,It is perhaps ironic that having changed my mind I am now trying to convince other physicists thatthere was in fact no singularity at the beginning of the universe  as we shall see later it can disappear oncequantum effects are taken into account
2338,Hubbles discovery that the universe was expanding and the realization of theinsignificance of our own planet in the vastness of the universe were just the starting point
2339,As experimentaland theoretical evidence mounted it became more and more clear that the universe must have had abeginning in time until in  this was finally proved by Penrose and myself on the basis of Einsteins generaltheory of relativity
2340,At the start of the s then we were forced to turn our search for anunderstanding of the universe from our theory of the extraordinarily vast to our theory of the extraordinarily tiny
2341,That theory quantum mechanics will be described next before we turn to the efforts to combine the two partialtheories into a single quantum theory of gravity
2342,html  of    AMCHAPTER  THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE   The success of scientific theories particularly Newtons theory of gravity led the French scientist the Marquis de Laplaceat the beginning of the nineteenth century to argue that the universe was completely deterministic
2343,Laplace suggestedthat there should be a set of scientific laws that would allow us to predict everything that would happen in the universe ifonly we knew the complete state of the universe at one time
2344,For example if we knew the positions and speeds of thesun and the planets at one time then we could use Newtons laws to calculate the state of the Solar System at any othertime
2345,Determinism seems fairly obvious in this case but Laplace went further to assume that there were similar lawsgoverning everything else including human behavior
2346,According to the laws we believed at the time a hot body ought to give off electromagnetic waves such as radiowaves visible light or X rays equally at all frequencies
2347,For example a hot body should radiate the same amount ofenergy in waves with frequencies between one and two million million waves a second as in waves with frequenciesbetween two and three million million waves a second
2348,Now since the number of waves a second is unlimited this wouldmean that the total energy radiated would be infinite
2349,In order to avoid this obviously ridiculous result the German scientist Max Planck suggested in  that light X raysand other waves could not be emitted at an arbitrary rate but only in certain packets that he called quanta
2350,Moreovereach quantum had a certain amount of energy that was greater the higher the frequency of the waves so at a highenough frequency the emission of a single quantum would require more energy than was available
2351,In order to predict the future position and velocity of a particle one has to beable to measure its present position and velocity accurately
2352,The obvious way to do this is to shine light on the particle
2353,Some of the waves of light will be scattered by the particle and this will indicate its position
2354,Now by Plancks quantumhypothesis one cannot use an arbitrarily small amount of light one has to use at least one quantum
2355,This quantum willdisturb the particle and change its velocity in a way that cannot be predicted
2356,moreover the more accurately onemeasures the position the shorter the wavelength of the light that one needs and hence the higher the energy of a singlequantum
2357,So the velocity of the particle will be disturbed by a larger amount
2358,In other words the more accurately you tryto measure the position of the particle the less accurately you can measure its speed and vice versa
2359,Even after more than seventyyears they have not been fully appreciated by many philosophers and are still the subject of much controversy
2360,It seems better to employ the principle of economy known asOccams razor and cut out all the features of the theory that cannot be observed
2361,This approach led Heisenberg ErwinSchrodinger and Paul Dirac in the s to reformulate mechanics into a new theory called quantum mechanics basedon the uncertainty principle
2362,In general quantum mechanics does not predict a single definite result for an observation
2363,html  of    AMmeasurement would be A in a certain number of cases B in a different number and so on
2364,One could predict theapproximate number of times that the result would be A or B but one could not predict the specific result of an individualmeasurement
2365,Quantum mechanics therefore introduces an unavoidable element of unpredictability or randomness intoscience
2366,Einstein objected to this very strongly despite the important role he had played in the development of theseideas
2367,Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize for his contribution to quantum theory
2368,Nevertheless Einstein neveraccepted that the universe was governed by chance his feelings were summed up in his famous statement God doesnot play dice
2369,Indeed it has been an outstandingly successful theory and underlies nearly all of modern science andtechnology
2370,Although light is made up of waves Plancks quantum hypothesis tells us that in some ways it behaves as if it werecomposed of particles it can be emitted or absorbed only in packets or quanta
2371,Equally Heisenbergs uncertaintyprinciple implies that particles behave in some respects like waves they do not have a definite position but are smearedout with a certain probability distribution
2372,The theory of quantum mechanics is based on an entirely new type ofmathematics that no longer describes the real world in terms of particles and waves it is only the observations of theworld that may be described in those terms
2373,There is thus a duality between waves and particles in quantum mechanicsfor some purposes it is helpful to think of particles as waves and for other purposes it is better to think of waves asparticles
2374,That is to say the crests of one set of waves may coincide with the troughs of the other set
2375,The twosets of waves then cancel each other out rather than adding up to a stronger wave as one might expect Figure
2376,Figure  A familiar example of interference in the case of light is the colors that are often seen in soap bubbles
2377,These are causedby reflection of light from the two sides of the thin film of water forming the bubble
2378,White light consists of light waves ofall different wavelengths or colors For certain wavelengths the crests of the waves reflected from one side of the soapfilm coincide with the troughs reflected from the other side
2379,Interference can also occur for particles because of theduality introduced by quantum mechanics
2380,html  of    AMFigure  Consider a partition with two narrow parallel slits in it
2381,On one side of the partition one places a source of fight of aparticular color that is of a particular wavelength
2382,Most of the light will hit the partition but a small amount will gothrough the slits
2383,Now suppose one places a screen on the far side of the partition from the light
2384,Any point on the screenwill receive waves from the two slits
2385,The result is a characteristic pattern of light and dark fringes
2386,The remarkable thing is that one gets exactly the same kind of fringes if one replaces the source of light by a source ofparticles such as electrons with a definite speed this means that the corresponding waves have a definite length
2387,Itseems the more peculiar because if one only has one slit one does not get any fringes just a uniform distribution ofelectrons across the screen
2388,One might therefore think that opening another slit would just increase the number ofelectrons hitting each point of the screen but because of interference it actually decreases it in some places
2389,Ifelectrons are sent through the slits one at a time one would expect each to pass through one slit or the other and sobehave just as if the slit it passed through were the only one there  giving a uniform distribution on the screen
2390,Each electron therefore must beA Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
2391,The attraction between thepositive and negative electricity was supposed to keep the electrons in their orbits in the same way that the gravitationalattraction between the sun and the planets keeps the planets in their orbits
2392,The trouble with this was that the laws ofmechanics and electricity before quantum mechanics predicted that the electrons would lose energy and so spiralinward until they collided with the nucleus
2393,This would mean that the atom and indeed all matter should rapidly collapseto a state of very high density
2394,A partial solution to this problem was found by the Danish scientist Niels Bohr in
2395,Hesuggested that maybe the electrons were not able to orbit at just any distance from the central nucleus but only at certainspecified distances
2396,If one also supposed that only one or two electrons could orbit at any one of these distances thiswould solve the problem of the collapse of the atom because the electrons could not spiral in any farther than to fill upthe orbits with e least distances and energies
2397,Moreover the idea of a limitedset of allowed orbits seemed very arbitrary
2398,It revealed thatan electron orbiting around the nucleus could be thought of as a wave with a wavelength that depended on its velocity
2399,For these orbits the wave crest would be in the same position each time round so thewaves would add up these orbits would correspond to Bohrs allowed orbits
2400,A nice way of visualizing the waveparticle duality is the socalled sum over histories introduced by the American scientistRichard Feynman
2401,In this approach the particle is not supposed to have a single history or path in spacetime as it wouldin a classical nonquantum theory
2402,Instead it is supposed to go from A to B by every possible path
2403,With each path thereare associated a couple of numbers one represents the size of a wave and the other represents the position in the cyclei
2404,The probability of going from A to B is found by adding up the waves for all thepaths
2405,In general if one compares a set of neighboring paths the phases or positions in the cycle will differ greatly
2406,Thismeans that the waves associated with these paths will almost exactly cancel each other out
2407,The waves for these paths will not cancel out Such pathscorrespond to Bohrs allowed orbits
2408,Since the structure of molecules and their reactions with each other underlie all ofchemistry and biology quantum mechanics allows us in principle to predict nearly everything we see around us withinthe limits set by the uncertainty principle
2409,Einsteins general theory of relativity seems to govern the largescale structure of the universe
2410,The reason that this does not lead to any discrepancy with observation is that all thegravitational fields that we normally experience are very weak
2411,In suchstrong fields the effects of quantum mechanics should be important
2412,Thus in a sense classical general relativity bypredicting points of infinite density predicts its own downfall just as classical that is nonquantum mechanics predictedits downfall by suggesting that atoms should collapse to infinite density
2413,We do not yet have a complete consistent theorythat unifies general relativity and quantum mechanics but we do know a number of the features it should have
2414,Theconsequences that these would have for black holes and the big bang will be described in later chapters
2415,html  of    AM A Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
2416,html  of    AMCHAPTER  ELEMENTARY PARTICLES AND THE FORCES OF NATURE   Aristotle believed that all the matter in the universe was made up of four basic elements  earth air fire and water
2417,These elements were acted on by two forces gravity the tendency for earth and water to sink and levity the tendencyfor air and fire to rise
2418,This division of the contents of the universe into matter and forces is still used today
2419,Aristotlebelieved that matter was continuous that is one could divide a piece of matter into smaller and smaller bits without anylimit one never came up against a grain of matter that could not be divided further
2420,For centuries the argument continued without any real evidence on either side but in  the British chemist and physicist John Dalton pointed out that the fact that chemicalcompounds always combined in certain proportions could be explained by the grouping together of atoms to form unitscalled molecules
2421,One of the important pieces of physical evidence was provided by Einstein
2422,By this time there were already suspicions that these atoms were not after all indivisible
2423,Thomson had demonstrated the existence of a particle of matter called theelectron that had a mass less than one thousandth of that of the lightest atom
2424,He used a setup rather like a modern TVpicture tube a redhot metal filament gave off the electrons and because these have a negative electric charge anelectric field could be used to accelerate them toward a phosphorcoated screen
2425,He later resigned as Master because ofdisagreements with the Fellows
2426,There had been a bitter dispute in the college ever since a group of young Fellowsreturning after the war had voted many of the old Fellows out of the college offices they had held for a long time
2427,The origin of the name is an enigmatic quotation from James Joyce Three quarks forMuster Mark The word quark is supposed to be pronounced like quart but with a k at the end instead of a t but is usually pronounced to rhyme with lark
2428,The first three flavors had been known since the s but the charmed quark was discovered only in the bottom in  and the top in
2429,Each flavor comes in three colors red green and blue
2430,It should beemphasized that these terms are just labels quarks are much smaller than the wavelength of visible light and so do nothave any color in the normal sense
2431,It is just that modern physicists seem to have more imaginative ways of naming newparticles and phenomena  they no longer restrict themselves to Greek A proton or neutron is made up of three quarksone of each color
2432,A proton contains two up quarks and one down quark a neutron contains two down and one up
2433,Wecan create particles made up of the other quarks strange charmed bottom and top but these all have a much greatermass and decay very rapidly into protons and neutrons
2434,We now know that neither the atoms nor the protons and neutrons within them are indivisible
2435,html  of    AMis much larger than the size of an atom we cannot hope to look at the parts of an atom in the ordinary way
2436,As we saw in the last chapter quantum mechanics tells us that allparticles are in fact waves and that the higher the energy of a particle the smaller the wavelength of the correspondingwave
2437,These particle energies are usually measured in unitscalled electron volts
2438,In Thomsons experiments with electrons we saw that he used an electric field to accelerate theelectrons
2439,In Rutherfordsexperiment the alphaparticles had energies of millions of electron volts
2440,And sowe know that particles that were thought to be elementary thirty years ago are in fact made up of smaller particles
2441,May these as we go to still higher energies in turn be found to be made from still smaller particles This is certainlypossible but we do have some theoretical reasons for believing that we have or are very near to a knowledge of theultimate building blocks of nature
2442,Using the waveparticle duality discussed in the last chapter everything in the universe including light and gravity canbe described in terms of particles
2443,One way of thinking of spin is to imaginethe particles as little tops spinning about an axis
2444,A particle of spin  is like a dot it looks the same from every direction Figure i
2445,On the other hand a particle of spin  is like an arrow it looks different from different directions Figure ii
2446,Only if one turns it round a complete revolution  degrees does the particle look the same
2447,A particle of spin  is like a doubleheaded arrowFigure iii  it looks the same if one turns it round half a revolution  degrees
2448,Similarly higher spin particles look the same if one turns them through smaller fractions of a complete revolution
2449,All this seems fairly straightforward but theremarkable fact is that there are particles that do not look the same if one turns them through just one revolution youhave to turn them through two complete revolutions Such particles are said to have spin
2450,He was the archetypal theoretical physicist it was saidof him that even his presence in the same town would make experiments go wrong Paulis exclusion principle says thattwo similar particles cannot exist in the same state that is they cannot have both the same position and the samevelocity within the limits given by the uncertainty principle
2451,If the world had been created without the exclusion principlequarks would not form separate welldefined protons and neutrons
2452,They would all collapse to form a roughly uniform dense soup
2453,Diracs theory was the first of its kind that was consistentwith both quantum mechanics and the special theory of relativity
2454,It also predicted that the electron should have a partner an antielectron or positron
2455,Thediscovery of the positron in  confirmed Diracs theory and led to his being awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in
2456,In the case of the forcecarryingparticles the antiparticles are the same as the particles themselves
2457,html  of    AMimportant and I shall return to it later in the chapter
2458,In quantum mechanics the forces or interactions between matter particles are all supposed to be carried by particles ofinteger spin    or
2459,The recoil from this emission changes the velocity of the matter particle
2460,The forcecarrying particle then collideswith another matter particle and is absorbed
2461,This collision changes the velocity of the second particle just as if there hadbeen a force between the two matter particles
2462,It is an important property of  the forcecarrying particles that they do notobey the exclusion principle
2463,This means that there is no limit to the number that can be exchanged and so they can giverise to a strong force
2464,So the forces that they carry will have only a short range
2465,On the other hand if theforcecarrying particles have no mass of their own the forces will be long range
2466,The forcecarrying particles exchangedbetween matter particles are said to be virtual particles because unlike real particles they cannot be directly detectedby a particle detector
2467,It should be emphasized that this division into four classes is manmade it isconvenient for the construction of partial theories but it may not correspond to anything deeper
2468,Ultimately mostphysicists hope to find a unified theory that will explain all four forces as different aspects of a single force
2469,Indeed manywould say this is the prime goal of physics today
2470,Recently successful attempts have been made to unify three of thefour categories of force  and I shall describe these in this chapter
2471,The question of the unification of the remainingcategory gravity we shall leave till later
2472,This force is universal that is every particle feels the force of gravityaccording to its mass or energy
2473,Gravity is the weakest of the four forces by a long way it is so weak that we would notnotice it at all were it not for two special properties that it has it can act over large distances and it is always attractive
2474,This means that the very weak gravitational forces between the individual particles in two large bodies such as the earthand the sun can all add up to produce a significant force
2475,The other three forces are either short range or are sometimesattractive and sometimes repulsive so they tend to cancel out
2476,In the quantum mechanical way of looking at thegravitational field the force between two matter particles is pictured as being carried by a particle of spin  called thegraviton
2477,This has no mass of its own so the force that it carries is long range
2478,The gravitational force between the sunand the earth is ascribed to the exchange of gravitons between the particles that make up these two bodies
2479,It is much stronger than the gravitational force theelectromagnetic force between two electrons is about a million million million million million million million  with fortytwozeros after it times bigger than the gravitational force
2480,The force between two positive charges is repulsive as is the force between two negative charges but theforce is attractive between a positive and a negative charge
2481,A large body such as the earth or the sun contains nearlyequal numbers of positive and negative charges
2482,Thus the attractive and repulsive forces between the individual particlesnearly cancel each other out and there is very little net electromagnetic force
2483,The electromagnetic attraction between negatively charged electronsand positively charged protons in the nucleus causes the electrons to orbit the nucleus of the atom just as gravitationalattraction causes the earth to orbit the sun
2484,The electromagnetic attraction is pictured as being caused by the exchangeof large numbers of virtual massless particles of spin  called photons
2485,Equally if a real photon collides with an atom it maymove an electron from an orbit nearer the nucleus to one farther away
2486,This uses up the energy of the photon so it isabsorbed
2487,html  of    AMproposed theories that unified this interaction with the electromagnetic force just as Maxwell had unified electricity andmagnetism about a hundred years earlier
2488,They suggested that in addition to the photon there were three other spinparticles known collectively as massive vector bosons that carried the weak force
2489,These were called W  pronounced W plus W pronounced W minus and Z pronounced Z naught and each had a mass of around  GeV GeV stands for gigaelectronvolt or one thousand million electron volts
2490,The WeinbergSalam theory exhibits a propertyknown as spontaneous symmetry breaking
2491,The effect is rather like the behavior of a roulette ball on a roulette wheel
2492,But as the wheelslows the energy of the ball decreases and eventually the ball drops into one of the thirtyseven slots in the wheel
2493,If for some reason wecould only observe the ball at low energies we would then think that there were thirtyseven different types of ballIn the WeinbergSalam theory at energies much greater than  GeV the three new particles and the photon would allbehave in a similar manner
2494,But at the lower particle energies that occur in most normal situations this symmetrybetween the particles would be broken
2495,WE W and Z would acquire large masses making the forces they carry have avery short range
2496,At the time that Salam and Weinberg proposed their theory few people believed them and particleaccelerators were not powerful enough to reach the energies of  GeV required to produce real W  W or Z particles
2497,The Nobel committee was spared the embarrassment of having made a mistake by the discovery in  at CERNEuropean Centre for Nuclear Research of the three massive partners of the photon with the correct predicted massesand other properties
2498,The strong nuclear force has a curious propertycalled confinement it always binds particles together into combinations that have no color
2499,One cannot have a singlequark on its own because it would have a color red green or blue
2500,Instead a red quark has to be joined to a green anda blue quark by a string of gluons red  green  blue  white
2501,Anotherpossibility is a pair consisting of a quark and an antiquark red  antired or green  antigreen or blue  antiblue  white
2502,Similarly confinement prevents one having a single gluonon its own because gluons also have color
2503,Such a collection forms an unstable particle called a glueball
2504,At normal energies thestrong nuclear force is indeed strong and it binds the quarks tightly together
2505,This title is rather an exaggeration the resultant theoriesare not all that grand nor are they fully unified as they do not include gravity
2506,Nevertheless they may be a step toward a complete fully unified theory
2507,The basic idea ofGUTs is as follows as was mentioned above the strong nuclear force gets weaker at high energies
2508,At some very highenergy called the grand unification energy these three forces would all have the same strength and so could just bedifferent aspects of a single force
2509,The GUTs also predict that at this energy the different spin matter particles likequarks and electrons would also all be essentially the same thus achieving another unification
2510,The value of the grand unification energy is not very well known but it would probably have to be at least a thousandmillion million GeV
2511,The present generation of particle accelerators can collide particles at energies of about one hundredGeV and machines are planned that would raise this to a few thousand GeV
2512,But a machine that was powerful enough toaccelerate particles to the grand unification energy would have to be as big as the Solar System  and would be unlikelyto be funded in the present economic climate
2513,Thus it is impossible to test grand unified theories directly in the laboratory
2514,The reason this is possible is that at the grandunification energy there is no essential difference between a quark and an antielectron
2515,The three quarks inside a protonnormally do not have enough energy to change into antielectrons but very occasionally one of them may acquireA Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
2516,html  of    AMsufficient energy to make the transition because the uncertainty principle means that the energy of the quarks inside theproton cannot be fixed exactly
2517,The probability of a quark gaining sufficient energy is solow that one is likely to have to wait at least a million million million million million years  followed by thirty zeros
2518,Thus one might think that the possibility of spontaneous proton decay could not be tested experimentally
2519,If for example one observed a number of protons equal to  followed by thirtyone zeros for a period of oneyear one would expect according to the simplest GUT to observe more than one proton decay
2520,A number of such experiments have been carried out but none have yielded definite evidence of proton or neutrondecay
2521,One experiment used eight thousand tons of water and was performed in the Morton Salt Mine in Ohio to avoidother events taking place caused by cosmic rays that might be confused with proton decay
2522,Since no spontaneousproton decay had been observed during the experiment one can calculate that the probable life of the proton must begreater than ten million million million million million years  with thirtyone zeros
2523,Still more sensitive experiments involving even larger quantities of matter will be needed to test them
2524,There are no antiprotons or antineutronsmade up from antiquarks except for a few that physicists produce in large particle accelerators
2525,We have evidence fromcosmic rays that the same is true for all the matter in our galaxy there are no antiprotons or antineutrons apart from asmall number that are produced as particle antiparticle pairs in highenergy collisions
2526,We have no direct evidence as to whether the matter in other galaxies is made up of protons and neutrons or antiprotonsand antineutrons but it must be one or the other there cannot be a mixture in a single galaxy because in that case wewould again observe a lot of radiation from annihilations
2527,We therefore believe that all galaxies are composed of quarksrather than antiquarks it seems implausible that some galaxies should be matter and some antimatter
2528,As we have seen GUTs allow quarks to change into antielectrons at highenergy
2529,They also allow the reverse processes antiquarks turning into electrons and electrons and antielectrons turninginto antiquarks and quarks
2530,Up to  it was believed that the laws of physics obeyed each of three separate symmetries called C P and T
2531,Thesymmetry C means that the laws are the same for particles and antiparticles
2532,The symmetry P means that the laws arethe same for any situation and its mirror image the mirror image of a particle spinning in a righthanded direction is onespinning in a lefthanded direction
2533,In  two American physicists TsungDao Lee and Chen Ning Yangsuggested that the weak force does not in fact obey the symmetry P
2534,The sameyear a colleague ChienShiung Wu proved their prediction correct
2535,The following year Lee and Yang received the Nobel Prize for their idea
2536,It wasalso found that the weak force did not obey the symmetry C
2537,That is it would cause a universe composed of antiparticlesto behave differently from our universe
2538,Nevertheless it seemed that the weak force did obey the combined symmetryCP
2539,Cronin and Val Fitch discovered that even the CPsymmetry was not obeyed in the decay of certain particles called Kmesons
2540,Cronin and Fitch eventually received theNobel Prize for their work in
2541,html  of    AMThere is a mathematical theorem that says that any theory that obeys quantum mechanics and relativity must alwaysobey the combined symmetry CPT
2542,In other words the universe would have to behave the same if one replaced particlesby antiparticles took the mirror image and also reversed the direction of time
2543,The laws of physics therefore must change if one reverses the direction of time  they do not obey the symmetry T
2544,Certainly the early universe does not obey the symmetry T as time runs forward the universe expands  if it ranbackward the universe would be contracting
2545,And since there are forces that do not obey the symmetry T it follows thatas the universe expands these forces could cause more antielectrons to turn into quarks than electrons into antiquarks
2546,Then as the universe expanded and cooled the antiquarks would annihilate with the quarks but since there would bemore quarks than antiquarks a small excess of quarks would remain
2547,Thus our very existence could be regarded as a confirmation of grand unifiedtheories though a qualitative one only the uncertainties are such that one cannot predict the numbers of quarks that willbe left after the annihilation or even whether it would be quarks or antiquarks that would remain
2548,Grand unified theories do not include the force of gravity
2549,So for a sufficiently large number ofmatter particles gravitational forces can dominate over all other forces
2550,Even for objects the size of stars the attractive force of gravity can win over all the other forcesand cause the star to collapse
2551,My work in the s focused on the black holes that can result from such stellar collapseand the intense gravitational fields around them
2552,html  of    AMCHAPTER  BLACK HOLES   The term black hole is of very recent origin
2553,By the waveparticle duality of quantum mechanics light can be regarded asboth a wave and a particle
2554,But if light is composed of particles one might expect them to be affected by gravity in the same way thatcannonballs rockets and planets are
2555,At first people thought that particles of light traveled infinitely fast so gravitywould not have been able to slow them down but the discovery by Roemer that light travels at a finite speed meant thatgravity might have an important effect
2556,Michell suggested that there might be a largenumber of stars like this
2557,Although we would not be able to see them because the light from them would not reach uswe would still feel their gravitational attraction
2558,A similar suggestion was made a few years later by the French scientist the Marquis deLaplace apparently independently of Michell
2559,Interestingly enough Laplace included it in only the first and secondeditions of his book The System of the World and left it out of later editions perhaps he decided that it was a crazy idea
2560,Also the particle theory of light went out of favor during the nineteenth century it seemed that everything couldbe explained by the wave theory and according to the wave theory it was not clear that light would be affected bygravity at all
2561,In fact it is not really consistent to treat light like cannonballs in Newtons theory of gravity because the speed of light isfixed
2562,Andeven then it was a long time before the implications of the theory for massive stars were understood
2563,Asit contracts the atoms of the gas collide with each other more and more frequently and at greater and greater speeds the gas heats up
2564,This additional heat also increases the pressure of the gas until it issufficient to balance the gravitational attraction and the gas stops contracting
2565,Stars will remain stable like this for a long time with heat from thenuclear reactions balancing the gravitational attraction
2566,Paradoxically the more fuel a star starts off with the sooner it runs out
2567,This is because the moremassive the star is the hotter it needs to be to balance its gravitational attraction
2568,And the hotter it is the faster it willuse up its fuel
2569,Our sun has probably got enough fuel for another five thousand million years or so but more massivestars can use up their fuel in as little as one hundred million years much less than the age of the universe
2570,In  an Indian graduate student Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar set sail for England to study at Cambridge with theBritish astronomer Sir Arthur Eddington an expert on general relativity
2571,This makes them move away fromeach other and so tends to make the star expand
2572,A star can therefore maintain itself at a constant radius by a balancebetween the attraction of gravity and the repulsion that arises from the exclusion principle just as earlier in its lifeA Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
2573,Thetheory of relativity limits the maximum difference in the velocities of the matter particles in the star to the speed of light
2574,Chandrasekhar calculated that a cold star of more than about one and a half times the mass ofthe sun would not be able to support itself against its own gravity
2575,A similar discovery was made about the same time by the Russian scientist Lev Davidovich Landau
2576,This had serious implications for the ultimate fate of massive stars
2577,If a stars mass is less than the Chandrasekhar limitit can eventually stop contracting and settle down to a possible final state as a white dwarf with a radius of a fewthousand miles and a density of hundreds of tons per cubic inch
2578,A white dwarf is supported by the exclusion principlerepulsion between the electrons in its matter
2579,We observe a large number of these white dwarf stars
2580,One of the first tobe discovered is a star that is orbiting around Sirius the brightest star in the night sky
2581,Landau pointed out that there was another possible final state for a star also with a limiting mass of about one or twotimes the mass of the sun but much smaller even than a white dwarf
2582,These stars would be supported by the exclusionprinciple repulsion between neutrons and protons rather than between electrons
2583,They would have a radius of only ten miles or so and a density of hundreds of millions of tons per cubic inch
2584,Atthe time they were first predicted there was no way that neutron stars could be observed
2585,Eddington thought it was simply not possible that a star could collapse to a point
2586,Thehostility of other scientists particularly Eddington his former teacher and the leading authority on the structure of starspersuaded Chandrasekhar to abandon this line of work and turn instead to other problems in astronomy such as themotion of star clusters
2587,Then World War IIintervened and Oppenheimer himself became closely involved in the atom bomb project
2588,Oppenheimers work was then rediscovered and extended by a number of people
2589,The picture that we now have from Oppenheimers work is as follows
2590,This can be seen in the bending of light from distant stars observed during an eclipse of the sun
2591,Asthe star contracts the gravitational field at its surface gets stronger and the light cones get bent inward more
2592,Thismakes it more difficult for light from the star to escape and the light appears dimmer and redder to an observer at adistance
2593,html  of    AMFigure  According to the theory of relativity nothing can travel faster than light
2594,Thus if light cannot escape neither can anythingelse everything is dragged back by the gravitational field
2595,Its boundaryis called the event horizon and it coincides with the paths of light rays that just fail to escape from the black hole
2596,The timefor someone on a star will be different from that for someone at a distance because of the gravitational field of the star
2597,html  of    AMSuppose an intrepid astronaut on the surface of the collapsing star collapsing inward with it sent a signal everysecond according to his watch to his spaceship orbiting about the star
2598,As  approached his companions watching from the spaceship wouldfind the intervals between successive signals from the astronaut getting longer and longer but this effect would be verysmall before
2599,The light waves emitted from the surface of the star between  and  by the astronauts watch would bespread out over an infinite period of time as seen from the spaceship
2600,The time interval between the arrival ofsuccessive waves at the spaceship would get longer and longer so the light from the star would appear redder andredder and fainter and fainter
2601,Eventually the star would be so dim that it could no longer be seen from the spaceshipall that would be left would be a black hole in space
2602,Gravity gets weaker the farther you are from the star so the gravitational force on ourintrepid astronauts feet would always be greater than the force on his head
2603,This is rather like the big bang at thebeginning of time only it would be an end of time for the collapsing body and the astronaut
2604,At this singularity the lawsof science and our ability to predict the future would break down
2605,This would offer great possibilities for travel in space and time but unfortunately it seems thatthese solutions may all be highly unstable the least disturbance such as the presence of an astronaut may changethem so that the astronaut could not see the singularity until he hit it and his time came to an end
2606,In other words thesingularity would always lie in his future and never in his past
2607,The strong version of the cosmic censorship hypothesisstates that in a realistic solution the singularities would always lie either entirely in the future like the singularities ofgravitational collapse or entirely in the past like the  big bang
2608,I strongly believe in cosmic censorship so I bet KipThorne and John Preskill of Cal Tech that it would always hold
2609,I lost the bet on a technicality because examples wereproduced of solutions with a singularity that was visible from a long way away
2610,The naked singularities wereunstable the least disturbance would cause them either to disappear or to be hidden behind an event horizon
2611,Remember that the eventhorizon is the path in spacetime of light that is trying to escape from the black hole and nothing can travel faster thanlight
2612,General relativity predicts that heavy objects that are moving will cause the emission of gravitational waves ripples inthe curvature of space that travel at the speed of light
2613,They can be observed by the very slight change in separationthey produce between neighboring freely moving objects
2614,A number of detectors are being built in the United StatesA Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
2615,html  of    AMEurope and Japan that will measure displacements of one part in a thousand million million million  with twentyonezeros after it or less than the nucleus of an atom over a distance of ten miles
2616,Like light gravitational waves carry energy away from the objects that emit them
2617,One would therefore expect a systemof massive objects to settle down eventually to a stationary state because the energy in any movement would becarried away by the emission of gravitational waves
2618,It is rather like dropping a cork into water at first it bobs up anddown a great deal but as the ripples carry away its energy it eventually settles down to a stationary state
2619,Forexample the movement of the earth in its orbit round the sun produces gravitational waves
2620,The effect of the energyloss will be to change the orbit of the earth so that gradually it gets nearer and nearer to the sun eventually collides withit and settles down to a stationary state
2621,The rate of energy loss in the case of the earth and the sun is very low  aboutenough to run a small electric heater
2622,This means it will take about a thousand million million million million years for theearth to run into the sun so theres no immediate cause for worry The change in the orbit of the earth is too slow to beobserved but this same effect has been observed over the past few years occurring in the system called PSR   PSR stands for pulsar a special type of neutron star that emits regular pulses of radio waves
2623,This system contains two neutron stars orbiting each other and the energy they are losing by the emission of gravitational waves iscausing them to spiral in toward each other
2624,Just before they do they will beorbiting so fast that they will emit enough gravitational waves for detectors like LIGO to pick up
2625,It would therefore not be too long  before it settled down to astationary state
2626,And if black holes were as variedas the objects that collapsed to form them it might be very difficult to make any predictions about black holes ingeneral
2627,They could in fact be described by aparticular solution of Einsteins equations that had been known since  found by Karl Schwarzschild shortly afterthe discovery of general relativity
2628,At first many people including Israel himself argued that since black holes had to beperfectly spherical a black hole could only form from the collapse of a perfectly spherical object
2629,They argued that the rapid movements involved in a stars collapse would mean that thegravitational waves it gave off would make it ever more spherical and by the time it had settled down to a stationarystate it would be precisely spherical
2630,Further calculations supported this view and it soon came to be adopted generally
2631,Israels result dealt with the case of black holes formed from nonrotating bodies only
2632,In  Roy Kerr a NewZealander found a set of solutions of the equations of general relativity that described rotating black holes
2633,TheseKerr black holes rotate at a constant rate their size and shape depending only on their mass and rate of rotation
2634,If therotation is zero the black hole is perfectly round and the solution is identical to the Schwarzschild solution
2635,If therotation is nonzero the black hole bulges outward near its equator just as the earth or the sun bulge due to theirrotation and the faster it rotates the more it bulges
2636,So to extend Israels result to include rotating bodies it wasconjectured that any rotating body that collapsed to form a black hole would eventually settle down to a stationary statedescribed by the Kerr solution
2637,In  a colleague and fellow research student of mine at Cambridge Brandon Cartertook the first step toward proving this conjecture
2638,Then in  Iproved that any stationary rotating black hole would indeed have such an axis of symmetry
2639,Moreover its size and shape would depend only on its mass and rate ofrotation and not on the nature of the body that had collapsed to form it
2640,This result became known by the maxim Ablack hole has no hair
2641,The no hair theorem is of great practical importance because it so greatly restricts thepossible types of black holes
2642,One can therefore make detailed models of objects that might contain black holes andcompare the predictions of the models with observations
2643,It also means that a very large amount of information aboutA Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
2644,The significance of this will be seen in the next chapter
2645,He found it was too large to be caused by a gravitational field if it had been a gravitational red shift the object wouldhave to be so massive and so near to us that it would disturb the orbits of planets in the Solar System
2646,And to be visible at such a great distance the object must be very bright must in other words beemitting a huge amount of energy
2647,Anumber of other similar quasistellar objects or quasars have been discovered all with large red shifts
2648,But they areall too far away and therefore too difficult to observe to provide conclusive evidence of black holes
2649,Further encouragement for the existence of black holes came in  with the discovery by a research student atCambridge Jocelyn BellBurnell of objects in the sky that were emitting regular pulses of radio waves
2650,If a star could collapse to such asmall size it is not unreasonable to expect that other stars could collapse to even smaller size and become black holes
2651,As John Michell pointed out in his pioneering paper in a black hole still exerts a gravitational fierce on nearby objects
2652,One cannot of course immediatelyconclude that the companion is a black hole it might merely be a star that is too faint to be seen
2653,html  of    AMFigure  The best explanation for this phenomenon is that matter has been blown off the surface of the visible star
2654,As it fallstoward the unseen companion it develops a spiral motion rather like water running out of a bath and it gets very hotemitting Xrays Figure
2655,html  of    AMFigure  For this mechanism to work the unseen object has to be very small like a white dwarf neutron star or black hole
2656,From the observed orbit of the visible star one can determine the lowest possible mass of the unseen object
2657,It is also too large a mass to be a neutron star
2658,There are other models to explain Cygnus X that do not include a black hole but they are all rather farfetched
2659,Ablack hole seems to be the only really natural explanation of the observations
2660,Despite this I had a bet with Kip Thorneof the California Institute of Technology that in fact Cygnus X does not contain a black hole This was a form finsurance policy for me
2661,I have done a lot of work on black holes and it would all be wasted if it turned out that blackholes do not exist
2662,In fact although the situation with Cygnus X has not changed much since we made the bet in  there is now so much other observational evidence in favor of black holes that I have conceded the bet
2663,We also now have evidence for several other black holes in systems like Cygnus X in our galaxy and in twoneighboring galaxies called the Magellanic Clouds
2664,html  of    AMhave some evidence that there is a much larger black hole with a mass of about a hundred thousand times that of thesun at the center of our galaxy
2665,Stars in the galaxy that come too near this black hole will be torn apart by thedifference in the gravitational forces on their near and far sides
2666,Their remains and gas that is thrown off other stars willfall toward the black hole
2667,As in the case of Cygnus Xl the gas will spiral inward and will heat up though not as muchas in that case
2668,It will not get hot enough to emit X rays but it could account for the very compact source of radio wavesand infrared rays that is observed at the galactic center
2669,It is thought that similar but even larger black holes with masses of about a hundred million times the mass of the sunoccur at the centers of quasars
2670,For example observations with the Hubble telescope of the galaxy known as Mreveal that it contains a disk of gas  lightyears across rotating about a central object two thousand million times themass of the sun
2671,Matter falling into such a supermassive black hole would provide theonly source of power great enough to explain the enormous amounts of energy that these objects are emitting
2672,As thematter spirals into the black hole it would make the black hole rotate in the same direction causing it to develop amagnetic field rather like that of the earth
2673,Very highenergy particles would be generated near the black hole by theinfalling matter
2674,The magnetic field would be so strong that it could focus these particles into jets ejected outward alongthe axis of rotation of the black hole that is in the directions of its north and south poles
2675,Such jets are indeed observedin a number of galaxies and quasars
2676,One can also consider the possibility that there might be black holes with massesmuch less than that of the sun
2677,Lowmass black holes could form only if matter was compressed toenormous densities by very large external pressures
2678,Such conditions could occur in a very big hydrogen bomb thephysicist John Wheeler once calculated that if one took all the heavy water in all the oceans of the world one couldbuild a hydrogen bomb that would compress matter at the center so much that a black hole would be created
2679,Ofcourse there would be no one left to observe it A more practical possibility is that such lowmass black holes mighthave been formed in the high temperatures and pressures of the very early universe
2680,Black holes would have beenformed only if the early universe had not been perfectly smooth and uniform because only a small region that wasdenser than average could be compressed in this way to form a black hole
2681,But we know that there must have beensome irregularities because otherwise the matter in the universe would still be perfectly uniformly distributed at thepresent epoch instead of being clumped together in stars and galaxies
2682,Whether the irregularities required to account for stars and galaxies would have led to the formation of a significantnumber of primordial black holes clearly depends on the details of the conditions in the early universe
2683,Primordial black holes with masses more than a thousand million tons the mass of a large mountain couldbe detected only by their gravitational influence on other visible matter or on the expansion of the universe
2684,So paradoxically smaller black holes might actually turn out to be easier to detect thanlarge ones   PREVIOUS NEXT   A Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
2685,html  of    AMCHAPTER  BLACK HOLES AINT SO BLACK   Before  my research on general relativity had concentrated mainly on the question of whether or not there hadbeen a big bang singularity
2686,My disability makes this rather a slow process so I hadplenty of time
2687,It meansthat the boundary of the black hole the event horizon is formed by the light rays that just fail to escape from the blackhole hovering forever just on the edge Figure
2688,It is a bit like running away from the police and just managing to keep one step ahead but not being able to get clear away Figure  Suddenly I realized that the paths of these light rays could never approach one another
2689,It would be like meeting someone else running away from the police in the oppositedirection  you would both be caught Or in this case fall into a black hole
2690,But if these light rays were swallowed upby the black hole then they could not have been on the boundary of the black hole
2691,So the paths of light rays in theA Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
2692,html  of    AMevent horizon had always to be moving parallel to or away from each other
2693,Another way of seeing this is that theevent horizon the boundary of the black hole is like the edge of a shadow  the shadow of impending doom
2694,If youlook at the shadow cast by a source at a great distance such as the sun you will see that the rays of light in the edgeare not approaching each other
2695,If the rays of light that form the event horizon the boundary of the black hole can never approach each other the areaof the event horizon might stay the same or increase with time but it could never decrease because that would meanthat at least some of the rays of light in the boundary would have to be approaching each other
2696,Figures    Or if two black holes collided and merged together to form a single black hole the area of the event horizon of the finalblack hole would be greater than or equal to the sum of the areas of the event horizons of the original black holesFigure
2697,This nondecreasing property of the event horizons area placed an important restriction on the possible behavior of black holes
2698,I was so excited with my discovery that I did not get much sleep that night
2699,I think in fact that he had been aware of this property of the area
2700,He had not realized that the boundaries of the blackA Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
2701,It is a matter of common experience that disorder willtend to increase if things are left to themselves
2702,One has only to stop making repairs around the house to see thatOne can create order out of disorder for example one can paint the house but that requires expenditure of effort orenergy and so decreases the amount of ordered energy available
2703,A precise statement of this idea is known as the second law of thermodynamics
2704,For example consider a system of gas molecules in abox
2705,The molecules can be thought of as little billiard balls continually colliding with each other and bouncing off thewalls of the box
2706,The higher the temperature of the gas the faster the molecules move and so the more frequently andharder they collide with the walls of the box and the greater the outward pressure they exert on the walls
2707,Suppose thatinitially the molecules are all confined to the lefthand side of the box by a partition
2708,If the partition is then removed themolecules will tend to spread out and occupy both halves of the box
2709,At some later time they could by chance all be inthe right half or back in the left half but it is overwhelmingly more probable that there will be roughly equal numbers inthe two halves
2710,One therefore says that the entropy of the gas has gone up
2711,Similarly suppose one starts with two boxesone containing oxygen molecules and the other containing nitrogen molecules
2712,If one joins the boxes together andremoves the intervening wall the oxygen and the nitrogen molecules will start to mix
2713,At a later time the most probablestate would be a fairly uniform mixture of oxygen and nitrogen molecules throughout the two boxes
2714,This state wouldbe less ordered and hence have more entropy than the initial state of two separate boxes
2715,The second law of thermodynamics has a rather different status than that of other laws of science such as Newtonslaw of gravity for example because it does not hold always just in the vast majority of cases
2716,The probability of all thegas molecules in our first boxfound in one half of the box at a later time is many millions of millions to one but it can happen
2717,The total entropy of matter outside  the black hole would go down
2718,As matter carrying entropy fell into a black hole the area of its event horizon would goup so that the sum of the entropy of matter outside black holes and the area of the horizons would never go down
2719,This suggestion seemed to prevent the second law of thermodynamics from being violated in most situations
2720,If a black hole has entropy then it ought to also have a temperature
2721,But a bodywith a particular temperature must emit radiation at a certain rate
2722,It is a matter of common experience that if one heatsup a poker in a fire it glows red hot and emits radiation but bodies at lower temperatures emit radiation too one justdoes not normally notice it because the amount is fairly small
2723,This radiation is required in order to prevent violation ofthe second law
2724,But by their very definition black holes are objects that are notsupposed to emit anything
2725,It therefore seemed that the area of the event horizon of a black hole could not be regardedas its entropy
2726,In September  while I was visiting Moscow I discussed black holes with two leading Soviet experts YakovZeldovich and Alexander Starobinsky
2727,They convinced me that according to the quantum mechanical uncertaintyprinciple rotating black holes should create and emit particles
2728,I was expecting to discover just theradiation that Zeldovich and Starobinsky had predicted from rotating black holes
2729,html  of    AMfound to my surprise and annoyance that even nonrotating black holes should apparently create and emit particles ata steady rate
2730,At first I thought that this emission indicated that one of the approximations I had used was not valid
2731,Since then the calculations have beenrepeated in a number of different forms by other people
2732,They all confirm that a black hole ought to emit particles andradiation as if it were a hot body with a temperature that depends only on the black holes mass the higher the massthe lower the temperature
2733,So in empty space the fieldcannot be fixed at exactly zero because then it would have both a precise value zero and a precise rate of changealso zero
2734,There must be a certain minimum amount of uncertainty or quantum fluctuations in the value of the field
2735,One can think of these fluctuations as pairs of particles of light or gravity that appear together at some time moveapart and then come together again and annihilate each other
2736,These particles are virtual particles like the particlesthat carry the gravitational force of the sun unlike real particles they cannot be observed directly with a particledetector
2737,The uncertainty principle alsopredicts that there will be similar virtual pairs of matter particles such as electrons or quarks
2738,Because energy cannot be created out of nothing one of the partners in a particleantiparticle pair will have positiveenergy and the other partner negative energy
2739,The one with negative energy is condemned to be a shortlived virtualparticle because real particles always have positive energy in normal situations
2740,It must therefore seek out its partnerand annihilate with it
2741,Normally the energy ofthe particle is still positive but the gravitational field inside a black hole is so strong that even a real particle can havenegative energy there
2742,It is therefore possible if a black hole is present for the virtual particle with negative energy tofall into the black hole and become a real particle or antiparticle
2743,In this case it no longer has to annihilate with itspartner
2744,Its forsaken partner may fall into the black hole as well
2745,Or having positive energy it might also escape fromthe vicinity of the black hole as a real particle or antiparticle Figure
2746,html  of    AMFigure  To an observer at a distance it will appear to have been emitted from the black hole
2747,The smaller the black hole theshorter the distance the particle with negative energy will have to go before it becomes a real particle and thus thegreater the rate of emission and the apparent temperature of the black hole
2748,The positive energy of the outgoing radiation would be balanced by a flow of negative energy particles into the blackhole
2749,A flow of negative energy into the black hole therefore reduces its mass
2750,As the black hole loses mass thearea of its event horizon gets smaller but this decrease in the entropy of the black hole is more than compensated forby the entropy of the emitted radiation so the second law is never violated
2751,Moreover the lower the mass of the black hole the higher its temperature
2752,So as the black hole loses mass itstemperature and rate of emission increase so it loses mass more quickly
2753,A black hole with a mass a few times that of the sun would have a temperature of only one ten millionth of a degreeabove absolute zero
2754,This is much less than the temperature of the microwave radiation that fills the universe aboutA Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
2755,above absolute zero so such black holes would emit even less than they absorb
2756,But even then its temperature would be so low that it would take abouta million million million million million million million million million million million years  with sixtysix zeros after it toevaporate completely
2757,On the other hand as mentioned in Chapter  there might be primordialblack holes with a very much smaller mass that were made by the collapse of irregularities in the very early stages ofthe universe
2758,Such black holes would have a much higher temperature and would be emitting radiation at a muchgreater rate
2759,A primordial black hole with an initial mass of a thousand million tons would have a lifetime roughly equalto the age of the universe
2760,Primordial black holes with initial masses less than this figure would already havecompletely evaporated but those with slightly greater masses would still be emitting radiation in the form of X rays andgamma rays
2761,These X rays and gamma rays are like waves of light but with a much shorter wavelength
2762,Such holeshardly deserve the epithet black they really are white hot and are emitting energy at a rate of about ten thousandmegawatts
2763,One such black hole could run ten large power stations if only we could harness its power
2764,It would oscillate through the earth and backuntil eventually it settled down at the center
2765,This does notsound like a very practical proposition at least not in the immediate future
2766,Although theradiation from most would be very weak because they are far away the total from all of them might be detectable
2767,One can therefore say that the observations of the gamma ray background do not provide any positiveevidence for primordial black holes but they do tell us that on average there cannot be more than  in every cubiclightyear in the universe
2768,This limit means that primordial black holes could make up at most one millionth of thematter in the universe
2769,html  of    AMFigure  With primordial black holes being so scarce it might seem unlikely that there would be one near enough for us toobserve as an individual source of gamma rays
2770,But since gravity would draw primordial black holes toward any matterthey should be much more common in and around galaxies
2771,If they were say a million times more common than this then the nearest black holeto us would probably be at a distance of about a thousand million kilometers or about as far away as Pluto the farthestknown planet
2772,At this distance it would still be very difficult to detect the steady emission of a black hole even if it wasten thousand megawatts
2773,In order to observe a primordial black hole one would have to detect several gamma rayquanta coming from the same direction within a reasonable space of time such as a week
2774,But Plancks quantum principle tells us that each gamma ray quantum has a veryhigh energy because gamma rays have a very high frequency so it would not take many quanta to radiate even tenthousand megawatts
2775,And to observe these few coming from the distance of Pluto would require a larger gamma raydetector than any that have been constructed so far
2776,Moreover the detector would have to be in space becausegamma rays cannot penetrate the atmosphere
2777,Of course if a black hole as close as Pluto were to reach the end of its life and blow up it would be easy to detect thefinal burst of emission
2778,But if the black hole has been emitting for the last ten or twenty thousand million years thechance of it reaching the end of its life within the next few years rather than several million years in the past or futureis really rather small So in order to have a reasonable chance of seeing an explosion before your research grant ranout you would have to find a way to detect any explosions within a distance of about one lightyear
2779,In fact bursts ofA Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
2780,html  of    AMgamma rays from space have been detected by satellites originally constructed to look for violations of the Test BanTreaty
2781,These seem to occur about sixteen times a month and to be roughly uniformly distributed in direction acrossthe sky
2782,This indicates that they come from outside the Solar System since otherwise we would expect them to beconcentrated toward the plane of the orbits of the planets
2783,The uniform distribution also indicates that the sources areeither fairly near to us in our galaxy or right outside it at cosmological distances because otherwise again they wouldbe concentrated toward the plane of the galaxy
2784,In the latter case the energy required to account for the bursts wouldbe far too high to have been produced by tiny black holes but if the sources were close in galactic terms it might bepossible that they were exploding black holes
2785,I would very much like this to be the case but I have to recognize thatthere are other possible explanations for the gamma ray bursts such as colliding neutron stars
2786,New observations inthe next few years particularly by gravitational wave detectors like LIGO should enable us to discover the origin of thegamma ray bursts
2787,Even if the search for primordial black holes proves negative as it seems it may it will still give us importantinformation about the very early stages of the universe
2788,If the early universe had been chaotic or irregular or if thepressure of matter had been low one would have expected it to produce many more primordial black holes than thelimit already set by our observations of the gamma ray background
2789,Only if the early universe was very smooth anduniform with a high pressure can one explain the absence of observable numbers of primordial black holes
2790,The idea of radiation from black holes was the first example of a prediction that depended in an essential way on boththe great theories of this century general relativity and quantum mechanics
2791,At the end of my talk the chairman of the session John G
2792,Thus even though we have not yet managed to find a primordial black hole there isfairly general agreement that if we did it would have to be emitting a lot of gamma rays and X rays
2793,The existence of radiation from black holes seems to imply that gravitational collapse is not as final and irreversible aswe once thought
2794,If an astronaut falls into a black hole its mass will increase but eventually the energy equivalent ofthat extra mass will be returned to the universe in the form of radiation
2795,The most likely outcome seems to be that the black hole will just disappear at least from our region of theuniverse taking with it the astronaut and any singularity there might be inside it if indeed there is one
2796,This was thefirst indication that quantum mechanics might remove the singularities that were predicted by general relativity
2797,From  onward I therefore started to develop a more powerfulapproach to quantum gravity based on Richard Feynrnans idea of a sum over histories
2798,The answers that thisapproach suggests for the origin and fate of the universe and its contents such as astronauts will be described in thenext two chapters
2799,We shall see that although the uncertainty principle places limitations on the accuracy of all ourpredictions it may at the same time remove the fundamental unpredictability that occurs at a spacetime singularity
2800,Any matter that fell into the hole would be destroyedat the singularity and only the gravitational effect of its mass would continue to be felt outside
2801,Now centuries later it had decided to invite anumber of experts to advise it on cosmology
2802,At the end of the conference the participants were granted an audiencewith the Pope
2803,He told us that it was all right to study the evolution of the universe after the big bang but we shouldnot inquire into the big bang itself because that was the moment of Creation and therefore the work of God
2804,This assumes that the universe is described by a Friedmann modelright back to the big bang
2805,In such models one finds that as the universe expands any matter or radiation in it getscooler
2806,Since temperature is simply a measure ofthe average energy  or speed  of the particles this cooling of the universe would have a major effect on the matterin it
2807,At very high temperatures particles would be moving around so fast that they could escape any attractiontoward each other due to nuclear or electromagnetic forces but as they cooled off one would expect particles thatattract each other to start to clump together
2808,Moreover even the types of particles that exist in the universe woulddepend on the temperature
2809,At the big bang itself the universe is thought to have had zero size and so to have been infinitely hot
2810,But as theuniverse expanded the temperature of the radiation decreased
2811,One second after the big bang it would have fallento about ten thousand million degrees
2812,This is about a thousand times the temperature at the center of the sun buttemperatures as high as this are reached in Hbomb explosions
2813,At this time the universe would have containedmostly photons electrons and neutrinos extremely light particles that are affected only by the weak force andgravity and their antiparticles together with some protons and neutrons
2814,So most of the electrons and antielectronswould have annihilated with each other to produce more photons leaving only a few electrons left over
2815,If we could observethem it would provide a good test of this picture of a very hot early stage of the universe
2816,Unfortunately theirenergies nowadays would be too low for us to observe them directly
2817,html  of    AMAbout one hundred seconds after the big bang the temperature would have fallen to one thousand million degreesthe temperature inside the hottest stars
2818,One can calculate thatin the hot big bang model about a quarter of the protons and neutrons would have been converted into helium nucleialong with a small amount of heavy hydrogen and other elements
2819,This picture of a hot early stage of the universe was first put forward by the scientist George Gamow in a famouspaper written in  with a student of his Ralph Alpher
2820,Gamow had quite a sense of humor  he persuaded thenuclear scientist Hans Bethe to add his name to the paper to make the list of authors Alpher Bethe Gamow likethe first three letters of the Greek alphabet alpha beta gamma particularly appropriate for a paper on the beginningof the universe In this paper they made the remarkable prediction that radiation in the form of photons from thevery hot early stages of the universe should still be around today but with its temperature reduced to only a fewdegrees above absolute zero C
2821,It was this radiation that Penzias and Wilson found in
2822,At the time thatAlpher Bethe and Gamow wrote their paper not much was known about the nuclear reactions of protons andneutrons
2823,We are therefore fairly confident that we have the right picture at least back to about one second after thebig bang
2824,Within only a few hours of the big bang the production of helium and other elements would have stopped
2825,And afterthat for the next million years or so the universe would have just continued expanding without anything muchhappening
2826,Eventually once the temperature had dropped to a few thousand degrees and electrons and nuclei nolonger had enough energy to overcome the electromagnetic attraction between them they would have startedcombining to form atoms
2827,This would eventually stop expansion in some regions and cause them to start to recollapse
2828,As they werecollapsing the gravitational pull of matter outside these regions might start them rotating slightly
2829,As the collapsingregion got smaller it would spin faster  just as skaters spinning on ice spin faster as they draw in their arms
2830,In these the region would stop collapsing because individualparts of the galaxy would be orbiting stably round its center but the galaxy would have no overall rotation
2831,As time went on the hydrogen and helium gas in the galaxies would break up into smaller clouds that would collapseunder their own gravity
2832,As these contracted and the atoms within them collided with one another the temperatureof the gas would increase until eventually it became hot enough to start nuclear fusion reactions
2833,These wouldconvert the hydrogen into more helium and the heat given off would raise the pressure and so stop the clouds fromcontracting any further
2834,They would remain stable in this state for a long time as stars like our sun burning hydrogeninto helium and radiating the resulting energy as heat and light
2835,More massive stars would need to be hotter tobalance their stronger gravitational attraction making the nuclear fusion reactions proceed so much more rapidly thatthey would use up their hydrogen in as little as a hundred million years
2836,They would then contract slightly and asthey heated up further would start to convert helium into heavier elements like carbon or oxygen
2837,Some of the heavierelements produced near the end of the stars life would be flung back into the gas in the galaxy and would providesome of the raw material for the next generation of stars
2838,Our own sun contains about  percent of these heavierelements because it is a second or thirdgeneration star formed some five thousand million years ago out of acloud of rotating gas containing the debris of earlier supernovas
2839,Most of the gas in that cloud went to form the sun orgot blown away but a small amount of the heavier elements collected together to form the bodies that now orbit thesun as planets like the earth
2840,The earth was initially very hot and without an atmosphere
2841,In the course of time it cooled and acquired anA Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
2842,html  of    AMatmosphere from the emission of gases from the rocks
2843,It contained no oxygen but a lot of other gases that are poisonous to us such as hydrogen sulfide the gasthat gives rotten eggs their smell
2844,Mostly these errors would have been such that the new macromolecule could not reproduce itself andeventually would have been destroyed
2845,They would have therefore had an advantage and would have tendedto replace the original macromolecules
2846,In this way a process of evolution was started that led to the development ofmore and more complicated selfreproducing organisms
2847,The first primitive forms of life consumed various materialsincluding hydrogen sulfide and released oxygen
2848,This gradually changed the atmosphere to the composition that ithas today and allowed the development of higher forms of life such as fish reptiles mammals and ultimately thehuman race
2849,This picture of a universe that started off very hot and cooled as it expanded is in agreement with all theobservational evidence that we have today
2850,If they all give exactly thesame answer you can be pretty sure they have communicated with each other
2851,Yet in the model described abovethere would not have been time since the big bang for light to get from one distant region to another even though theregions were close together in the early universe
2852,According to the theory of relativity if light cannot get from oneregion to another no other information can
2853,Despite the fact that the universe is so uniform and homogeneous on a large scale it contains local irregularitiessuch as stars and galaxies
2854,These are thought to have developed from small differences in the density of the earlyuniverse from one region to another
2855,Spacetime w ould have a boundary  a beginning at the big bang
2856,These laws may have originally been decreed byGod but it appears that he has since left the universe to evolve according to them and does not now intervene in it
2857,It would be only natural tosuppose that this order should apply not only to the laws but also to the conditions at the boundary of spacetimethat specify the initial state of the universe
2858,There may be a large number of models of the universe with differentinitial conditions that all obey the laws
2859,There ought to be some principle that picks out one initial state and henceA Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
2860,These implicitly assume either that the universeis spatially infinite or that there are infinitely many universes
2861,Under chaotic boundary conditions the probability offinding any particular region of space in any given configuration just after the big bang is the same in some senseas the probability of finding it in any other configuration the initial state of the universe is chosen purely randomly
2862,This would mean that the early universe would have probably been very chaotic and irregular because there aremany more chaotic and disordered configurations for the universe than there are smooth and ordered ones
2863,If eachconfiguration is equally probable it is likely that the universe started out in a chaotic and disordered state simplybecause there are so many more of them
2864,One would also have expected thedensity fluctuations in such a model to have led to the formation of many more primordial black holes than the upperlimit that has been set by observations of the gamma ray background
2865,Similarly in the case of the universe could it be that we are living in aregion that just happens by chance to be smooth and uniform At first sight this might seem very improbablebecause such smooth regions would be heavily outnumbered by chaotic and irregular regions
2866,There are two versions of the anthropic principle the weak and the strong
2867,The weak anthropic principle states thatin a universe that is large or infinite in space andor time the conditions necessary for the development of intelligentlife will be met only in certain regions that are limited in space and time
2868,The intelligent beings in these regionsshould therefore not be surprised if they observe that their locality in the universe satisfies the conditions that arenecessary for their existence
2869,It is a bit like a rich person living in a wealthy neighborhood not seeing any poverty
2870,As explained above an early generation ofstars first had to form
2871,The first one ortwo thousand million years of the earths existence were too hot for the development of anything complicated
2872,Few people would quarrel with the validity or utility of the weak anthropic principle
2873,According to this theory there are either many different universes ormany different regions of a single universe each with its own initial configuration and perhaps with its own set oflaws of science
2874,We cannot at the moment at leastpredict the values of these numbers from theory  we have to find them by observation
2875,It may be that one day weshall discover a complete unified theory that predicts them all but it is also possible that some or all of them varyfrom universe to universe or within a single universe
2876,The remarkable fact is that the values of these numbers seemto have been very finely adjusted to make possible the development of life
2877,For example if the electric charge of theelectron had been only slightly different stars either would have been unable to burn hydrogen and helium or elsethey would not have exploded
2878,Nevertheless it seems clear that there arerelatively few ranges of values for the numbers that would allow the development of any form of intelligent life
2879,Mostsets of values would give rise to universes that although they might be very beautiful would contain no one able towonder at that beauty
2880,One can take this either as evidence of a divine purpose in Creation and the choice of theA Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
2881,html  of    AMlaws of science or as support for the strong anthropic principle
2882,There are a number of objections that one can raise to the strong anthropic principle as an explanation of theobserved state of the universe
2883,We should therefore use the principle of economy and cut them out of the theory
2884,If on the otherhand they are just different regions of a single universe the laws of science would have to be the same in eachregion because otherwise one could not move continuously from one region to another
2885,In this case the onlydifference between the regions would be their initial configurations and so the strong anthropic principle wouldreduce to the weak one
2886,But there does not seem to be any need for all those other galaxies nor for the universe to be souniform and similar in every direction on the large scale
2887,If this is the case a universe that developed from some sort of random initial conditions should contain anumber of regions that are smooth and uniform and are suitable for the evolution of intelligent life
2888,In the hot big bang modeldescribed above there was not enough time in the early universe for heat to have flowed from one region to another
2889,The initial rate of expansion also would have had to be chosen very precisely for the rate of expansion still to be soclose to the critical rate needed to avoid recollapse
2890,This means that the initial state of the universe must have beenvery carefully chosen indeed if the hot big bang model was correct right back to the beginning of time
2891,This expansion is said to beinflationary meaning that the universe at one time expanded at an increasing rate rather than the decreasing ratethat it does today
2892,According to Guth the radius of the universe increased by a million million million million million with thirty zeros after it times in only a tiny fraction of a second
2893,Guth suggested that the universe started out from the big bang in a very hot but rather chaotic state
2894,These hightemperatures would have meant that the particles in the universe would be moving very fast and would have highenergies
2895,As we discussed earlier one would expect that at such high temperatures the strong and weak nuclearforces and the electromagnetic force would all be unified into a single force
2896,As the universe expanded it would cooland particle energies would go down
2897,Liquid water issymmetrical the same at every point and in every direction
2898,In the case of water if one is careful one can supercool it that is one can reduce the temperature below thefreezing point OC without ice forming
2899,Guth suggested that the universe might behave in a similar way thetemperature might drop below the critical value without the symmetry between the forces being broken
2900,If thishappened the universe would be in an unstable state with more energy than if the symmetry had been broken
2901,Since the universe would already be expanding just as in the hot big bang model the repulsive effect ofA Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
2902,html  of    AMthis cosmological constant would therefore have made the universe expand at an everincreasing rate
2903,Thus these regions would also expand inan accelerating inflationary manner
2904,As they expanded and the matter particles got farther apart one would be leftwith an expanding universe that contained hardly any particles and was still in the supercooled state
2905,Thus the present smooth and uniform state of the universe could have evolvedfrom many different nonuniform initial states
2906,Moreover the rate of expansion of the universe would automatically becomevery close to the critical rate determined by the energy density of the universe
2907,There are something like tenmillion million million million million million million million million million million million million million  with eightyzeros after it particles in the region of the universe that we can observe
2908,The answer is that the total energy of the universe is exactlyzero
2909,The matter in the universe is made out of positive energy
2910,Two pieces of matter that are close to each other have less energy than the same two pieces a long way apartbecause you have to expend energy to separate them against the gravitational force that is pulling them together
2911,Thus in a sense the gravitational field has negative energy
2912,Thus the universe can double the amount of positive matter energy and also double thenegative gravitational energy without violation of the conservation of energy
2913,During the inflationary phase the universe increases its sizeby a very large amount
2914,Thus the total amount of energy available to make particles becomes very large
2915,As Guthhas remarked It is said that theres no such thing as a free lunch
2916,The universe is not expanding in an inflationary way today
2917,Thus there has to be some mechanism that wouldeliminate the very large effective cosmological constant and so change the rate of expansion from an acceleratedone to one that is slowed down by gravity as we have today
2918,In the inflationary expansion one might expect thateventually the symmetry between the forces would be broken just as supercooled water always freezes in the end
2919,The extra energy of the unbroken symmetry state would then be released and would reheat the universe to atemperature just below the critical temperature for symmetry between the forces
2920,In Guths original proposal the phase transition was supposed to occur suddenly rather like the appearance of icecrystals in very cold water
2921,The idea was that bubbles of the new phase of broken symmetry would have formed inthe old phase like bubbles of steam surrounded by boiling water
2922,The trouble was as I and several other peoplepointed out that the universe was expanding so fast that even if the bubbles grew at the speed of light they wouldbe moving away from each other and so could not join up
2923,The universe would be left in a very nonuniform statewith some regions still having symmetry between the different forces
2924,In October  I went to Moscow for a conference on quantum gravity
2925,After the conference I gave a seminar onthe inflationary model and its problems at the Sternberg Astronomical Institute
2926,Before this I had got someone elseto give my lectures for me because most people could not understand my voice
2927,But there was not time to preparethis seminar so I gave it myself with one of my graduate students repeating my words
2928,It worked well and gave meA Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
2929,In the audience was a young Russian Andrei Linde from the LebedevInstitute in Moscow
2930,He said that the difficulty with the bubbles not joining up could be avoided if the bubbles were sobig that our region of the universe is all contained inside a single bubble
2931,In order for this to work the change fromsymmetry to broken symmetry must have taken place very slowly inside the bubble but this is quite possibleaccording to grand unified theories
2932,I was very excited by this idea and discussed it with one of my students Ian Moss
2933,I replied that there was this flaw about the bubbles being bigger thanthe universe but that the basic idea of a slow breaking of symmetry was very good
2934,My secretary Judy Fella had used her not inconsiderable charm to persuade British Airways togive herself and me free seats on a Concorde as a publicity venture
2935,was held up on my way to theairport by heavy rain and I missed the plane
2936,Nevertheless I got to Philadelphia in the end and received my medal
2937,Iwas then asked to give a seminar on the inflationary universe at Drexel University in Philadelphia
2938,I gave the sameseminar about the problems of the inflationary universe just as in Moscow
2939,A very similar idea to Lindes was put forth independently a few months later by Paul Steinhardt and AndreasAlbrecht of the University of Pennsylvania
2940,The old inflationary model was Guthsoriginal suggestion of fast symmetry breaking with the formation of bubbles
2941,Later work has also cast doubt on whether there could be aphase transition in the very early universe of the kind required
2942,In my personal opinion the new inflationary model isnow dead as a scientific theory although a lot of people do not seem to have heard of its demise and are still writingpapers as if it were viable
2943,A better model called the chaotic inflationary model was put forward by Linde in
2944,The energy of the field in those regionswould behave like a cosmological constant
2945,It would have a repulsive gravitational effect and thus make thoseregions expand in an inflationary manner
2946,As they expanded the energy of the field in them would slowly decreaseuntil the inflationary expansion changed to an expansion like that in the hot big bang model
2947,This model has all the advantages of the earlierinflationary models but it does not depend on a dubious phase transition and it can moreover give a reasonable sizefor the fluctuations in the temperature of the microwave background that agrees with observation
2948,One could use the laws ofscience to evolve the universe back in time to determine its configuration at earlier times
2949,According to the singularitytheorems of classical general relativity there would still have been a big bang singularity
2950,If you evolve such auniverse forward in time according to the laws of science you will end up with the lumpy and irregular state youstarted with
2951,Thus there must have been initial configurations that would not have given rise to a universe like theone we see today
2952,Must we turn to the anthropic principle for an explanationWas it all just a lucky chance That would seem a counsel of despair a negation of all our hopes of understandingthe underlying order of the universe
2953,html  of    AMthe beginning of time would have been a point of infinite density and infinite curvature of spacetime
2954,All the knownlaws of science would break down at such a point
2955,So one has to use a quantum theory of gravity todiscuss the very early stages of the universe
2956,We dont yet have a complete and consistent theory that combines quantum mechanics and gravity
2957,One is that it should incorporateFeynmans proposal to formulate quantum theory in terms of a sum over histories
2958,In this approach a particle doesnot have just a single history as it would in a classical theory
2959,Instead it is supposed to follow every possible path inspacetime and with each of these histories there are associated a couple of numbers one representing the size ofa wave and the other representing its position in the cycle its phase
2960,The probability that the particle say passesthrough some particular point is found by adding up the waves associated with every possible history that passesthrough that point
2961,Imaginary time may sound like science fiction but it is in fact a welldefined mathematical concept
2962,If we take anyordinary or real number and multiply it by itself the result is a positive number
2963,One can picture real and imaginary numbers in the following way The real numbers can be represented by a linegoing from left to right with zero in the middle negative numbers like     etc
2964,Then imaginary numbers are represented by a line going up and down the page with i i etc
2965,Thus imaginary numbers are in a sense numbers at right angles toordinary real numbers
2966,To avoid the technical difficulties with Feynmans sum over histories one must use imaginary time
2967,That is to say forthe purposes of the calculation one must measure time using imaginary numbers rather than real ones
2968,This has aninteresting effect on spacetime the distinction between time and space disappears completely
2969,In Euclidean spacetime there is no difference between thetime direction and directions in space
2970,In any case as far as everyday quantum mechanics is concerned we mayregard our use of imaginary time and Euclidean spacetime as merely a mathematical device or trick to calculateanswers about real spacetime
2971,A second feature that we believe must be part of any ultimate theory is Einsteins idea that the gravitational field isrepresented by curved spacetime particles try to follow the nearest thing to a straight path in a curved space butbecause spacetime is not flat their paths appear to be bent as if by a gravitational field
2972,To avoid the technical difficulties in actually performingthe sum over histories these curved spacetimes must be taken to be Euclidean
2973,That is time is imaginary and isindistinguishable from directions in space
2974,To calculate the probability of finding a real spacetime with some certainproperty such as looking the same at every point and in every direction one adds up the waves associated with allthe histories that have that property
2975,In the classical theory of general relativity there are many different possible curved spacetimes each correspondingto a different initial state of the universe
2976,If we knew the initial state of our universe we would know its entire history
2977,Similarly in the quantum theory of gravity there are many different possible quantum states for the universe
2978,In the quantum theory of gravity on the other hand a third possibility arises
2979,Spacetime wouldbe like the surface of the earth only with two more dimensions
2980,The surface of the earth is finite in extent but itdoesnt have a boundary or edge if you sail off into the sunset you dont fall off the edge or run into a singularity
2981,One could say The boundary condition ofthe universe is that it has no boundary
2982,The universe would be completely selfcontained and not affected byanything outside itself
2983,It would neither be created nor destroyed It would just BE
2984,It was at the conference in the Vatican mentioned earlier that I first put forward the suggestion that maybe time andspace together formed a surface that was finite in size but did not have any boundary or edge
2985,Id like to emphasize that this idea that time and space should be finite without boundary is just a proposal it cannot be deduced from some other principle
2986,Like any other scientific theory it may initially be put forward for aesthetic ormetaphysical reasons but the real test is whether it makes predictions that agree with observation
2987,One therefore has tomake simplifying assumptions and approximations  and even then the problem of extracting predictions remains aformidable one
2988,To do this we must perform thesum over histories for all possible Euclidean spacetimes that have no boundary
2989,Under the no boundary proposal one learns that the chance of the universe being found to be following most of thepossible histories is negligible but there is a particular family of histories that are much more probable than theothers
2990,These histories may be pictured as being like the surface of the earth with the distance from the North Polerepresenting imaginary time and the size of a circle of constant distance from the North Pole representing the spatialsize of the universe
2991,The universe starts at the North Pole as a single point
2992,As one moves south the circles oflatitude at constant distance from the North Pole get bigger corresponding to the universe expanding with imaginarytime Figure
2993,The universe would reach a maximum size at the equator and would contract with increasing imaginary time to a single point at the South Pole
2994,Ever though the universe would have zero size at the North andSouth Poles these points would not be singularities any more than the North aid South Poles on the earth aresingular
2995,The laws of science will hold at them just as they do at the North and South Poles on the earth
2996,Thus in a sense we are still all doomed even if we keep away from black holes
2997,Only if we could picture the universe interms of imaginary time would there be no singularities
2998,If the universe really is in such a quantum state there would be no singularities in the history of the universe inimaginary time
2999,It might seem therefore that my more recent work had completely undone the results of my earlierwork on singularities
3000,This in turnled to the idea that the universe could be finite in imaginary time but without boundaries or singularities
3001,But according to the approach Idescribed in Chapter  a scientific theory is just a mathematical model we make to describe our observations itexists only in our minds
3002,In thesimplified models that have been examined so far this probability turns out to be high that is the proposed noboundary condition leads to the prediction that it is extremely probable that the present rate of expansion of theuniverse is almost the same in each direction
3003,If the universe were expandingfaster in some directions than in others the intensity of the radiation in those directions would be reduced by anA Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
3004,Further predictions of the no boundary condition are currently being worked out
3005,A particularly interesting problem isthe size of the small departures from uniform density in the early universe that caused the formation first of thegalaxies then of stars and finally of us
3006,The uncertainty principle implies that the early universe cannot have beencompletely uniform because there must have been some uncertainties or fluctuations in the positions and velocitiesof the particles
3007,Using the no boundary condition we find that the universe must in fact have started off with just theminimum possible nonuniformity allowed by the uncertainty principle
3008,The universe would have then undergone aperiod of rapid expansion as in the inflationary models
3009,During this period the initial nonuniformities would havebeen amplified until they were big enough to explain the origin of the structures we observe around us
3010,In  theCosmic Background Explorer satellite COBE first detected very slight variations in the intensity of the microwavebackground with direction
3011,The way these nonuniformities depend on direction seems to agree with the predictionsof the inflationary model and the no boundary proposal
3012,Thus the no boundary proposal is a good scientific theory inthe sense of Karl Popper it could have been falsified by observations but instead its predictions have beenconfirmed
3013,This would lead to the formationof galaxies stars and eventually even insignificant creatures like ourselves
3014,Thus all the complicated structures thatwe see in the universe might be explained by the no boundary condition for the universe together with the uncertaintyprinciple of quantum mechanics
3015,The idea that space and time may form a closed surface without boundary also has profound implications for the roleof God in the affairs of the universe
3016,With the success of scientific theories in describing events most people havecome to believe that God allows the universe to evolve according to a set of laws and does not intervene in theuniverse to break these laws
3017,So long as the universehad a beginning we could suppose it had a creator
3018,But if the universe is really completely selfcontained having noboundary or edge it would have neither beginning nor end it would simply be
3019,Up to thebeginning of this century people believed in an absolute time
3020,That is each event could be labeled by a numbercalled time in a unique way and all good clocks would agree on the time interval between two events
3021,Instead each observer would have his own measure of time as recorded by a clock that hecarried clocks carried by different observers would not necessarily agree
3022,If one can go north one can turn around and headsouth equally if one can go forward in imaginary time one ought to be able to turn round and go backward
3023,This means that there can be no important difference between the forward and backward directions ofimaginary time
3024,More precisely as explained earlierthe laws of science are unchanged under the combination of operations or symmetries known as C P and T
3025,P means taking the mirror image so left and right are interchanged
3026,And T means reversing the direction of motion of all particles in effect running the motion backward
3027,The laws of science that govern the behavior of matter under all normal situations are unchangedunder the combination of the two operations C and P on their own
3028,If the laws of science are unchanged by the combination of operations C and P and also by the combination CP and T they must also be unchanged under the operation T alone
3029,Yet there is a big difference between theforward and backward directions of real time in ordinary life
3030,Imagine a cup of water falling off a table andbreaking into pieces on the floor
3031,If you take a film of this you can easily tell whether it is being run forward orbackward
3032,You can tell that the film is being run backward because this kindof behavior is never observed in ordinary life
3033,If it were crockery manufacturers would go out of business
3034,This says thatin any closed system disorder or entropy always increases with time
3035,In other words it is a form of Murphyslaw things always tend to go wrong An intact cup on the table is a state of high order but a broken cup on thefloor is a disordered state
3036,One can go readily from the cup on the table in the past to the broken cup on thefloor in the future but not the other way round
3037,I shall argue that the psychological arrow is determined by the thermodynamic arrowA Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
3038,html  of    AMand that these two arrows necessarily always point in the same direction
3039,The second law of thermodynamics results from the factthat there are always many more disordered states than there are ordered ones
3040,For example consider thepieces of a jigsaw in a box
3041,Suppose a system starts out in one of the small number of ordered states
3042,As time goes by the system willevolve according to the laws of science and its state will change
3043,At a later time it is more probable that thesystem will be in a disordered state than in an ordered one because there are more disordered states
3044,Thusdisorder will tend to increase with time if the system obeys an initial condition of high order
3045,Ifyou shake the box the pieces will take up another arrangement
3046,So the disorder of the pieces will probably increase with time ifthe pieces obey the initial condition that they start off in a condition of high order
3047,At early times the universe would probably be in a disordered state
3048,You would see broken cups gathering themselves together and jumping back onto the table
3049,I shall argue that such beings would have a psychologicalarrow of time that was backward
3050,That is they would remember events in the future and not remember eventsin their past
3051,I shall therefore discuss the psychological arrow oftime for computers
3052,I think it is reasonable to assume that the arrow for computers is the same as that forhumans
3053,If it were not one could make a killing on the stock exchange by having a computer that wouldremember tomorrows prices A computer memory is basically a device containing elements that can exist ineither of two states
3054,In its simplest form this consists of a number of wires oneach wire there are a number of beads that can be put in one of two positions
3055,Before an item is recorded in acomputers memory the memory is in a disordered state with equal probabilities for the two possible states
3056,The abacus beads are scattered randomly on the wires of the abacus
3057,After the memory interacts with thesystem to be remembered it will definitely be in one state or the other according to the state of the system
3058,Each abacus bead will be at either the left or the right of the abacus wire
3059,So the memory has passed from adisordered state to an ordered one
3060,Thisenergy is dissipated as heat and increases the amount of disorder in the universe
3061,Our subjective sense of the direction of time the psychological arrow of time is therefore determined within ourbrain by the thermodynamic arrow of time
3062,Disorder increases with timeA Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
3063,The universe could havestarted out in a very smooth and ordered state
3064,This would have led to welldefined thermodynamic andcosmological arrows of time as we observe
3065,But it could equally well have started out in a very lumpy anddisordered state
3066,In that case the universe would already be in a state of complete disorder so disorder couldnot increase with time
3067,In that case the beginning of time would be a regular smooth point of spacetime and theuniverse would have begun its expansion in a very smooth and ordered state
3068,It could not have beencompletely uniform because that would violate the uncertainty principle of quantum theory
3069,There had to besmall fluctuations in the density and velocities of particles
3070,During this expansion the density fluctuations would haveremained small at first but later would have started to grow
3071,Eventually such regions would stop expanding and collapse to form galaxies stars and beings like us
3072,Theuniverse would have started in a smooth and ordered state and would become lumpy and disordered as timewent on
3073,This would explain the existence of the thermodynamic arrow of time
3074,So if disorder were to decrease in the contracting phase of the universe one might also expect it todecrease inside a black hole
3075,Nor would he be able to let us know about the reversal ofthe thermodynamic arrow or even bank his winnings because he would be trapped behind the event horizonof the black hole
3076,This would mean thatthe contracting phase would be like the time reverse of the expanding phase
3077,People in the contracting phasewould live their lives backward they would die before they were born and get younger as the universeA Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
3078,This idea is attractive because it would mean a nice symmetry between the expanding and contracting phases
3079,The question is is itimplied by the no boundary condition or is it inconsistent with that condition As I said I thought at first that theno boundary condition did indeed imply that disorder would decrease in the contracting phase
3080,I was misledpartly by the analogy with the surface of the earth
3081,If one took the beginning of the universe to correspond tothe North Pole then the end of the universe should be similar to the beginning just as the South Pole is similarto the North
3082,The beginning and end in real time can be very different from each other
3083,Further one of my students Raymond Laflamme found that in a slightly more complicated model thecollapse of the universe was very different from the expansion
3084,I realized that I had made a mistake the noboundary condition implied that disorder would in fact continue to increase during the contraction
3085,It seems to me much better and lessconfusing if you admit in print that you were wrong
3086,One can answer this on the basis of the weak anthropic principle
3087,By then allthe stars will have burned out and the protons and neutrons in them will probably have decayed into lightparticles and radiation
3088,The universe would be in a state of almost complete disorder
3089,Disorder couldnt increase much because the universe would be in a state ofalmost complete disorder already
3090,Thus intelligent life could not exist in the contractingphase of the universe
3091,It is not that the expansion of the universe causes disorder toincrease
3092,Rather it is that the no boundary condition causes disorder to increase and the conditions to besuitable for intelligent life only in the expanding phase
3093,To summarize the laws of science do not distinguish between the forward and backward directions of time
3094,The no boundaryproposal for the universe predicts the existence of a welldefined thermodynamic arrow of time because theuniverse must start off in a smooth and ordered state
3095,And the reason we observe this thermodynamic arrow toA Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
3096,html  of    AMagree with the cosmological arrow is that intelligent beings can exist only in the expanding phase
3097,Thecontracting phase will be unsuitable because it has no strong thermodynamic arrow of time
3098,The progress of the human race in understanding the universe has established a small corner of order in anincreasingly disordered universe
3099,If you remember every word in this book your memory will have recordedabout two million pieces of information the order in your brain will have increased by about two million units
3100,This will increase the disorder of the universe by about twenty million millionmillion million units  or about ten million million million times the increase in order in your brain  and thats ifyou remember everything in this book
3101,Wells in The Time Machine explored these possibilities as have countless other writers of science fiction
3102,Yet many of the ideas of science fiction like submarines and travel to the moon have become matters ofscience fact
3103,Like the uncertainty principle Godelsincompleteness theorem may be a fundamental limitation on our ability to understand and predict the universebut so far at least it hasnt seemed to be an obstacle in our search for a complete unified theory
3104,This had the side effect that it would be possible for someone to go off in a rocket ship and return to earthbefore he set out
3105,After Hubblediscovered the expansion of the universe there was no need for a cosmological constant and it is nowgenerally believed to be zero
3106,Another is a spacetime that contains two cosmic strings moving past each other at high speed
3107,As theirname suggests cosmic strings are objects that are like string in that they have length but a tiny cross section
3108,Actually they are more like rubber bands because they are under enormous tension something like a millionmillion million million tons
3109,A cosmic string attached to the earth could accelerate it from  to  mph in thof a second
3110,Cosmic strings may sound like pure science fiction but there are reasons to believe they couldhave formed in the early universe as a result of symmetrybreaking of the kind discussed in Chapter
3111,The Godel solution and the cosmic string spacetime start out so distorted that travel into the past was alwayspossible
3112,God might have created such a warped universe but we have no reason to believe he did
3113,Observations of the microwave background and of the abundances of the light elements indicate that the earlyuniverse did not have the kind of curvature required to allow time travel
3114,The same conclusion follows ontheoretical grounds if the no boundary proposal is correct
3115,So the question is if the universe starts out withoutthe kind of curvature required for time travel can we subsequently warp local regions of spacetime sufficientlyto allow itA closely related problem that is also of concern to writers of science fiction is rapid interstellar or intergalacticA Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
3116,If the expedition were to the center ofour galaxy it would be at least a hundred thousand years before it came back
3117,But there would not be much joy in returning from a space voyage a fewyears older to find that everyone you had left behind was dead and gone thousands of years ago
3118,She departed one dayIn a relative wayAnd arrived on the previous nightThe point is that the theory of relativity says hat there is no unique measure of time that all observers will agreeon Rather each observer has his or her own measure of time
3119,If it is possible for a rocket traveling below thespeed of light to get from event A say the final of the meter race of the Olympic Games in  to event Bsay the opening of the th meeting of the Congress of Alpha Centauri then all observers will agreethat event A happened before event B according to their times
3120,Then observers moving atdifferent speeds can disagree about whether event A occurred before B or vice versa
3121,Thusthis observer would think that a spaceship could get from A to B in time if only it could ignore the speedoflightspeed limit
3122,The theory of relativity says that the laws of physics appear the same to observers moving at different speeds
3123,This has been well tested by experiment and is likely to remain a feature even if we find a more advancedtheory to replace relativity Thus the moving observer would say that if fasterthanlight travel is possible itshould be possible to get from event B the opening of the Congress to event A the meter race
3124,If onewent slightly faster one could even get back before the race and place a bet on it in the sure knowledge thatone would win
3125,The theory of relativity says that the rocket powerneeded to accelerate a spaceship gets greater and greater the nearer it gets to the speed of light
3126,We haveexperimental evidence for this not with spaceships but with elementary particles in particle accelerators likethose at Fermilab or CERN European Centre for Nuclear Research
3127,That might seem to rule out both rapid space travel and travel back in time
3128,It might be that one could warp spacetime so that there was a shortcut between A and B One way of doingthis would be to create a wormhole between A and B
3129,There need be no relation between the distance through the wormhole and the separation of its ends in thenearly Hat background
3130,Thus one could imagine that one could create or find a wormhole that world lead fromthe vicinity of the Solar System to Alpha Centauri
3131,The distance through the wormhole might be only a fewmillion miles even though earth and Alpha Centauri are twenty million million miles apart in ordinary space
3132,Thiswould allow news of the meter race to reach the opening of the Congress
3133,But then an observer movingtoward e earth should also be able to find another wormhole that would enable him to get from the opening ofA Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
3134,html  of    AMthe Congress on Alpha Centauri back to earth before the start of the race
3135,So wormholes like any otherpossible form of travel faster than light would allow one to travel into the past
3136,The idea of wormholes between different regions of spacetime was not an invention of science fiction writersbut came from a very respectable source
3137,The EinsteinRosen bridges didnt last longenough for a spaceship to get through the ship would run into a singularity as the wormhole pinched off
3138,Energy is a bit like money if you have a positive balance you can distribute it in various ways but according tothe classical laws that were believed at the beginning of the century you werent allowed to be overdrawn
3139,Sothese classical laws would have ruled out any possibility of time travel
3140,Thequantum laws are more liberal and allow you to be overdrawn on one or two accounts provided the totalbalance is positive
3141,In other words quantum theory allows the energy density to be negative in some placesprovided that this is made up for by positive energy densities in other places so that the total energy remainspositive
3142,Now suppose one has two parallel metal plates a short distance apart
3143,The plates will act like mirrors for thevirtual photons or particles of light
3144,In fact they will form a cavity between them a bit like an organ pipe that willresonate only at certain notes
3145,Thus therewill be slightly fewer virtual photons hitting the inside surfaces of the plates than the outside surfaces
3146,Onewould therefore expect a force on the plates pushing them toward each other
3147,This force has actually beendetected and has the predicted value
3148,Thus we have experimental evidence that virtual particles exist and havereal effects
3149,But the total energy density in empty space far away from the plates must be zero becauseotherwise the energy density would warp the space and it would not be almost flat
3150,So if the energy densitybetween the plates is less than the energy density far away it must be negative
3151,We thus have experimental evidence both that spacetime can be warped from the bending of light duringeclipses and that it can be curved in the way necessary to allow time travel from the Casimir effect
3152,Onemight hope therefore that as we advance in science and technology we would eventually manage to build atime machine
3153,Of course some people would claim that sightings of UFOs are evidence thatwe are being visited either by aliens or by people from the future
3154,If the aliens were to get here in reasonabletime they would need fasterthanlight travel so the two possibilities may be equivalent
3155,html  of    AMregarded as reliable witnesses If they are trying to warn us of some great danger they are not being veryeffective
3156,A possible way to explain the absence of visitors from the future would be to say that the past is fixed becausewe have observed it and seen that it does not have the kind of warping needed to allow travel back from thefuture
3157,On the other hand the future is unknown and open so it might well have the curvature required
3158,Thiswould mean that any time travel would be confined to the future
3159,There would be no chance of Captain Kirk andthe Starship Enterprise turning up at the present time
3160,Suppose for example you wentback and killed your greatgreatgrandfather while he was still a child
3161,There are many versions of this paradoxbut they are essentially equivalent one would get contradictions if one were free to change the past
3162,There seem to be two possible resolutions to the paradoxes posed by time travel
3163,Of course one could say that free will is anillusion anyway
3164,If there really is a complete unified theory that governs everything it presumably alsodetermines your actions
3165,But it does so in a way that is impossible to calculate for an organism that is ascomplicated as a human being
3166,Thus in that situation the time traveler would have no free will
3167,The other possible way to resolve the paradoxes of time travel might be called the alternative historieshypothesis
3168,Thus they can act freely without the constraint of consistency with their previoushistory
3169,Steven Spielberg had fun with this notion in the Back to the Future films Marty McFly was able to go back and change his parents courtship to a more satisfactory history
3170,This said that the universe didnt just have asingle history rather it had every possible history each with its own probability
3171,In Feynmans sum each historycomprises a complete spacetime and everything in it
3172,The spacetime may be so warped that it is possible totravel in a rocket into the past
3173,Thus Feynmans sum over histories proposal seems to support theconsistent histories hypothesis rather than the alternative histories
3174,The Feynman sum over histories does allow travel into the past on a microscopic scale
3175,In Chapter  we saw that the laws of science are unchanged by combinations of the operations C P and T
3176,This means that anantiparticle spinning in the anticlockwise direction and moving from A to B can also be viewed as an ordinaryparticle spinning clockwise and moving backward in time from B to A
3177,Similarly an ordinary particle movingforward in time is equivalent to an antiparticle moving backward in time
3178,As has been discussed in this chapterand Chapter  empty space is filled with pairs of virtual particles and antiparticles that appear together moveapart and then come back together and annihilate each other
3179,So one can regard the pair of particles as a single particle moving on a closed loop in spacetime
3180,The forsaken particle might fall into the hole as well but itmight also escape from the vicinity of the black hole
3181,If so to an observer at a distance it would appear to be aparticle emitted by the black hole
3182,One can regard the member of the virtual pair that fell into the black hole say the antiparticle as aparticle traveling backward in time out of the hole
3183,If instead it were the particle member of the virtual pair thatfell into the hole one could regard it as an antiparticle traveling back in time and coming out of the black hole
3184,The Feynman sum over histories proposal is supposed to be over all histories
3185,This says that thelaws of physics conspire to prevent macroscopic bodies from carrying information into the past
3186,Like the cosmic censorship conjecture it has not been proved but there are reasons to believe it is true
3187,As these particles can go round the loop any number oftimes they pass each point on their route many times
3188,Thus their energy is counted over and over again andthe energy density will become very large
3189,This could give spacetime a positive curvature that would not allowtravel into the past
3190,It is not yet clear whether these particles would cause positive or negative curvature orwhether the curvature produced by some kinds of virtual particles might cancel that produced by other kinds
3191,My opponent might have theunfair advantage of knowing the future
3192,html  of    AMCHAPTER  THE UNIFICATION OF PHYSICS   As was explained in the first chapter it would be very difficult to construct a complete unified theory ofeverything in the universe all at one go
3193,So instead we have made progress by finding partial theories thatdescribe a limited range of happenings and by neglecting other effects or approximating them by certainnumbers
3194,Chemistry for example allows us to calculate the interactions of atoms without knowing the internalstructure of an atoms nucleus
3195,The quest for such a theory is knownas the unification of physics
3196,Einstein spent most of his later years unsuccessfully searching for a unifiedtheory but the time was not ripe there were partial theories for gravity and the electromagnetic force but verylittle was known about the nuclear forces
3197,Moreover Einstein refused to believe in the reality of quantummechanics despite the important role he had played in its development
3198,Yet it seems that the uncertaintyprinciple is a fundamental feature of the universe we live in
3199,As I shall describe the prospects for finding such a theory seem to be much better now because we know somuch more about the universe
3200,But we must beware of overconfidence  we have had false dawns before Atthe beginning of this century for example it was thought that everything could be explained in terms of theproperties of continuous matter such as elasticity and heat conduction
3201,The discovery of atomic structure andthe uncertainty principle put an emphatic end to that
3202,Then again in  physicist and Nobel Prize winnerMax Born told a group of visitors to Gottingen University Physics as we know it will be over in six months
3203,His confidence was based on the recent discovery by Dirac of the equation that governed the electron
3204,Having said this I still believe there are grounds for cautious optimism thatwe may now be near the end of the search for the ultimate laws of nature
3205,In previous chapters I have described general relativity the partial theory of gravity and the partial theories thatgovern the weak the strong and the electromagnetic forces
3206,The main difficulty in finding a theory thatunifies gravity with the other forces is that general relativity is a classical theory that is it does not incorporatethe uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics
3207,On the other hand the other partial theories depend onquantum mechanics in an essential way
3208,A necessary first step therefore is to combine general relativity withthe uncertainty principle
3209,As we have seen this can produce some remarkable consequences such as blackholes not being black and the universe not having any singularities but being completely selfcontained andwithout a boundary
3210,The trouble is as explained in Chapter  that the uncertainty principle means that evenempty space is filled with pairs of virtual particles and antiparticles
3211,These pairs would have an infinite amountof energy and therefore by Einsteins famous equation E  mc  they would have an infinite amount of mass
3212,Their gravitational attraction would thus curve up the universe to infinitely small size
3213,Rather similar seemingly absurd infinities occur in the other partial theories but in all these cases the infinitiescan be canceled out by a process called renormalization
3214,Although this technique is rather dubious mathematically it does seem to work in practice andhas been used with these theories to make predictions that agree with observations to an extraordinary degreeof accuracy
3215,In attempting to incorporate the uncertainty principle into general relativity one has only two quantities that canbe adjusted the strength of gravity and the value of the cosmological constant
3216,But adjusting these is notA Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
3217,One therefore has a theory that seems to predict that certain quantitiessuch as the curvature of spacetime are really infinite yet these quantities can be observed and measured tobe perfectly finite This problem in combining general relativity and the uncertainty principle had beensuspected for some time but was finally confirmed by detailed calculations in
3218,In a sense all theseparticles could then be regarded as different aspects of the same superparticle thus unifying the matterparticles with spin  and  with the forcecarrying particles of spin   and
3219,The virtual particleantiparticlepairs of spin  and  would have negative energy and so would tend to cancel out the positive energy of thespin   and  virtual pairs
3220,This would cause many of the possible infinities to cancel out but it wassuspected that some infinities might still remain
3221,Even with a computer it was reckoned it would take at least four years and the chances were very high thatone would make at least one mistake probably more
3222,So one would know one had the right answer only ifsomeone else repeated the calculation and got the same answer and that did not seem very likelyDespite these problems and the fact that the particles in the supergravity theories did not seem to match theobserved particles most scientists believed that supergravity was probably the right answer to the problem ofthe unification of physics
3223,It seemed the best way of unifying gravity with the other forces
3224,These strings may have ends the socalled open strings orthey may be joined up with themselves in closed loops closed strings Figure   and Figure
3225,html  of    AMFigures    A particle occupies one point of space at each instant of time
3226,Thus its history can be represented by a line inspacetime the worldline
3227,A string on the other hand occupies a line in space at each moment of time
3228,Soits history in spacetime is a twodimensional surface called the worldsheet
3229,Any point on such a worldsheetcan be described by two numbers one specifying the time and the other the position of the point on the string
3230,The worldsheet of an open string is a strip its edges represent the paths through spacetime of the ends of thestring Figure
3231,Two pieces of string can join together to form a single string in the case of open strings they simply join at theends Figure   while in the case of closed strings it is like the two legs joining on a pair of trousers Figure
3232,html  of    AMFigure   A Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
3233,html  of    AMFigure  Similarly a single piece of string can divide into two strings
3234,Theemission or absorption of one particle by another corresponds to the dividing or joining together of strings
3235,Forexample the gravitational force of the sun on the earth was pictured in particle theories as being caused by theemission of a graviton by a particle in the sun and its absorption by a particle in the earth Figure
3236,html  of    AMFigures    In string theory this process corresponds to an Hshaped tube or pipe Figure   string theory is rather like plumbing in a way
3237,The two vertical sides of the H correspond to the particles in the sun and the earth and thehorizontal crossbar corresponds to the graviton that travels between them
3238,It was originally invented in the late s in an attempt to find a theory todescribe the strong force
3239,The idea was that particles like the proton and the neutron could be regarded aswaves on a string
3240,The strong forces between the particles would correspond to pieces of string that wentbetween other bits of string as in a spiders web
3241,For this theory to give the observed value of the strong forcebetween particles the strings had to be like rubber bands with a pull of about ten tons
3242,The predictions of the string theory would be just the same as those of general relativity onnormal length scales but they would differ at very small distances less than a thousand million million millionmillion millionth of a centimeter a centimeter divided by  with thirtythree zeros after it
3243,So Schwarz was left alone as almost the only supporterof string theory but now with the much higher proposed value of the string tension
3244,In  interest in strings suddenly revived apparently for two reasons
3245,String theories also lead to infinities but it is thought they will all cancel out in versions like the heterotic stringA Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
3246,html  of    AMthough this is not yet known for certain
3247,The idea is to take a shortcut through the extra dimensions
3248,Imagine that the space we live in has only two dimensions and is curved like the surface of an anchor ring ortorus Figure
3249,Figure  If you were on one side of the inside edge of the ring and you wanted to get to a point on the other side youwould have to go round the inner edge of the ring
3250,If you look at it closely you see it is twodimensional the position of a point on thestraw is described by two numbers the length along the straw and the distance round the circular direction
3251,But if you look at it from a distance you dont see the thickness of the straw and it looks onedimensional theposition of a point is specified only by the length along the straw
3252,So it is with spacetime on a very small scaleit is tendimensional and highly curved but on bigger scales you dont see the curvature or the extradimensions
3253,If this picture is correct it spells bad news for wouldbe space travelers the extra dimensionswould be far too small to allow a spaceship through
3254,html  of    AMout while the other dimensions remain tightly curled upOne possible answer is the anthropic principle
3255,Two space dimensions do not seem to be enough to allow forthe development of complicated beings like us
3256,For example twodimensional animals living on aonedimensional earth would have to climb over each other in order to get past each other
3257,If a twodimensionalcreature ate something it could not digest completely it would have to bring up the remains the same way itswallowed them because if there were a passage right through its body it would divide the creature into twoseparate halves our twodimensional being would fall apart Figure
3258,Figure  There would also be problems with more than three space dimensions
3259,The gravitational force between twobodies would decrease more rapidly with distance than it does in three dimensions
3260,In three dimensions thegravitational force drops to  if one doubles the distance
3261,In four dimensions it would drop to  in fivedimensions to  and so on
3262,The significance of this is that the orbits of planets like the earth around the sunwould be unstable the least disturbance from a circular orbit such as would be caused by the gravitationalattraction of other planets would result in the earth spiraling away from or into the sun
3263,In fact the same behavior of gravity with distance in more than three space dimensionsmeans that the sun would not be able to exist in a stable state with pressure balancing gravity
3264,It would eitherfall apart or it would collapse to form a black hole
3265,In either case it would not be of much use as a source ofheat and light for life on earth
3266,On a smaller scale the electrical forces that cause the electrons to orbit roundthe nucleus in an atom would behave in the same way as gravitational forces
3267,Thus the electrons would eitherescape from the atom altogether or would spiral into the nucleus
3268,In either case one could not have atoms aswe know them
3269,A particle can be regarded as a brane and a string as a brane butthere were also pbranes for p to p
3270,They appear to be different approximations to some fundamental theory that arevalid in different situations
3271,People have searched for this underlying theory but without any success so far
3272,Instead it may be like maps  you cant use a single map todescribe the surface of the earth or an anchor ring you need at least two maps in the case of the earth and fourfor the anchor ring to cover every point
3273,Each map is valid only in a limited region but different maps will have aregion of overlap
3274,The collection of maps provides a complete description of the surface
3275,But can there really be such a unified theory Or are we perhaps just chasing a mirage There seem to bethree possibilities
3276,There is no ultimate theory of the universe just an infinite sequence of theories that describe the universemore and more accurately
3277,There is no theory of the universe events cannot be predicted beyond a certain extent but occur in a random and arbitrary manner
3278,Some would argue for the third possibility on the grounds that if there were a complete set of laws that wouldinfringe Gods freedom to change his mind and intervene in the world
3279,Its a bit like the old paradox can Godmake a stone so heavy that he cant lift it But the idea that God might want to change his mind is an exampleof the fallacy pointed out by St
3280,Augustine of imagining God as a being existing in time time is a property onlyof the universe that God created
3281,If one likes one could ascribe thisrandomness to the intervention of God but it would be a very strange kind of intervention there is no evidencethat it is directed toward any purpose
3282,Indeed if it were it would by definition not be random
3283,In modern timeswe have effectively removed the third possibility above by redefining the goal of science our aim is to formulatea set of laws that enables us to predict events only up to the limit set by the uncertainty principle
3284,The second possibility that there is an infinite sequence of more and more refined theories is in agreementwith all our experience so far
3285,On many occasions we have increased the sensitivity of our measurements ormade a new class of observations only to discover new phenomena that were not predicted by the existingtheory and to account for these we have had to develop a more advanced theory
3286,It would therefore not bevery surprising if the present generation of grand unified theories was wrong in claiming that nothing essentiallynew will happen between the electroweak unification energy of about  GeV and the grand unification energyof about a thousand million million GeV
3287,We might indeed expect to find several new layers of structure moreA Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
3288,html  of    AMbasic than the quarks and electrons that we now regard as elementary particles
3289,Thus it does seem that the sequence of more and more refined theories should havesome limit as we go to higher and higher energies so that there should be some ultimate theory of theuniverse
3290,But if the theory was mathematically consistent and always gave predictions that agreed with observations wecould be reasonably confident that it was the right one
3291,It would bring to an end a long and glorious chapter inthe history of humanitys intellectual struggle to understand the universe
3292,But it would also revolutionize theordinary persons understanding of the laws that govern the universe
3293,But since then the paceof the development of science has made this impossible
3294,Because theories are always being changed toaccount for new observations they are never properly digested or simplified so that ordinary people canunderstand them
3295,You have to be a specialist and even then you can only hope to have a proper grasp of asmall proportion of the scientific theories
3296,The rest of thepopulation has little idea of the advances that are being made or the excitement they are generating
3297,Seventyyears ago if Eddington is to be believed only two people understood the general theory of relativity
3298,Nowadaystens of thousands of university graduates do and many millions of people are at least familiar with the idea
3299,If acomplete unified theory was discovered it would only be a matter of time before it was digested and simplifiedin the same way and taught in schools at least in outline
3300,We would then all be able to have someunderstanding of the laws that govern the universe and are responsible for our existence
3301,Even if we do discover a complete unified theory it would not mean that we would be able to predict events ingeneral for two reasons
3302,The first is the limitation that the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics sets onour powers of prediction
3303,There is nothing we can do to get around that
3304,It arises from the fact that we could not solve the equations of the theoryexactly except in very simple situations
3305,We cannot even solve exactly for the motion of three bodies inNewtons theory of gravity and the difficulty increases with the number of bodies and the complexity of thetheory
3306,We already know the laws that govern the behavior of matter under all but the most extremeconditions
3307,In particular we know the basic laws that underlie all of chemistry and biology
3308,Yet we havecertainly not reduced these subjects to the status of solved problems we have as yet had little success inpredicting human behavior from mathematical equations So even if we do find a complete set of basic lawsthere will still be in the years ahead the intellectually challenging task of developing better approximationmethods so that we can make useful predictions of the probable outcomes in complicated and realisticsituations
3309,A complete consistent unified theory is only the first step our goal is a complete understanding of the events around us and of our own existence
3310,html  of    AM A Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
3311,html  of    AMCHAPTER  CONCLUSION   We find ourselves in a bewildering world
3312,Just as an infinite tower of tortoises supportingthe fiat earth is such a picture so is the theory of superstrings
3313,Both are theories of the universe though thelatter is much more mathematical and precise than the former
3314,Both theories lack observational evidence noone has ever seen a giant tortoise with the earth on its back but then no one has seen a superstring either
3315,These spirits inhabited natural objects like rivers and mountains including celestial bodies like thesun and moon
3316,They had to be placated and their favor sought in order to ensure the fertility of the soil and therotation of the seasons
3317,Further the sun the moon and the planets followed precise paths across the sky that could be predicted inadvance with considerable accuracy
3318,At first these regularities and laws were obvious only in astronomy and a few other situations
3319,The success of these laws led Laplace at the beginning of the nineteenth century to postulatescientific determinism that is he suggested that there would be a set of laws that would determine theevolution of the universe precisely given its configuration at one time
3320,In effect Godwas confined to the areas that nineteenthcentury science did not understand
3321,We now know that Laplaces hopes of determinism cannot be realized at least in the terms he had in mind
3322,The uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics implies that certain pairs of quantities such as the position andvelocity of a particle cannot both be predicted with complete accuracy
3323,These quantum theories are deterministic in the sense that they give laws for theevolution of the wave with time
3324,Thus if one knows the wave at one time one can calculate it at any other time
3325,But maybe that is our mistake maybe there are no particle positions and velocitiesbut only waves
3326,It is just that we try to fit the waves to our preconceived ideas of positions and velocities
3327,In effect we have redefined the task of science to be the discovery of laws that will enable us to predict eventsup to the limits set by the uncertainty principle
3328,Thelaws of gravity were incompatible with the view held until quite recently that the universe is unchanging in timeA Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
3329,html  of    AMthe fact that gravity is always attractive implies that the universe must be either expanding or contracting
3330,It seems that this idea could explain manyof the observed features of the universe such as its largescale uniformity and also the smallerscaledepartures from homogeneity like galaxies stars and even human beings
3331,It could even account for the arrowof time that we observe
3332,But if the universe is completely selfcontained with no singularities or boundariesand completely described by a unified theory that has profound implications for the role of God as Creator
3333,He would of course stillhave had the freedom to choose the laws that the universe obeyed
3334,Even if there is only one possible unified theory it is just a set of rules and equations
3335,Philosophers reduced the scope of their inquiries so much that Wittgenstein the most famous philosopher ofthis century said The sole remaining task for philosophy is the analysis of language
3336,If we find the answer tothat it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason  for then we would know the mind of God
3337,ALBERT EINSTEINEinsteins connection with the politics of the nuclear bomb is well known he signed the famous letter toPresident Franklin Roosevelt that persuaded the United States to take the idea seriously and he engaged inpostwar efforts to prevent nuclear war
3338,But these were not just the isolated actions of a scientist dragged intothe world of politics
3339,Einsteins life was in fact to use his own words divided between politics and equations
3340,html  of    AMadvocacy of civil disobedience and public encouragement of people to refuse conscription did little to endearhim to his colleagues
3341,Then following the war he directed his efforts toward reconciliation and improvinginternational relations
3342,This too did not make him popular and soon his politics were making it difficult for him tovisit the United States even to give lectures
3343,Although he was Jewish by descent Einstein rejected the biblicalidea of God
3344,Once more unpopularity did not stop him from speaking his mind
3345,His theories came under attack anantiEinstein organization was even set up
3346,One man was convicted of inciting others to murder Einstein andfined a mere six dollars
3347,Einstein was in America and declared he would not return to Germany
3348,Thenwhile Nazi militia raided his house and confiscated his bank account a Berlin newspaper displayed theheadline Good News from Einstein  Hes Not Coming Back
3349,In the face of the Nazi threat Einsteinrenounced pacifism and eventually fearing that German scientists would build a nuclear bomb proposed thatthe United States should develop its own
3350,But even before the first atomic bomb had been detonated he waspublicly warning of the dangers of nuclear war and proposing international control of nuclear weaponry
3351,Throughout his life Einsteins efforts toward peace probably achieved little that would last  and certainly wonhim few friends
3352,He declined saying he thought he was too naive in politics
3353,But perhaps hisreal reason was different to quote him again Equations are more important to me because politics is for thepresent but an equation is something for eternity
3354,GALILEO GALILEIGalileo perhaps more than any other single person was responsible for the birth of modern science
3355,He wrote aboutCopernicuss theory in Italian not the usual academic Latin and soon his views became widely supportedoutside the universities
3356,Galileo worried by this traveled to Rome to speak to the ecclesiastical authorities
3357,But the Church was afraid of a scandal that mightundermine its fight against Protestantism and so took repressive measures
3358,It declared Copernicanism falseand erroneous in  and commanded Galileo never again to defend or hold the doctrine
3359,The book Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems was completed and published in  with the full backing of the censors  and was immediately greeted throughout Europe as a literary and philosophicalmasterpiece
3360,Soon the Pope realizing that people were seeing the book as a convincing argument in favor ofA Brief History of Time  Stephen Hawking
3361,The Pope argued that although the book had theofficial blessing of the censors Galileo had nevertheless contravened the  decree
3362,Galileo remained a faithful Catholic but his belief in the independence of science had not been crushed
3363,Fouryears before his death in  while he was still under house arrest the manuscript of his second major bookwas smuggled to a publisher in Holland
3364,It was this work referred to as Two New Sciences even more than his support for Copernicus that was to be the genesis of modern physics
3365,His relations with other academics were notorious with most of his laterlife spent embroiled in heated disputes
3366,Following publication of Principia Mathematica  surely the most influential book ever written in physics  Newton had risen rapidly into public prominence
3367,He was appointedpresident of the Royal Society and became the first scientist ever to be knighted
3368,Newton would not take no for an answer he had himself appointed to the governing body of the Royal Observatory and then triedto force immediate publication of the data
3369,Eventually he arranged for Flamsteeds work to be seized andprepared for publication by Flamsteeds mortal enemy Edmond Halley
3370,But Flamsteed took the case to courtand in the nick of time won a court order preventing distribution of the stolen work
3371,Newton was incensed andsought his revenge by systematically deleting all references to Flamsteed in later editions of Principia
3372,A more serious dispute arose with the German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz
3373,Although we now know that Newton discovered calculus years before Leibniz he published his work muchlater
3374,Newton as president appointed an impartial committee toinvestigate coincidentally consisting entirely of Newtons friends But that was not all Newton then wrote thecommittees report himself and had the Royal Society publish it officially accusing Leibniz of plagiarism
3375,Stillunsatisfied he then wrote an anonymous review of the report in the Royal Societys own periodical
3376,Followingthe death of Leibniz Newton is reported to have declared that he had taken great satisfaction in breakingLeibnizs heart
3377,During the period of these two disputes Newton had already left Cambridge and academe
3378,He had been activein antiCatholic politics at Cambridge and later in Parliament and was rewarded eventually with the lucrativepost of Warden of the Royal Mint
3379,Here he used his talents for deviousness and vitriol in a more sociallyacceptable way successfully conducting a major campaign against counterfeiting even sending several men totheir death on the gallows

3456,It also creates a filtering approach using the discrete characteristics of items while recommending additional items
3457,Compare Sas R And Python Programming Answer SAS  it is one of the most widely used analytics tools used by some of the biggest companies on earth
3458,It has some of the best statistical functions graphical user interface but can come with a price tag and hence it cannot be readily adopted by smaller enterprises R  The best part about R is that it is an Open Source tool and hence used generously by academia and the research community
3459,It is a robust tool for statistical computation graphical representation and reporting
3460,Due to its open source nature it is always being updated with the latest features and then readily available to everybody
3461,Python  Python is a powerful open source programming language that is easy to learn works well with most other tools and technologies
3462,The best part about Python is that it has innumerable libraries and community created modules making it very robust
3463,It has functions for statistical operation model building and more
3464,Explain The Various Benefits Of R Language Answer The R programming language includes a set of software suite that is used for graphical representation statistical computing data manipulation and calculation
3465,Data Scientists can learn about the consumer behavior interest engagement retention and finally conversion all through the power of insightful statistics
3466,It helps them to build powerful data models in order to validate certain inferences and predictions
3467,The outcome has to be a binary outcome that is either zero or one or a yes or no
3468,Data cleansing extensively deals with the process of detecting and correcting of data records ensuring that data is complete and accurate and the components of data that are irrelevant are deleted or modified as per the needs
3469,This process can be deployed in concurrence with data wrangling or batch processing
3470,Once the data is cleaned it confirms with the rules of the data sets in the system
3471,Data cleansing is an essential part of the data science because the data can be prone to error due to human negligence corruption during transmission or storage among other things
3472,AnswerAs the name suggests these are analysis methodologies having a single double or multiple variables
3473,So a univariate analysis will have one variable and due to this there are no relationships causes
3474,The major aspect of the univariate analysis is to summarize the data and find the patterns within it to make actionable decisions
3475,A Bivariate analysis deals with the relationship between two sets of data
3476,These sets of paired data come from related sources or samples
3477,If the data can be quantified then it can analyzed using a graph plot or a scatterplot
3478,The strength of the correlation between the two data sets will be tested in a Bivariate analysis
3479,Search engine  Ranking pages depending on the personal preferences of the searcher Finance  Evaluating investment opportunities  risks detecting fraudulent transactions Medicare  Designing drugs depending on the patients history and needs Robotics  Machine learning for handling situations that are out of the ordinary Social media  Understanding relationships and recommending connections Extraction of information  framing questions for getting answers from databases over the web
3480,It has got more to do with the type of domain that we are dealing with andfamiliarizing the system to learn more about it
3481,Feature Selection This step has got more to do with the feature that we are selecting from the set of features that we have
3482,Sometimes it happens that there are a lot of features and we have to make an intelligent decision regarding the type of feature that we want to select to go ahead with our machine learning endeavor
3483,Algorithm This is a vital step since the algorithms that we choose will have a very major impact on the entire process of machine learning
3484,Some of the algorithms used are Support Vector Machines Decision Trees Nave Bayes KMeans Clustering etc
3485,The training is done based on the data that we have and providing more real world experiences
3486,With each consequent training step the machine gets better and smarter and able to take improved decisions
3487,Evaluation In this step we actually evaluate the decisions taken by the machine in order to decide whether it is up to the mark or not
3488,Optimization This process involves improving the performance of the machine learning process using various optimization techniques
3489,The best part of optimization techniques is that machine learning is not just a consumer of optimization techniques but it also provides new ideas for optimization too
3490,Testing Here various tests are carried out and some these are unseen set of test cases
3491,There are various testing techniques like crossvalidation in order to deal with multiple situations
3492,It can be considered as a continuous probability distributionand is useful in statistics
3493,The nonnormal distribution approaches the normal distribution as the size of the samples increases
3494,It is also very easy to deploy the Central Limit Theorem
3495,This method helps to make sense of data that is random by creating an order and interpreting the results using a bellshaped graph
3496,The Linear Regression method is used to describe relationship between a dependent variable and one or independent variable
3497,The main task in the Linear Regression is the method of fitting a single line within a scatter plot
3498,For example you want to know the effect of a certain action in order to determine the various outcomes and extent of effect the cause has in determining the final outcome
3499,Extrapolation is the determination or estimation using a known set of values or facts by extending it and taking it to an area or region that is unknown
3500,It is the technique of inferring something using data that is available
3501,It is involvedwith the process of determining the sample size needed for detecting an effect of a given size from a cause with a certain degree of assurance
3502,It lets you deploy specific probability in a sample size constraint
3503,The various techniques of statistical power analysis and sample size estimation are widely deployed for making statistical judgment that are accurate and evaluate the size needed for experimental effects in practice
3504,Power analysis lets you understand the sample size estimate so that they are neither high nor low
3505,A low sample size there will be no authentication to provide reliable answers and if it is large there will be wastage of resources
3506,It is the method of classifying data using a certain set of clusters called as K clusters
3507,It is deployed for grouping data in order to find similarity in the data
3508,It includes defining the K centers one each in a cluster
3509,The clusters are defined into K groups with K being predefined
3510,The K points are selected at random as cluster centers
3511,The objects within a cluster are as closely related to one another as possible and differ as much as possible to the objects in other clusters
3512,K means clustering works very well for large sets of data
3513,Data modeling creates a conceptual model based on the relationship between various data models
3514,The process involves moving from the conceptual stage to the logical model to the physical schema
3515,It involves the systematic method of applying the data modeling techniques
3516,Database Design  This is the process of designing the database
3517,Strictly speaking database design includes the detailed logical model of a database but it can also include physical design choices and storage parameters
3518,Answer Take the entire data set as input Look for a split that maximizes the separation of the classes
3519,It is basically a technique of problem solving used for isolating the root causes of faults or problems
3520,A factor is called a root cause if its deduction from the problemfaultsequence averts the final undesirable event from reoccurring
3521,The goal of crossvalidation is to term a data set to test the model in the training phase i
3522,Do Gradient Descent Methods At All Times Converge To Similar Point Answer No they do not because in some cases it reaches a local minima or a local optima point
3523,This is governed by the data and the starting conditions
3524,The objective of AB Testing is to detect any changes to the web page to maximize or increase the outcome of an interest
3525,Answer It is a traditional database schema with a central table
3526,Satellite tables map IDs to physical name or description and can be connected to the central fact table using the ID fields these tables are known as lookup tables and are principally useful in realtime applications as they save a lot of memory
3527,Sometimes star schemas involve several layers of summarization to recover information faster
3528,In data analysis we usually calculate the eigenvectors for a correlation or covariance matrix
3529,The steps involved are Build several decision trees on bootstrapped training samples of data On each tree each time a split is considered a random sample of mm predictors is chosen as split candidates out of all pp predictors Rule of thumb  at each split mpmp Predictions  at the majority rule
3530,Logistic Regression often referred as logit model is a technique to predict the binary outcome from a linear combination of predictor variables
3531,For example if you want to predict whether a particular political leader will win the election or not
3532,In this case the outcome of prediction is binary i
3533,The predictor variables here would be the amount of money spent for election campaigning of a particular candidate the amount of time spent in campaigning etc
3534,Recommender systems are widely used in movies news research articles products social tags music etc
3535,It might take up to  of the time for just cleaning data making it a critical part of analysis task
3536,For example the pie charts of sales based on territory involve only one variable and can be referred to as univariate analysis
3537,If the analysis attempts to understand the difference between  variables at time as in a scatterplot then it is referred to as bivariate analysis
3538,For example analysing the volume of sale and a spending can be considered as an example of bivariate analysis
3539,Analysis that deals with the study of more than two variables to understand the effect of variables on the responses is referred to as multivariate analysis
3540,The random variables are distributed in the form of an symmetrical bell shaped curve
3541,X is referred to as the predictor variable and Y as the criterion variable
3542,Extrapolation is approximating a value by extending a known set of values or facts
3543,In systematic sampling the list is progressed in a circular manner so once you reach the end ofthe listit is progressed from the top again
3544,The best example for systematic sampling is equal probability method
3545,Are expected value and mean value different They are not different but the terms are used in different contexts
3546,For Sampling Data Mean value is the only value that comes from the sampling data
3547,Expected Value is the mean of all the means i
3548,For Distributions Mean value and Expected value are same irrespective of the distribution under the condition that the distribution is in the same population
3549,Pvalue helps the readers to draw conclusions and is always between  and
3550,is the marginal value indicating it is possible to go either way
3551,Do gradient descent methods always converge to same point No they do not because in some cases it reaches a local minima or a local optima point
3552,There is a population with a  rate of having the condition the test identifies
3553,Thus there is a  error in case you do not have the illness
3554,Out of the remaining  people  will also get true positive result
3555,Close to  people will get a true positive result for the disease
3556,This means that out of  people  people will be tested positive for the disease even though only one person has the illness
3557,There is only a  probability of you having the disease even if your reports say that you have the disease
3558,If the algorithm does not learn anything beforehand because there is no response variable or any training data then it is referred to as unsupervised learning
3559,The goal of AB Testing is to identify any changes to the web page to maximize or increase the outcome of an interest
3560,An example for this could be identifying the click through rate for a banner ad
3561,In data analysis we usually calculate the eigenvectors for a correlation or covariance matrix
3562,If the number of outlier values is few then they can be assessed individually but for large number of outliers the values can be substituted with either the th or the st percentile values
3563,The most common ways to treat outlier values   To change the value and bring in within a range  To just remove the value
3564,Concordance that helps identify the ability of the logistic model to differentiate between the event happening and not happening
3565,Lift helps assess the logistic model by comparing it with random selection
3566,Prepare the data for modelling by detecting outliers treating missing values transforming variables etc
3567,After data preparation start running the model analyse the result and tweak the approach
3568,This is an iterative step till the best possible outcome is achieved
3569,Start implementing the model and track the result to analyse the performance of the model over the period of time
3570,If any patterns are identified the analyst has to concentrate on them as it could lead to interesting and meaningful business insights
3571,If there are no patterns identified then the missing values can be substituted with mean or median values imputation or they can simply be ignored
3572,If it is a categorical variable the default value is assigned
3573,If you have a distribution of data coming for normal distribution give the mean value
3574,Should we even treat missing values is another important point to consider If  of the values for a variable are missing then you can answer that you would be dropping the variable instead of treating the missing values
3575,For some reason or the other the response variable for a regression analysis might not satisfy one or more assumptions of an ordinary least squares regression
3576,The residuals could either curve as the prediction increases or  follow skewed distribution
3577,In such scenarios it is necessary to transform the response variable so that the data  meets the required assumptions
3578,A Box cox transformation is a statistical technique to transform nonmornla dependent variables into a normal shape
3579,If the given data is not normal then most of the statistical techniques assume normality
3580,Applying a box cox transformation means that you can run a broader number of tests
3581,Can you use machine learning for time series analysis Yes it can be used but it depends on the applications
3582,Write a function that takes in two sorted lists and outputs a sorted list that is their union
3583,In that case you will have to write your own logic to answer the question and impress your interviewer
3584,Python code def returnunionlista listb     len  lenlista     len  lenlistb     finalsortedlist       j       k       for i in rangelenlen         if k  len             finalsortedlist
3585,appendlistbj             j       return finalsortedlist Similar function can be returned in R as well by following the similar steps
3586,As a result of Bayesian Estimate we get multiple models for making multiple predcitions i
3587,one for each pair of parameters but with the same prior
3588,So if a new example need to be predicted than computing the weighted sum of these predictions serves the purpose
3589,Maximum likelihood does not take prior into consideration ignores the prior so it is like being a Bayesian  while using some kind of a flat prior
3590,Ask the machine to look at the data and identify the coefficient values in an equation
3591,For example for the linear regression ymxc we give the data for the variable x y and the machine learns about the values of m and c from the data
3592,The objective of clustering is to group similar entities in a way that the entities within a group are similar to each other but the groups are different from each other
3593,Within Sum of squares is generally used to explain the homogeneity within a cluster
3594,This point is known as bending point and taken as K in K  Means
3595,This is the widely used approach but few data scientists also use Hierarchical clustering first to create dendograms and identify the distinct groups from there
3596,Is it better to have too many false negatives or too many false positives  Is it possible to perform logistic regression with Microsoft Excel It is possible to perform logistic regression with Microsoft Excel
3597,Lets use a sample data to learn about logistic regression using Excel
3598,We have kept only  categories for our purpose of binary logistic regression classifier
3599,Next we have to create a logit function using independent variables i
3600,Logit  L         X       X We have kept the initial values of beta  beta  as
3601,for now and we will use Excel Solve to optimize the beta values in order to maximize our log likelihood estimate
3602,Assuming that you are aware of logistic regression basics we calculate probability values from Logit using following formula Probability  eLogit eLogit  e is base of natural logarithm i
3603,Lets put it into excel formula to calculate probability values for each of the observation
3604,The conditional probability    is the probability of Predicted Y given set of independent variables X
3605,We have to maximize H by optimizing B   B   and B
3606,To load an addin in Excel Go to File  Options  AddIns and see if checkbox in front of required addin is checked or not Make sure to check it to load an addin into Excel
3607,If you dont see Solver Addin there go to the bottom of the screen Manage AddIns and click on OK
3608,Once you have your Solver loaded click on Solver icon under Data tab and You will see a new window popped up like                Put H in set objective select max and fill cells E to E in next form field
3609,By doing this we have told Solver to Maximize H by changing values in cells E to E
3610,In case it is not able to converge it will throw an error
3611,Select Keep Solver Solution and Click on OK to accept the solution provided by Solver
3612,Now you can see that value of Beta coefficients from B   B   B   have changed and our Log Likelihood function has been maximized
3613,Using these values of Betas you can calculate the probability and hence response variable by deciding the probability cutoff
3614,Distributions that have more observations on one side of the graph than the other  are referred to as skewed distribution
3615,Distributions with fewer observations on the left  towards lower values are said to be skewed left and distributions with fewer observation on the right  towards higher values are said to be skewed right
3616,You created a predictive model of a quantitative outcome variable using multiple regressions
3617,One day all of a sudden your wife asks Darling do you remember all anniversary surprises from me
3618,To save your life you need to Recall all  anniversary surprises from your memory
3619,Thus RecallR is the ratio of number of events you can correctly recall to the number of all correct events
3620,If you can recall all the  surprises correctly then the recall ratio is   but if you can recall only  suprises correctly of the  then the recall ratio is
3621,For instance you answer  times  times the surprises you guess are correct and  wrong
3622,This implies that your recall ratio is  but the precision is
3623,Precision is the ratio of number of events you can correctly recall to a number of all events you recall combination of wrong and correct recalls
3624,L  L regularizations are generally used to add constraints to optimization problems
3625,If you observe in L   there is a high likelihood to hit the corners as solutions while in L   it doesnt
3626,In other words errors are squared in L   so model sees higher error and tries to minimize that squared error
3627,stationary sales decreases during holiday season air conditioner sales increases during the summers etc
3628,Seasonality makes your time series nonstationary because average value of the variables at different time periods
3629,Differentiating a time series is generally known as the best method of removing seasonality from a time series
3630,Seasonal differencing can be defined as a numerical difference between a particular value and a value with a periodic lag i
3631,In medical field assume you have to give chemo therapy to patients
3632,Your lab tests patients for certain vital information and based on those results they decide to give radiation therapy to a patient
3633,Assume a patient comes to that hospital and he is tested positive for cancer But he doesnt have cancer based on lab prediction
3634,They send free voucher mail directly to  customers without any minimum purchase condition because they assume to make at least  profit on sold items above K
3635,Due to shortage of staff they decided to scan passenger being predicted as risk positives by their predictive model
3636,Banks dont want to lose good customers and at the same point of time they dont want to acquire bad customers
3637,In this scenario both the false positives and false negatives be come very important to measure
3638,These days we hear many cases of players using steroids during sport competitions Every player has to go through a steroid test before the game starts
3639,A false positive can ruin the career of a Great sportsman and a false negative can make the game unfair
3640,Can you explain the difference between a Test Set and a Validation Set Validation set can be considered as a part of the training set as it is used for parameter selection and to avoid Overfitting of the model being built
3641,On the other hand test set is used for testing or evaluating the performance of a trained machine leaning model
3642,In simple terms the differences can be summarized as Training Set is to fit the parameters i
3643,Test Set is to assess the performance of the model i
3644,Selection bias implies that the obtained sample does not exactly represent the population that was actually intended to be analyzed
3645,Selection bias consists of Sampling Bias Data Attribute and Time Interval
3646,SVM and Random Forest are both used in classification problems
3647,a      If you are sure that your data is outlier free and clean then go for SVM
3648,It is the opposite    if your data might contain outliers then Random forest would be the best choice b      Generally SVM consumes more computational power than Random Forest so if you are constrained with memory go for Random Forest  machine learning algorithm
3649,c   Random Forest gives you a very good idea of variable importance in your data so if you want to have variable importance then choose Random Forest machine learning algorithm
3650,d      Random Forest machine learning algorithms are preferred for multiclass problems
3651,e     SVM is preferred in multidimensional problem set  like text classification but as a good data scientist you should experiment with both of them and testfor accuracy or rather you can use ensemble of many Machine Learning techniques
3652,If not done properly it could potentially result into selection bias
3653,You could achieve a selection bias if your values are not missing at random and they have some pattern
3654,Assume you are conducting a survey and few people didnt specify their gender
3655,In this case your values will not be fully correct as they are coming from population sets
3656,Mean Substitution  In this method missing values are replaced with mean of other available values
3657,standard deviation correlation and regression are mostly dependent on the mean value of variables
3658,Hence various data management procedures might include selection bias in your data if not chosen correctly
3659,Explain About Data Import In R Language Answer R Commander is used to import data in R language
3660,To start the R commander GUI the user must type in the command Rcmdr into the console
3661,Data can also be entered directly using the editor of R Commander via DataNew Data Set
3662,Data can also be imported from a URL or from a plain text file ASCII from any other statistical package or from the clipboard
3663,The best way to answer this question would be to mention that deleting missing values is not a good idea because the probable cause for missing value could be some problem with data collection or programming or the query
3664,It is good to find the root cause of the missing values and then take necessary steps handle them
3665,R Language Has Several Packages For Solving A Particular Problem
3666,The best way for beginners to answer this question is to mention that they would look for a package that follows good software development principles
3667,The next thing would be to look for user reviews and find out if other data scientists or analysts have been able to solve a similar problem
3668,This helps others to verify the findings add to them and engage in discussions
3669,Reproducible research makes it easy to redo the experiments by inserting new data and applying it to a different problem
3670,Homogeneous data structures have same type of objects   Vector Matrix ad Array
3671,Heterogeneous data structures have different type of objects   Dataframes and lists
3672,frame  edit MyTable The above code will open an Excel Spreadsheet for entering data into MyTable
3673,Learn Data Science in R Programming to land a top gig as an Enterprise Data Scientist Question
3674,Explain About The Significance Of Transpose In R Language Answer Transpose t  is the easiest method for reshaping the data before analysis
3675,Dplyr Package Is Used To Speed Up Data Frame Management Code
3676,MapReduce jobs submitted from either Oozie Pig or Hive can be used to encode improve and sample the data sets from HDFS into R
3677,This helps to leverage complex analysis tasks on the subset of data prepared in R
3678,In this algorithm the function is approximated locally and any computations are deferred until classification
3679,If You Want To Know All The Values In C      That Are Not In C
3680,Write A Function In R Language To Replace The Missing Value In A Vector With The Mean Of That Vector Answer mean impute  functionx x is
3681,The disadvantage of using vapply is that it is difficult to be implemented and more verbose
3682,matrixX  returns TRUE then X can be termed as a matrix data object
3683,Example  Vector A c and Vector B then the result of AB will be
3684,matrixX returns true then X can be considered as a matrix data object otheriwse not
3685,Subset  function is used to select variables and observations from a given dataset
3686,Pairs function takes various parameters like formula data subset labels etc
3687,The two key parameters required to build a scatter plot matrix are  formula  A formula basically like abc
3688,It basically represents the series of variables used in pairs
3689,element  function also returns a Boolean value either true or false based on whether it is present in a vector or not
3690,On the flip side library  function gives an error message if the desired package cannot be loaded

3696,empage Yes it is a linear equation as the coefficients are linear
3697,R base package provides basic fucntionalites in R environment like arithmetic calcualtions inputoutput
3698,Merge  function basically finds the intersection between two different sets of data
3699,Merge  function in R language takes a long list of arguments as follows  Syntax for using Merge function in R language  merge x y by
3700,X  Variable name in dataframe X that is common in Y
3701,Y  Variable name in dataframe Y that is common in X
3702,x   It is a logical value that specifies the type of merge
3703,X should be setto true if we want all the observations from dataframe X
3704,y   It is a logical value that specifies the type of merge
3705,y should be set to true  if we want all the observations from dataframe Y
3706,This should be set to true if you want all the observations from dataframe X and Y resulting in Outer join
3707,Suppose there is a vector ac    and vector b    then the multiplication of the vectors ab will give the resultant as    with the warning message
3708,The multiplication is performed in a sequential manner but since the length is not same the first element of the smaller vector b will be multiplied with the last element of the larger vector a
3709,The best way to answer this question is to look for an R package that follows good software development principles and practices
3710,For example you might want to look at the quality documentation and unit tests
3711,It is important to know if other data scientists or data analysts have been able to solve a similar problem as that of yours
3712,numeric function in R does not return original values but returns the vector of the levels of the factor variable
3713,Unsupervised Machine learning Unsupervised machine learning doesnt required labeled data
3714,Low bias machine learning algorithms  Decision Trees kNN and SVM Hight bias machine learning algorithms  Liear Regression Logistic Regression Variance Variance is error introduced in your model due to complex machine learning algorithm your model learns noise also from the training dataset and performs bad on test dataset
3715,Normally as you increase the complexity of your model you will see a reduction in error due to lower bias in the model
3716,As you continue to make your model more complex you end up overfitting your model and hence your model will start suffering from high variance
3717,Bias Variance trade off The goal of any supervised machine learning algorithm is to have low bias and low variance to achive good prediction performance
3718,There is no escaping the relationship between bias and variance in machine learning
3719,At an extreme the values of weights can become so large as to overflow and result in NaN values
3720,This has the effect of your model being unstable and unable to learn from your training data
3721,Gradient Gradient is the  direction and magnitude  calculated during training of a neural network that is used to update the network weights in the right direction and by the right amount
3722,Various measures such as errorrate accuracy specificity sensitivity precision and recall are derived from it
3723,Confusion MatrixA dataset used for performance evaluation is called test dataset
3724,The predicted labels will exactly the same if the performance of a binary classfier is perfect
3725,The predicted labels usually match with part of the observed labels in real world scenarios
3726,A binary classifier predicts all data instances of a test dataset as either positive or negative
3727,False negativeFN  Incorrect negative prediction Basic measures derived from the confusion matrix
3728,It is often used as aproxy for the tradeoff between the sensitivitytrue positive rate and false positive rate
3729,If you have n features in your training dataset SVM tries to plot it in ndimentional space with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate
3730,SVM uses hyper planes to seperate out different classes based on the provided kernel function
3731,In the above diagram we see that the thinner lines mark the distance from the classifier to the closest data points called the support vectors darkened data points
3732,The distance between the two thin lines is called the margin
3733,Decision tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm mainly used for the  Regression and Classification
3734,It breaks down a dataset into smaller and smaller subsets while at the same time an associated decision tree is incrementally developed
3735,The final result is a tree with decision nodes and leaf nodes
3736,ID  uses  Enteropy  and  Information Gain  to construct a decision tree
3737,Entropy A decision tree is built topdown from a root node and involve partitioning of data into homogenious subsets
3738,ID  uses enteropy to check the homogeneity of a sample
3739,If the sample is completely homogenious then entropy is zero and if the sample is an equally divided it has entropy of one
3740,Information Gain The  Information Gain  is based on the decrease in entropy after a dataset is split on an attribute
3741,Constructing a decision tree is all about finding attributes that returns the highest information gain
3742,Ensemble learning has many types but two more popular ensemble learning techniques are mentioned below
3743,Bagging Bagging tries to implement similar learners on small sample populations and then takes a mean of all the predictions
3744,In generalized bagging you can use different learners on different population
3745,As you expect this helps us to reduce the variance error
3746,If an observation was classfied incorrectly it tries to increase the weight of this observation and vice versa
3747,Boosting in general decreases the bias error and builds strong predictive models
3748,It is also used for dimentionality reduction treats missing values outlier values
3749,In Random Forest we grow multiple trees as opposed to a single tree
3750,To classify a new object based on attributes each tree gives a classification
3751,The forest chooses the classification having the  most votes Over all the trees in the forest and in case of regression it takes the  average  of outputs by different trees
3752,Instead of using kfold crossvalidation you should be aware to the fact that a time series is not randomly distributed data  It is inherently ordered by chronological order
3753,fold  training test fold  training  test fold  training   test fold  training    test
3754,Logistic Regression often referred as logit model is a technique to predict the binary outcome from a linear combination of predictor variables
3755,For example if you want to predict whether a particular political leader will win the election or not
3756,In this case the outcome of prediction is binary i
3757,The predictor variables here would be the amount of money spent for election campaigning of a particular candidate the amount of time spent in campaigning etc
3758,The random variables are distributed in the form of an symmetrical bell shaped curve
3759,The residuals could either curve as the prediction increases or follow skewed distribution
3760,In such scenarios it is necessary to transform the response variable so that the data meets the required assumptions
3761,A Box cox transformation is a statistical technique to transform nonnormal dependent variables into a normal shape
3762,If the given data is not normal then most of the statistical techniques assume normality
3763,Applying a box cox transformation means that you can run a broader number of tests
3764,A Box Cox transformation is a way to transform nonnormal dependent variables into a normal shape
3765,Normality is an important assumption for many statistical techniques if your data isnt normal applying a BoxCox means that you are able to run a broader number of tests
3766,Within Sum of squares is generally used to explain the homogeneity within a cluster
3767,This point is known as bending point and taken as K in K  Means
3768,This is the widely used approach but few data scientists also use Hierarchical clustering first to create dendograms and identify the distinct groups from there
3769,We have a lot numbers of algorithms under machine learning like Linear regression SVM Neural network etc and deep learning is just an extention of Neural networks
3770,To understand recurrent nets first you have to understand the basics of feedforward nets
3771,Both these networks RNN and feedforward named after the way they channel information throgh a series of mathematical oprations performed at the nodes of the network
3772,One feeds information throgh straightnever touching same node twice while the other cycles it throgh loop and the latter are called recurrent
3773,The BTSXPE at the bottom of the drawing represents the input example in the current moment and CONTEXT UNIT represents the output of the previous moment
3774,The decision a recurrent neural network reached at time t affects the decision that it will reach one moment later at time t
3775,The error they generate will return via backpropagation and be used to adjust their weights until error cant go any lower
3776,Remember the purpose of recurrent nets is to accurately classify sequential input
3777,We rely on the backpropagation of error and gradient descent to do so
3778,Backpropagation in feedforward networks moves backward from the final error through the outputs weights and inputs of each hidden layer assigning those weights responsibility for a portion of the error by calculating their partial derivatives  Ew or the relationship between their rates of change
3779,Recurrent networks rely on an extension of backpropagation called backpropagation through time or BPTT
3780,Reinforcement learning Deep learning Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithmsinspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks
3781,The end result is to maximize the numerical reward signal
3782,Reinforcement learning is inspired by the learning of human beings it is based on the rewardpanelity mechanism
3783,The phrase selection bias most often refers to the distortion of a statistical analysis resulting from the method of collecting samples
3784,If the selection bias is not taken into account then some conclusions of the study may not be accurate
3785,Regularization Regularization is the process of adding tunning parameter to a model to induce smoothness in order to prevent overfitting
3786,This is most often done by adding aconstant multiple to an existing weight vector
3787,The model predictions should then minimize the loss function calculated on the regularized training set
3788,It is often used as a weighting factor in information retrieval and text mining
3789,Recommender systems are widely used in movies news research articles products social tags music etc
3790,Both Regression and classification machine learning techniques come under  Supervised machine learning algorithms
3791,In Supervised machine learning algorithm we have to train the model using labeled dataset While training we have to explicitly provide the correct labels and algorithm tries to learn the pattern from input to output
3792,If our labels are discreate values then it will a classification problem e
3793,but if our labels are continuous values then it will be a regression problem e
3794,If you are having GB RAM in your machine and you want to train your model on GB dataset
3795,For Neural networks  Batch size with Numpy array will work
3796,Numpy array has property to create mapping of complete dataset it doesnt load complete dataset in memory
3797,You can pass index to Numpy array to get required data
3798,Use partialfit method of SVM it requires subset of complete dataset
3799,Based on the value it will denote the strength of the results
3800,To put it in another way High P values your data are likely with a true null
3801,Low P values your data are unlikely with a true null
3802,Bayes theoram describes the probablitiy of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event
3803,Data Science is a blend of various tools algorithms and machine learning principles with the goal to discover hidden patterns from the raw data
3804,Good understanding of the builtin data types especially lists dictionaries tuples and sets
3805,Ability to perform elementwise vector and matrix operations on NumPy arrays
3806,Knowing that you should use the Anaconda distribution and the conda package manager
3807,ScikitLearn Cheat Sheet  Ability to write efficient list comprehensions instead of traditional for loops
3808,Ability to write small clean functions important for any developer preferably pure functions that dont alter objects
3809,The following will help to tackle any problem in data analytics and machine learning
3810,It is the distortion of statistical analysis resulting from the method of collecting samples
3811,If the selection bias is not taken into account then some conclusions of the study may not be accurate
3812,Sampling bias  It is a systematic error due to a nonrandom sample of a population causing some members of the population to be less likely to be included than others resulting in a biased sample
3813,Time interval  A trial may be terminated early at an extreme value often for ethical reasons but the extreme value is likely to be reached by the variable with the largest variance even if all variables have a similar mean
3814,Attrition  Attrition bias is a kind of selection bias caused by attrition loss of participants discounting trial subjectstests that did not run  to completion
3815,In the  long  format each row is a onetime point per subject
3816,You can recognize data in wide format by the fact that columns generally represent groups
3817,The random variables are distributed in the form of a symmetrical bellshaped curve
3818,Mean Mode and Median are all located in the center
3819,The goal of AB Testing is to identify any changes to the web page to maximize or increase the outcome of an interest
3820,AB testing is a fantastic method for figuring out the best online promotional and marketing strategies for your business
3821,It can be used to test everything from website copy to sales emails to search ads An example of this could be identifying the clickthrough rate for a banner ad
3822,In overfitting a statistical model describes random error or noise instead of the underlying relationship
3823,A model that has been overfit has poor predictive performance as it overreacts to minor fluctuations in the training data
3824,R is more suitable for machine learning than just text analysis
3825,Data Cleaning helps to increase the accuracy of the model in machine learning
3826,It is a cumbersome process because as the number of data sources increases the time taken to clean the data increases exponentially due to the number of sources and the volume of data generated by these sources
3827,It might take up to  of the time for just cleaning data making it a critical part of analysis task
3828,For example the pie charts of sales based on territory involve only one variable and can the analysis can be referred to as univariate analysis
3829,The  bivariate  analysis attempts to understand the difference between two variables at a time as in a scatterplot
3830,For example analyzing the volume of sale and spending can be considered as an example of bivariate analysis
3831,Multivariate analysis  deals with the study of more than two variables to understand the effect of variables on the responses
3832,A researcher wants to survey the academic performance of high school students in Japan
3833,He can divide the entire population of Japan into different clusters cities
3834,Then the researcher selects a number of clusters depending on his research through simple or systematic random sampling
3835,Lets continue our Data Science Interview Questions blog with some more statistics questions
3836,In systematic sampling the list is progressed in a circular manner so once you reach the end of the list it is progressed from the top again
3837,The best example of systematic sampling is equal probability method
3838,In data analysis we usually calculate the eigenvectors for a correlation or covariance matrix
3839,Example   In the medical field assume you have to give chemotherapy to patients
3840,Assume a patient comes to that hospital and he is tested positive for cancer based on the lab prediction but he actually doesnt have cancer
3841,In the absence of cancerous cell chemotherapy will do certain damage to his normal healthy cells and might lead to severe diseases even cancer
3842,They send free voucher mail directly to  customers without any minimum purchase condition because they assume to make at least  profit on sold items above
3843,Due to a shortage of staff they decide to scan passengers being predicted as risk positives by their predictive model
3844,Banks dont want to lose good customers and at the same point in time they dont want to acquire bad customers
3845,In this scenario both the false positives and false negatives become very important to measure
3846,Can you explain the difference between a Validation Set and a Test Set A  Validation   set  can be considered as a part of the training set as it is used for parameter selection and to avoid overfitting of the model being built
3847,On the other hand a  Test Set  is used for testing or evaluating the performance of a trained machine learning model
3848,In simple terms the differences can be summarized as training set is to fit the parameters i
3849,weights and test set is to assess the performance of the model i
3850,The goal of crossvalidation is to term a data set to test the model in the training phase i
3851,The training data consist of a set of training examples
3852,Algorithms Support Vector Machines Regression Naive Bayes Decision Trees Knearest Neighbor Algorithm and Neural Networks E
3853,Algorithms Clustering Anomaly Detection Neural Networks and Latent Variable Models E
3854,In the same example a fruit clustering will categorize as fruits with soft skin and lots of dimples fruits with shiny hard skin and elongated yellow fruits
3855,Logistic Regression often referred as logit model is a technique to predict the binary outcome from a linear combination of predictor variables
3856,For example if you want to predict whether a particular political leader will winthe election or not
3857,In this case the outcome of prediction is binary i
3858,The predictor variables here would be the amount of money spent for election campaigning of a particular candidate the amount of time spent in campaigning etc
3859,Recommender systems are widely used in movies news research articles products social tags music etc
3860,X is referred to as the predictor variable and Y as the criterion variable
3861,An example of collaborative filtering can be to predict the rating of a particular user based on hisher ratings for other movies and others ratings for all movies
3862,If the number of outlier values is few then they can be assessedindividually but for a large number of outliers the values can be substituted with either the th or the st percentile values
3863,To change the value and bring in within a range
3864,Prepare the data for modeling by detecting outliers treating missing values transforming variables etc
3865,After data preparation start running the model analyze the result and tweak the approach
3866,This is an iterative step until the best possible outcome is achieved
3867,Start implementing the model and track the result to analyze the performance of the model over the period of time
3868,If any patterns are identified the analyst has to concentrate on them as it could lead to interesting and meaningful business insights
3869,If there are no patterns identified then the missing values can be substituted with mean or median values imputation or they can simply be ignored
3870,If it is a categorical variable the default value is assigned
3871,If you have a distribution of data coming for normal distribution give the mean value
3872,If  of the values for a variable are missing then you can answer that you would be dropping the variable instead of treating the missing values
3873,The objective of clustering is to group similar entities in a way that the entities within a group are similar to each other but the groups are different from each other
3874,Within Sum of squares is generally used to explain the homogeneity within a cluster
3875,This point is known as the  bending  point and taken as K in K  Means
3876,This is the widely used approach but few data scientists also use Hierarchical clustering first to create dendrograms and identify the distinct groups  from there
3877,Now that we have seen the Machine Learning Questions Lets continue our Data Science Interview Questions blog with some Probability questions
3878,In any minute interval there is a  probability that you will see at least one shooting star
3879,Probability of not seeing any shooting star in the period of one hour
3880,Probability of seeing at least one shooting star in the one hour      P Not seeing any star
3881,There is no way to get seven equal outcomes from a single rolling of a die
3882,If we roll the die twice and consider the event of two rolls we now have  different outcomes
3883,To get our  equal outcomes we have to reduce this  to a number divisible by
3884,We can thus consider only  outcomes and exclude the other one
3885,A simple scenario can be to exclude the combination  i
3886,All the remaining combinations from  till  can be divided into  parts of  each
3887,This way all the seven sets of outcomes are equally likely
3888,From the question we can exclude the first case of BB
3889,Thus from the remaining  possibilities of  BG   GB   BB  we have to find the probability of the case with two girls
3890,One is to pick a fair coin and the other is to pick the one with two heads
3891,Selecting  heads in a row  Selecting fair coin  Getting  heads    Selectingan unfair coin P A
3892,Now although Deep Learning has been around for many years the major breakthroughs from these techniques came just in recent years
3893,This is because of two main reasons The increase in the amount of data generated through various sources The growth in hardware resources required to run these models GPUs are multiple times faster and they help us build bigger and deeper deep learning models in comparatively less time than we required previously
3894,Neural Networks  can adapt to changing input so the network generates the best possible result without needing to redesign the output criteria
3895,Describe the structure of Artificial Neural Networks Artificial Neural Networks works on the same principle as a biological Neural Network
3896,It simply measures the change in all weights with regard to the change in error
3897,You can also think of a gradient as the slope of a function
3898,Gradient Descent  can be thought of climbing down to the bottom of a valley instead of climbing up a hill
3899,This is because it is a minimization algorithm that minimizes a given function  Activation Function
3900,Backpropagation  is a training algorithm used for multilayer neural network
3901,In this method we move the error from an end of the network to all weights inside the network and thus allowing efficient computation of the gradient
3902,It has the following steps Forward Propagation of Training Data Derivatives are computed using output and target Back Propagate for computing derivative of error wrt output activation Using previously calculated derivatives for output Update the Weights
3903,Minibatch Gradient Descent  Its one of the most popular optimization algorithms
3904,Its a variant of Stochastic Gradient Descent and here instead of single training example minibatch of samples is used
3905,An activation function is a function in an artificial neuron that delivers an output based on inputs
3906,This means that we want the output to be as close to input as possible
3907,We add a couple of layers between the input and the output and the sizes of these layers are smaller than the input layer
3908,The Boltzmann machine is basically used to optimize the weights and the quantity for the given problem
3909,The learning algorithm is very slow in networks with many layers of feature detectors
3910,We use these measures to find the central value of the data to summarize the entire data set
3911,The test has a mean score of  and a standard deviation of
3912,Since we are summing up all the values together to get it every value of the data set contributes to its value
3913,Median and mode may or may not change with altering a single value in the dataset
3914,Let A be  B be  C be  and so on
3915,As we can see for a positively skewed curve ModeMedianMean
3916,So if median is  mean would be more than  and mode will be less than
3917,The number of values less than  are    and the number of values greater than  are
3918,A  Only  B Only  C Both  and  D Both  and  Solution C Contrary to the popular belief Bessels correction should not be always done
3919,The bias is definitely reduced as the standard deviation will nowafter correction be depicting the dispersion of the population more than that of the sample
3920,We try to estimate the population variance by dividing the sum of squared difference with the mean with n
3921,A TRUE B FALSE Solution B Below is the formula for standard deviation Since the differences are squared added and then rooted negative standard deviations are not possible
3922,Standard deviation is robust to outliers A True B False Solution B If you look at the formula for standard deviation above a very high or a very low value would increase standard deviation as it would be very different from the mean
3923,A    B    C    D None Solution B From the definition of normal distribution we know that the area under the curve is  for all the  shapes
3924,The curve  is more spread and hence more dispersed most of values being within
3925,Similarly Curve  has a very low range and all the values are in a small range of
3926,Solution A We need to look at the z table for answering this
3927,For a  tailed test and a confidence interval we should check the area before the z value as
3928,since  will be on the left side of the mean and  on the right side
3929,Hence we should check for the z value for area
3930,True or False The standard normal curve is symmetric about  and the total area under it is
3931,ATRUE B FALSE Solution A By the definition of the normal curve the area under it is  and is symmetric about zero
3932,The area to the left of mean is equal to the area on the right of mean
3933,To demonstrate this a researcher obtains a sample of  college students and gives them a standard memory test while they listen to some background music
3934,Under normal circumstances without music the mean score obtained was  and standard deviation is
3935,The mean score for the sample after the experiment i
3936,D Listening to music while studying will not improve memory but can make it worse
3937,Solution D The null hypothesis is generally assumed statement that there is no relationship in the measured phenomena
3938,Here the null hypothesis would be that there is no relationship between listening to music and improvement in memory
3939,C Concluding that listening to music while studying does not improve memory but it does
3940,Here the null hypothesis is that music does not improve memory
3941,BListening to music significantly improves memory at p C The information is insufficient for any conclusion
3942,D None of the above Solution B Lets perform the Z test on the given case
3943,We know that the null hypothesis is that listening to music does not improve memory
3944,Alternate hypothesis is that listening to music does improve memory
3945,The Z score for a sample mean of  from this population is Z critical value for
3946,Therefore since the Z value observed is greater than the Z critical value we can reject the null hypothesis and say that listening to music does improve the memory with  confidence
3947,A researcher concludes from his analysis that a placebo cures AIDS
3948,In this case to define the error we need to first define the null and alternate hypothesis
3949,C Confidence interval will decrease with the introduction of outliers
3950,D We cannot determine the confidence interval in this case
3951,Solution B We know that confidence interval depends on the standard deviation of the data
3952,If we introduce outliers into the data the standard deviation increases and hence the confidence interval also increases
3953,A medical doctor wants to reduce blood sugar level of all his patients byaltering their diet
3954,He finds that the mean sugar level of all patients is  with a standard deviation of
3955,Nine of his patients start dieting and the mean of the sample is observed to
3956,Now he is considering to recommend all his patients to go on a diet
3957,D  Solution B The standard error of the mean is the standard deviation by the square root of the number of values
3958,We can calculate the Z value for the given mean
3959,If we look at the z table the corresponding value for z
3960,Therefore there is around  probability that if everyone starts dieting the population mean would be
3961,B The doctor does not have enough evidence that dieting reduces blood sugar level
3962,C If the doctor makes all future patients diet in a similar way the mean blood pressure will fall below
3963,Solution B  We need to check if we have sufficient evidence to reject the null
3964,The null hypothesis is that dieting has no effect on blood sugar
3965,The z critical value for a  tailed test would be
3966,Since Z value  Z critical value we do not have enough evidence that dieting reduces blood sugar
3967,A researcher is trying to examine the effects of two different teaching methods
3968,After a  minutes lecture of both groups a test is conducted for all the students
3969,We want to calculate if there is a significant difference in the scores of both the groups
3970,Mean test score for group    Mean test score for group    Standard error
3971,D None of the above Solution A The t statistic of the given group is nothing but the difference between the group means by the standard error
3972,Is there a significant difference in the scores of the two groups A Yes B No Solution A The null hypothesis in this case would be that there is no difference between the groups while the alternate hypothesis would be that the groups are significantly different
3973,Since the t statistic is more than the critical value of t we can reject the null hypothesis and say that the two groups are significantly different with  confidence
3974,Solution A The  variability in scores is given by the R   value
3975,The formula for R   given by   R      The degrees of freedom in this case would be   since there are two groups with size  each
3976,The F statistic is given by the ratio of between group variability to within group variability Below is the formula for f Statistic
3977,Since both the numerator and denominator possess square terms F statistic cannot be negative
3978,If x increases y should also increase if x decreases y should also decrease
3979,Now after adding numeric  to all the values of Var the correlation coefficient will  A Increase B Decrease C None of the above Solution C If a constant value is added or subtracted to either variable the correlation coefficient would be unchanged
3980,It is easy to understand if we look at the formula for calculating the correlation
3981,If we add a constant value to all the values of x the x i  and  will change by the same number and the differences will remain the same
3982,It is observed that there is a very high correlation between math test scores and amount of physical exercise done by a student on the test day
3983,High correlation implies that after exercise the test scores are high
3984,Correlation measures the strength of linear relationship between amount of exercise and test scores
3985,A Only  B  and  C  and  D All the statements are true Solution C Though sometimes causation might be intuitive from a high correlation but actually correlation does not imply any causal inference
3986,It just tells us the strength of the relationship between the two variables
3987,If both the variables move together there is a high correlation among them
3988,If the correlation coefficient r between scores in a math test and amount of physical exercise by a student is
3989,This value represents the fraction of the variation in one variable that may be explained by the other variable
3990,If we know one point on the line and the value of slope we can easily find the intercept
3991,B The r squared may increase or decrease while the adjusted r squared always increases
3992,C Both r square and adjusted r square always increase on the introduction of new variables in the model
3993,D Both might increase or decrease depending on the variables introduced
3994,Solution A The R square always increases or at least remains constant because in case of ordinary least squares the sum of square error never increases by adding more variables to the model
3995,The adjusted R squared is a modified version of Rsquared that has been adjusted for the number of predictors in the model
3996,The adjusted Rsquared increases only if the new term improves the model more than would be expected by chance
3997,In a scatter diagram the vertical distance of a point above or below regression line is known as  A Residual B Prediction Error C Prediction D Both A and B E None of the above Solution D The lines as we see in the above plot are the vertical distance of points from the regression line
3998,These are known as the residuals or the prediction error
3999,In univariate linear least squares regression relationship between correlation coefficient and coefficient of determination is   A Both are unrelated False B The coefficient of determination is the coefficient of correlation squared True C The coefficient of determination is the square root of the coefficient of correlation False D Both are same F Solution B The coefficient of determination is the R squared value and it tells us the amount of variability of the dependent variable explained by the independent variable
4000,In case of multivariate regression the r squared value represents the ratio of the sum of explained variance to the sum of total variance
4001,The confidence interval is the range of likely values for a population parameter such as the population mean
4002,For example if you compute a  confidence interval for the average price of an ice cream then you can be  confident that the interval contains the true average cost of all ice creams
4003,The significance level and confidence level are the complementary portions in the normal distribution
4004,True or False Suppose you have been given a variable V along with its mean and median
4005,The line described by the linear regression equation OLS attempts to   A Pass through as many points as possible
4006,B  Pass through as few points as possible C Minimize the number of points it touches D Minimize the squared distance from the points Solution D The regression line attempts to minimize the squared distance between the points and the regression line
4007,By definition the ordinary least squares regression tries to have the minimum sum of squared errors
4008,This means that the sum of squared residuals should be minimized
4009,This may or may not be achieved by passing through the maximum points in the data
4010,We have a linear regression equation  Y  X  for the below table
4011,D None of the above Solution A To calculate the mean absolute error for this case we should first calculate the values of y with the given equation and then calculate the absolute error with respect to the actual values of y
4012,Then the average value of this absolute error would be the mean absolute error
4013,A regression analysis between weight y and height x resulted in the following least squares line y    x
4014,This implies that if the height is increased by  inch the weight is expected to A increase by  pound B increase by  pound C increase by  pound D None of the above Solution  B Looking at the equation given yx
4015,If the height is increased by  unit the weight will increase by  pounds
4016,Since  will be the same in both cases and will go off in the difference
4017,Pearson correlation evaluated the linear relationship between two continuous variables
4018,Having done this it is always good to follow an iterative approach by pulling new data samples and improving the model accordingly by validating it for accuracy by soliciting feedback from the stakeholders of the business
4019,This helps ensure that your model is producing actionable results and improving over the time

4044,Likelihood It is the probability of classifying a given observation as  in the presence of some other variable
4045,in the cases of low bias and high variance LL regularization can help
4046,We may have to tune our model using cross validation and other techniques to overcome over fitting Q
4047,clearly these two columns are in different range and cannot accurately analyse the trend
4048,So we can apply normalization here by using minmax normalization i

4059,if  man is randomly selected his weight is greater than  lb
4060,if  different men are randomly selected their mean weight is greater that lb
4061,In each step the algorithm compares the search key value with the key value of the middle element of the array
4062,If the keys match then a matching element has been found and its index or position is returned
4063,Otherwise if the search key is less than the middle elements key then the algorithm repeats its action on the subarray to the left of the middle element or if the search key is greater on the subarray to the right
4064,Explain Hash Table Answer A hash table is a data structure used to implement an associative array a structure that can map keys to values
4065,Explain Central Limit Theorem Answer As the sample size increases the sampling distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution
4066,If all possible random samples of size n are selected from a population with mean  and standard deviation  the mean of the sample means is denoted by   x  so   x   the standard deviation of the sample means is   x     n Question
4067,In linear regression models of the unknown parameters are estimated from the data using linear functions
4068,Give An Example Of Inferential Statistics Answer Example of Inferential Statistic  You asked five of your classmates about their height
4069,On the basis of this information you stated that the average height of all students in your university or college is  inches
4070,Given a Dataset Analyze this dataset and give me a model that can predict this response variable
4071,Start by fitting a simple model multivariate regression logistic regression do some feature engineering accordingly and then try some complicated models
4072,Always split the dataset into train validation test dataset and use cross validation to check their performance
4073,Determine if the problem is classification or regression Favor simple models that run quickly and you can easily explain
4074,Mention cross validation as a means to evaluate the model
4075,This should be mitigated by repeated splitting of train vs test dataset as in cross validation
4076,If the train and test data has a different distribution then the classifier would likely overfit to the train data
4077,This issue can be overcome by using a more general learning method
4078,concept shift The causes can be Training samples are obtained in a biased way
4079,sample selection bias Train is different from test because of temporal spatial changes
4080,nonstationary environments Solution to covariate shift importance weighted cv Q
4081,Changes to the algorithm Use treebased methods instead of regression methods as they are more resistant to outliers
4082,For statistical tests use non parametric tests instead of parametric ones
4083,Use robust error metrics such as MAE or Huber Loss instead of MSE
4084,Changes to the data Winsorizing the data Transforming the data e
4085,log Remove them only if youre certain theyre anomalies not worth predicting Q
4086,MAE is more robust in that sense but is harder to fit the model for because it cannot be numerically optimized
4087,MSE easier to compute the gradient MAE linear programming needed to compute the gradient MAE more robust to outliers
4088,If the consequences of large errors are great use MSE MSE corresponds to maximizing likelihood of Gaussian random variables Q
4089,Some metrics like AUC is only applicable in the binary case
4090,So the algorithm can be used in text categorization  conditional independence of every other feature should be met Tree Ensembles good for large N and large P can deal with categorical features very well non parametric so no need to worry about outliers GBTs work better but the parameters are harder to tune RF works out of the box but usually performs worse than GBT Deep Learning works well for some classification tasks e

4094,Build a regression function to estimate the number of retweets as a function of time t to determine if one regression function can be built see if there are clusters in terms of the trends in the number of retweets if not we have to add features to the regression function features   of retweets on the first and the second day  predict the seventh day  Q
4095,Then for example for twitter we can construct features from each tweet e
4096,the tweeted date number of favorites retweets and of course the features created from the tweeted content itself
4097,Then use a multi variate time series model to predict the weather
4098,To be more accurate we can build a content based filtering or collaborative filtering
4099,If theres enough user usage data we can try collaborative filtering and recommend contents other similar users have consumed
4100,If there isnt we can recommend similar items based on vectorization of items content based filtering

4119,A lazy high school senior types up application and envelopes to n different colleges but puts the applications randomly into the envelopes
4120,If the first time I get heads is on the nth coin then I pay you n dollars
4121,You randomly pick coin and flip it twice and get heads both times
4122,Lets say youre building the recommended music engine at Spotify to recommend peoplemusic based on past lis tening history
4123,variance explained by the regression  total variance the more predictors you add the higher R becomes
4124,For example to cover a fraction of the volume of the data we need to capture a very wide range for each variable as the number of variables increases All samples are close to the edge of the sample
4125,And this is a bad news because prediction is much more difficult near the edges of the training sample
4126,The sampling density decreases exponentially as p increases and hence the data becomes much more sparse without significantly more data
4127,Is more data always better Statistically It depends on the quality of your data for example if your data is biased just getting more data wont help
4128,If your model suffers from high bias getting more data wont improve your test results beyond a point
4129,Practically Also theres a tradeoff between having more data and the additional storage computational power memory it requires
4130,Hence always think about the cost of having more data
4131,You wont find them all but you might find some
4132,Variables can be multimodal If a variable is multimodal then anything based on its mean or median is going to be suspect
4133,The exploratory phase will generate lots of possible hypotheses and the exploitatory phase will let you really understand a few of them
4134,Balance the two and youll prevent yourself from wasting time on many things that end up meaningless although not all
4135,The scientific method is eminently inductive we elaborate a hypothesis test it and refute it or not
4136,Look at the variables added in forward variable selection Q
4137,Use a model that can incorporate missing data  Like a random forest or any treebased method
4138,You have several variables that are positively correlated with your response and you thinkcombining all of the variables could give you a good prediction of your response
4139,Lets say youre given an unfeasible amount of predictors in a predictive modeling task
4140,Now you have a feasible amount of predictors but youre fairly sure that you dont need all of them
4141,You retain only the best features according to the test outcome scores Recursive Feature Elimination First train a model with all the feature and evaluate its performance on held out data
4142,the feature with least absolute coefficients in a linear model and retrain on the remaining features
4143,Iterate until you observe a sharp drop in the predictive accuracy of the model
4144,Your linear regression didnt run and communicates that there are an infinite number of best estimates for the regression coefficients
4145,If some of the explanatory variables are perfectly correlated positively or negatively then the coefficients would not be unique
4146,You run your regression on different subsets of your data and that in each subset the betavalue for a certain variable varies wildly
4147,Hence the combined model is expected to perform better than an individual model
4148,Assumptions average out biases reduce variance Bagging works because some underlying learning algorithms are unstable slightly different inputs leads to very different outputs
4149,By reweighting examples near the margin the positive and negative examples you get a reduced error see  Use the outputs of your models as inputs to a metamodel
4150,For example if youre doing binary classification you can use all the probability outputs of your individual models as inputs to a final logistic regression or any model really that can combine the probability estimates
4151,One very important point is to make sure that the output of your models are out ofsample predictions
4152,This means that the predicted value for any row in your dataframe should NOT depend on the actual value for that row
4153,We assume that the probability that a user solves a problem only depends on the skill of the user and the difficulty of the problem
4154,Then we maximize the likelihood of the data to find the hidden skill and difficulty levels
4155,You have  people that rank  sushis in terms of salt iness
4156,If I wanted something simple I would use the median since ranks are strictly speaking ordinal and not interval so adding them is a bit risque but people do it all the time and you probably wont be far wrong
4157,you have your votes and we can calculate the similarity for each representatives and select the most similar representative for liberal and republican parties find the mean vector and find the representative closest to the center point Q

4159,You have data on all purchases of customers at a grocery store
4160,More rigorously we can conduct a permutation test to see if the distributions are the same
4161,Ways to attempt to correct for this include changing your confidence level e
4162,Bonferroni Correction or doing familywide tests before you dive in to the individual metrics e
4163,I have two different experiments that both change the signup button to my website
4164,You are AirBnB and you want to test the hypothesis that a greater number of photographs increases the chances that a buyer selects the listing
4165,maximum likelihood estimation MLE is a method of estimating the parameters of a statistical model given observations by finding the parameter values that maximize the likelihood of making the observations given the parameters
4166,MOM has not used much anymore because maximum likelihood estimators have higher probability of being close to the quantities to be estimated and are more often unbiased
4167,if confidence intervals are constructed using a given confidence level in an infinite number of independent experiments the proportion of those intervals that contain the true value of the parameter will match the confidence level
4168,This is desirable in inference because the goal is to explain the dataset as accurately as possible
4169,We sometimes want to prioritize the generalizability and avoid overfitting by reducing variance and thus increasing bias
4170,Ex  If you sent a marketing survey link to  people through email and only  participated in the survey then  is the sample survey and  is the sample
4171,Interpolation is the estimation of missing past values within two values in a sequence of values Q

4173,Regression ClassificationUnsupervised learning no output is given and the algorithm is made to learn the outcomes implicity Ex
4174,Difference between bias and variance tradeoff High Bias is an underlying error wrong assumption that makes the model to underfit
4175,Typically we would like to have a model with low bias and low variance Q
4176,t to number of clusters Gap Statistic Silhouette method Q
4177,It is also known to represent cause and effect Causation means there is correlation but correlation doesnt necessarily mean causation Q
4178,Explain normal distribution Normal distribution is a bell shaped curve that represents distribution of data around its mean

4195,Joseph Michael Montgolfier  French InventorAeronaut  EEP lea rning interviews are technical dense and thanks to the fields competitiveness often highstakes
4196,The prospect of preparing for one can be daunting  and the fear of failure can be paralyzing and many interviewees find their ideas slipping away alongside their confidence
4197,This boo k was written for you an aspiring data scientist with a quantitative background fac ing down the gauntlet of the interview process in an increasingly competitive fiel d
4198,For most of you the interview process is the most significant hurdle between you and a dream job
4199,Though this book is highly te chnical it is not too dense to work through quickly
4200,It aims to be comprehensive including many of the  terms and topics involved in modern data scienc e and deep learning
4201,That thor oughness makes it unique no other single work of fers such breadth of lea rning tar geted so specifically at the demands of the interview
4202,Most comparab le information is available in a variety of form ats locations structures and resourcesblog po sts tech articles and short boo ks scattered across the internet
4203,Those resources a re simply not adequate to the  demands of deep learning interview or exam preparation and were not assembled with this explicit purpose in mind
4204,It is hoped that this book does not suf fer the same shortcomings
4205,HIS boo ks creation was guided by a few key principles clarity and depth thoroughness and precision interest and accuracy
4206,The book will still be of use to other readers such as those still under going their initial education in a STEM field
4207,The boo ks conte nts are a lar ge inventory of numerous topics re levant to deep learning job interviews and gr aduate level exams
4208,Ideas that are interesting or pertinent have been excluded if they are not valuable in that context
4209,That places this work at the  forefront of th e growing trend in education and in business to emphasize a core set of practical mathematical and computational skills
4210,It is now widely understo od that the training of every computer scientist must include a course d ealing with the fundamental theorems of machine learning in a rigorous manner Deep Learning appears  in the curriculum of nearly every university and this volu me is designed as a co nvenient ongoing reference for  graduates of such courses and programs
4211,The boo k is grounded in both academic expertise and onthe job experience and thus  has two goals
4212,First it compresses all of the necessary information into a coherent package
4213,And second it renders that information accessible and makes it easy to navigate
4214,As a result the book helps the reader develop a thorough understanding of the principles and concepts underlying practical data science
4215,A text that is rigor ous  and builds a solid understanding of the subject w getting bogged down in too many technicalities
4216,There  are in connections between calculus logistic regression entropy  and deep le theory  w hich I feel need to be emphasized and elucidated if the reader is t understand the field
4217,Dif ferences in notation and presentation style in e sources make it very dif ficult for students to appreciate these kinds of conne
4218,I t is very useful to have a text compact enough that all material in it can be covered in few weeks or months of intensive review candidates will have only that m uch time to prepare for an interview  so a text is of no use to them
4219,The text that follows is an attempt to meet all of the above challenges
4220,It will inevitably prove  more successful at handling some of them than others but it has at least made a sincere and devoted ef fort
4221,A note about Bibliography The boo k provid es a carefully cu rated bibliography to guide further study  whether for i nterview preparation or sim ply as a matter of interest or job relevant research
4222,A comprehensive bibliography would be far too long to include here and would be of li ttle immediate use so the se lections have been made with d eliberate attention to the value of each included text
4223,Only the  most important books and articles on each topic have been included and only those w ritten in English that I personally consulted

5505,In or der to normalize we i Step one is to subtract the mean to shift the distribution
5506,ii Divide a ll the shifted values by their standar d deviation the squar e r oot of the variance
5507,In BN the normalization is applied on an element by element basis
5508,During training at each epoch every element in the batch has  to be shifted and scaled so that it has a zer o mean and unit variance within the batch

5510,The mistake he made is using a BN with a batch size of  while the output fr om the convolutional layer is
5511,All the options may be used to build a CNN
5512,While the original paper     s uggests that BN layers be used  before  an activation function it is also possible to  use BN after the activation function
5513,In some cases it actua lly leads to better r esults
5514,Of course during infer ence no dr opout is taking place at all
5515,Reducing and then incr easing the activations may for ce the MLP to learn a mor e compr essed r epr esentation
5516,The ne w ar ch itectur e has far mor e connections and ther efor e it would be pr one to over fitting
5517,The question states that image size is quite lar ge and the batch size is  ther efor e it may fail to allocate memory on the GPU  with an Out Of Memory OOM err or message
5518,One way would be to amend the  splitting is by first keeping a fraction of the training set aside for instance
5519,His new appr oach uses GridS ear chCV with fold cr oss validation to tune his Hyper parameters
5520,Since he is using cr oss va lidation with five folds his local CV metrics would better r eflect the performance on an unseen data set
5521,In  grid search   a set of pr edetermined values is selected by a user for eac h dimension in his sear ch space and then thor oughly attempting each and every combination
5522,Naturally  with suc h a lar ge sear ch spac e the number of the r equir ed combinations that need to be evaluated scale exponentially in the number of dimensions in the grid sear ch
5523,In  random search  the m ain differ ence is that the a lgorithm samples completely random points for each of the dimensions in th e sear ch sp ace
5524,Random sear ch is usually faster and may even pr oduce better r esults
5525,Labelling and bias Recommended reading  Added value of double r eading in diagnostic radiology  a systematic r eview
5526,Ther e is a poten tial for bias in certain settings such as this
5527,Even if we use theform of radiolo gy r eport r eading known as double r eading it would not be necessarily true t hat the annotated scans would be devoid of bias or that the quality would be better
5528,A validation curve displays on  a single graph a chosen hyperparameter on the horizontal axis and a chosen metric on the vertical axis
5529,Accuracy  err or  accuracy or loss ar e typical quality metrics
5530,The longer the network is trained the better it gets on the training set
5531,At some point the network is fit too well to the training data and loses its cap ability to generalize
5532,While the classifier is still imp r oving on the training set it gets worse on the validation and the test set
5533,At th is point the quality curve of the training set and the validation set diver ge
5534,Ther e possible methods ar e i Constant ii XavierGlor ot uniform iii XavierGlor ot normal
5535,Good initializat ion would optimally generate activations that pr o duce initial gradients that ar e lar ger than zer o
5536,One idea is that the training pr oce ss would conver ge faster if unit variance is achieved
5537,Mor eover  weights should be selected car efully so that i They ar e lar ge enough thus pr eventing gradients fr om decaying to zer o
5538,ii They ar e not too lar ge causing activation functions to over saturate
5539,Ther e ar e several ways to r educe the pr oblem of plateaus i Add some type of r egularization
5540,ii In cases wher ein the plateau happens right at the beginning amend the way weights ar e initialized
5541,iii Amending the optimization algorithm altogether  for instance using SGD instead of Adam and vice versa
5542,Since the initial LR is alr eady very low  his suggestion may worsen the situation since the optimiser would not be able to jump off and escape the plateau
5543,In contr ast to accuracy  Log los s has no upper bounds and ther efor e at times may be mor e d ifficult to understand and to explain
5544,Usually data augmentation is a technique that is heavily used du ring tra ining especially for incr easing the number of instances of minority classes
5545,In this case augmentations ar e using during infer ence and this method is entitled T est T ime Augmentation TT A
5546,Ther e is  no r elation to random number generation the true meaning is the use of batches during the training pr ocess
5547,A lar ger batch size decr eases t he variance of the gradient estimation of SGD
5548,Ther efor e if your training loop uses lar ger batches the model will conver ge faster
5549,On the other hand smaller  batch sizes incr ease the variance leading to the opposite phenomena longer conver gence times
5550,The derivative of the logistic activation function is extr emely small for either negtive or positive lar ge inputs
5551,The use of the t anh function does not alleviate the pr oblem since we can sc ale and translate the sigmoid function to r epr esent the tanh function While the sigmoid function is c entr ed ar ound
5552,the tanh activation is centr ed ar ound zer o
5553,Similar to the application of BN centring the activations may aid the optimizer conver ge faster
5554,In stochastic gradient descent the gradient for a single sample is  quite  differ ent  fr om the actual gradient so this gives a mor e  noisy  value and conver ges  slower iii T rue
5555,The Manhattan distance is an L norm intr oduced by Hermann Minkowski while the Euclidean distance is an L norm
5556,Note that we ar e allocating tensors on a GPU b ut first they ar e cr eated on a CPU using numpy
5557,Note that this only wor k if you have GPU ava ilable in case ther e is no GPU detected the code has a fallback to the CPU
5558,device cuda  if  usecuda else  cpu    print  device  xnp   numpy
5559,The L loss is suitable for a tar get or a r esponse variable that is continuous
5560,On the other hand in a binary classification pr oblem using LR we would like the output to match either zer o or o ne a nd a natural candidate for a loss function is the binary cr ossentr opy loss

5775,I wantedto strip back the outer cover and see the machinery within
5776,And theanswers to such ageold questions are closer at hand than at any point in history
5777,While I do not believe we will ever fully understand the extraordinary mystery of thehuman mind we certainly can learnand have learneda tremendous amount about our mental processes
5778,Moreover such discoveries can help reduce the sufferingand improve the lives of millions of people
5779,Interestingly the major players in the field of psychology used to be far better known to the general public
5780,Fifty years ago the average person on the street wasmore likely to be familiar with the likes of Sigmund Freud B
5781,There was a widespread appreciation of the importance of the field of psychology and its relevance to everyday life
5782,In contemporary times there is far less generalawareness of the contributions of the field of psychology
5783,Perhaps psychologythat isthe scientific discipline of psychologyhas been a victim of its own success
5784,But I would suggest that the entertainment value of popular psychology has overtaken the appreciation of serious science
5785,Psychology remains an incredibly popular major in college and graduate school
5786,But within theuniversity the seriousness of the field has overtaken its inherent entertainment value
5787,This book is intended to find a middle ground to provide a rigorous and scientifi cally grounded book that is nonetheless accessible and engaging to the general public
5788,The first section of this book gives an overview of the fundamentals of psychology
5789,We cover the history and pioneers of psychology the major theoretical movements thescience of psychology the brain and its relationship to behavior and psychologicaldevelopment across the lifespan
5790,Chapter  addresses clinical psychology covering such topics aspsychopathology psychiatric diagnosis psychotherapy and psychiatric medication
5791,As part of the Handy Answer Book series this book is structured in a question andanswer format
5792,The goal is to break down complex topics into bitesize ideas
5793,While the questions were carefully selected to create a narrative flow this is also thekind of book that you can open at any point and browse
5794,If you want you can read thebook from cover to cover but you can also flip through to find questions that particularly jump out at you
5795,Although I want the reader to feel free to jump around the nature of science is that it is cumulative
5796,In other words the most recent developments rest upon theshoulders of earlier work
5797,Because of this the sections in the second half of the bookwill sometimes refer to topics and people introduced in the first half
5798,While this practice is necessary for scientific accuracy it does notmake for easy reading
5799,Therefore we put the reference list at the back of the book
5800,viiiHandy Psychology     PM  Page viiiThis book is intended for the general public
5801,Although this book is intended for the general public it can also be used to sup plement traditional textbooks
5802,If you want a quick review on Attachment Theory or onBehaviorism if you want to remind yourself of the basics of brainbehavior relationships or if you want a quick introduction to key psychological theories this book canbe helpful for you
5803,ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Many people contributed to the writing of this book
5804,IgorGalynker Nancy Maruyama and the Division of Biological Psychiatry for their continual and extremely helpful feedback on various chapters
5805,RaminMojtabai Alessandra Strada and Ed DAngelo for their comments on the accuracy orlack thereof of sections on neurobiology humanistic psychology and classicalthought
5806,I would also like to acknowledge Vanessa and David Evans Alex and JoshCohen David and Marina Vergara Julie Cohen Evans Katia Segre Cohen and SylviaCohen for their insights into adolescent slang past and present and into the mysterious world of childrens thought
5807,Thanks as well to Dennis Mack for creative ideas aswell as legal advice

5824,Wilhelm Wundt  is credited with first establishing psychology as an independent science
5825,He opened the first scientific laboratory to study psychology in  at the University of Leipzig
5826,Wundt was interestedin investigating human consciousness through systematic introspection collaborators would be trained to report their own sensory experience in response to physical stimulation
5827,Without the systematicapplication of reason and observation that forms the foundation of the scientificmethod there would be no modern psychology
5828,Nonetheless contemporary psychology is not without precedents and within Western history there are many precursorsancestors so to speak of psychology as we know it today
5829,It is important to note though that the Greeks conception of the mind was quite different from ours
5830,In general the Greeks understood the mind in more concrete ways with less emphasis on the complexity of subjective experience
5831,Did Homer have a Concept of the Mind Homers legendary epics the Iliad and the Odyssey date back to the eighth century B
5832,Although Homers epics are timeless stories of passion and drama his under standing of human psychology is radically different from our view today
5833,There is noreal concept of consciousness in Homer no sense of the characters behaviors beingmotivated by their own internal feelings or thoughts
5834,Instead characters motivations are imposed on them through the whims of the gods
5835,Abstract ideas of mental life of consciousness do not exist andawareness is understood in concrete bodily terms
5836,Philosophers such as Alcmaeon Protagoras Democritus and Hippocrates introduced concepts remarkably pertinent to modernideas
5837,Several ofthese philosophers believed that our knowledge of the world is only learned throughthe sense organs
5838,Thisbelief in the relativism of human knowledge is a radical idea that remains pertinent tomodern psychology
5839,Do all the ancient Greeks ideas hold up in the light of modern science Not all of the ancient Greeks ideas make sense from a contemporary point of view
5840,Hippocrates for example believed that mental illness is caused by imbalancesbetween bile phlegm and blood and Alcmaeon believed that perceptions reached thebrain through channels of air
5841,Nonetheless the attempt to find biological explanationsof psychological processes is extraordinarily similar to modern views
5842,Hippocrates based his physiological theory on the ideas of another preSocratic philosopher Empedocles c
5843,Thebodily elements of black bile yellow bile blood and phlegm corresponded witheach of Empedocless four elements
5844,Although Hippocrates attributed all mentalprocesses such as joy grief etc
5845,to the brain he believed that both mental andphysical health rested on a harmonious balance of the four bodily humors
5846,expanded Hip pocratess ideas to create a typology of personality
5847,The melancholic personalityfrom black bile tended toward the depressed the choleric from yellow biletended toward anger the sanguine from blood tended toward the vigorouscourageous and amorous and the phlegmatic from phlegm tended to be calmand not easily perturbed
5848,Each personality type resulted from an excess of itsrespective bodily humor
5849,Although modern science has disproved this theoryGalens terms are still used to describe personality traits
5850,the two most famous Greek philosophers have had farreaching influence on Western thought
5851,While neither isbest known for his psychological ideas both have had impact on Western conceptionsof the mind
5852,Plato believed that the truth lay in abstract concepts or forms that couldbe grasped through reason alone
5853,The data we get from our senses is impermanentand therefore illusory
5854,The notion of an inborn mental ability to grasp concepts andcategories is consistent with modern cognitive psychology and neurosciencealthough the dismissal of sense data is not
5855,Aristotle was much more enamored ofthe natural world and believed knowledge to come from systematic logical reasoningabout our observations of nature
5856,He maintained that the capacity for logical reasoning is innate but the content of our knowledge can only be grasped through our senses
5857,In this way Aristotle anticipated the foundations of modern science

5862,As humanbeings are the only animals that reason it is our telos to reason it is ourpurpose
5863,If we live according to ourpurpose we will be living virtuouslyand will consequently be happy
5864,There are two types of telos intrinsic telos and extrinsic telos
5865,Intrinsic telos suggests that the aim ofthe organism is inherent in its naturean acorn is innately programmed togrown into a tree
5866,Extrinsic telosrefers to a purpose imposed by anexternal force such as a deity
5867,In the Darwinian view of natural selection genetic variations happen by chance and persist only if they turn out to be adaptive if they promote the survival of the species
5868,We reason not because it is our telos but because we happen to have evolved that way
5869,The teleological view is more consistent with other modern views though
5870,Sigmund Freud as well may have been influenced by teleology

5872,INTRODUCING THE BASICS the bodily passions in order to turn ones desire toward loftier goals as described in his metaphor of the soul as a charioteer with a pair of winged steeds
5873,One steed is immortallike the steeds of the gods and aspires toward contemplation of spiritual beauty
5874,Theother steed is mortal and plunges toward earth and toward animalistic passions anddesire
5875,The chariot must rein in the steed of animal appetites in order for the soul togain true happiness
5876,We can link the earthly steed to the id and the charioteer to theego
5877,More loosely we could tie the immortal steed to the superego
5878,Handy Psychology     PM  Page Did the Roman statesman Cicero have anything to add about the mind The Romans were better known for their practical accomplishments in the fields of law engineering and warfare than for their philosophical works but some contributions are worth noting
5879,the famous Roman orator gave a detailed description of the passions
5880,He grouped the passions into four categories discomfort fear pleasure or joy and desire libido in Latin
5881,We can wonder whether Freuds use of the term libido was influenced by Cicero
5882,By then Chris tianity was the official religion of the Roman Empire and following the fall of Romethe Christian church was essentially the sole surviving institution
5883,Although manyaspects of pagan philosophical thought were integrated into church teaching e
5884,Platos idea of the immortal soul anything that did not fit with Christian theologywas considered heretical
5885,In Christendom meaning most of Europe this state ofaffairs remained largely unchanged until the dawn of the modern era
5886,True happiness would only be found in Heaven not on earth and  It was once common in Europe for people to believe that mental illnesses were the result of possession by devils and demons
5887,In the Middle Ages Satan was often blamed for most of the suffering in the world

5890,Every individual has the free will to choose whether or not to fol low God
5891,Sex and the passions of the body were considered sinful unless performedwithin a marriage for the purpose of childbearing
5892,Belief in the devil was also widespread and mental illness was often seen as a result of possession by the devil
5893,Despite a traumatically peripatetic life Avicenna succeeded in writing one of the most influential texts in the history of medicine known as the Canon of Medicine
5894,He endorsed the doctrineof the four humors in the tradition of Hippocrates and Galen as well as the brains rolein psychological disturbances
5895,His theory about inner senses addressed the relationships between perception memory and imagination
5896,Mental illness in particular was seen to be causedby demonic possession
5897,It was believed that Jesus exorcised demons a task thatwas performed by priests by the time of the Middle Ages
5898,Philosophers of note includedRen Descartes  Benedict de Spinoza  Thomas Hobbes and John Locke
5899,His famous phrase Cogito ergo sum I think therefore I am links the mental function of thinking to the proof of his very existence
5900,In fact Cartesian dualism the notion that the mind and the body are separate entities continues to inspire debate to this day
5901,waterbasedmechanics of the day Descartes had a complex mechanical understanding of mentaland physical processes that anticipated Freuds own hydraulic model
5902,Descartes wrotethat impressions of the outside world are made on our sensory organs i
5903,eyes earsnose causing animal spirits a life giving fluid filled with purified blood to press onour brain
5904,The brain then sends the fluid down to our body through our nerves causing muscles to expand and move
5905,In this way critical functions like digestion respiration and even psychological processes such as sensation the appetites and passionstake place
5906,Spinoza believed our primary psychological drive to be the promotion and protection of our own wellbeing and survival an idea that anticipated evolutionary psychology
5907,Finally Spinoza taught that our cognitive appraisal of any situation will determine our emotional response
5908,This is the basic principle behind cognitive therapy pioneeredin the mid twentieth century by Aaron Beck and Albert Ellis
5909,As the issues of psychology are so relevant to everyday life we would expect many people to come up with ideas about psychological principles
5910,Folk psychology often expressed in aphorisms or proverbs captures some of these ideas asthey were passed down through the generations
5911,Below are just some of thecommon sense sayings that people have used over the years to communicate thewisdom of folk psychology
5912,This concept of associative memory became the basis of behaviorism a psy chological movement that arose in the twentieth century
5913,Further he considered our complex ideas abstract concepts such as justice love whiteness to derive from combinations of simple ideas
5914,Thenotion that cognition develops from the simple to the complex anticipates Piaget andother twentieth century cognitive psychologists
5915,Nonetheless throughout historyand across cultures people have grappled with these questions and come up withtheir own answers
5916,In order to travel to the domain of thespirits they enter a trancelike state often by dancing music or a psychoactive plant
5917,Shamanism is a widely spread practice ranging from the Mongolian steppes to indigenous people of the Americas
5918,While shamanistic practices will vary across cultures inall shamanistic societies it is presumed that the world is peopled by spirits and thatproper ceremonial communion with these spirits will heal mental and physical illnessbring favorable weather conditions regulate social harmony etc
5919,There is an emphasison the ecstatic trance state as a condition of personal transformation
5920,Moreover anindividuals internal mental states are seen to be caused byor at least subject tooutside forces such as the spirits of ancestors animals or aspects of nature
5921,There area number of religious traditions in Asiamany going back thousands of years
5922,Buddhism and Hinduism are the largest andbest known of the Eastern religions
5923,Meditation and other contemplative practices are the best ways to access the spiritual knowledge that lies within all of us
5924,Althoughthere is tremendous variation in Hinduism there are some consistent strains
5925,The manydeities in Hinduism are simply manifestations of this cosmic divinity
5926,Suffering comesfrom ignorance and enlightenment comes from knowledge of the oneness of all realityand of the illusory nature of separateness and individuality
5927,These ideas are consistent with Western psychological theories INTRODUCING THE BASICS A mask from Papua New Guinea similar to the kind used by shamans
5928,Contemplative practices have also been explicitly integrated into contemporary psychotherapies suchas Mindfulness Training and Dialectical Behavioral Therapy
5929,Thus in all three religions human psychology isdefined and shaped by the relationship to God
5930,Happiness is found by getting close toGod by submitting to or obeying Him and living according to His dictates
5931,Finallytruth is revealed by God either through the central religious texts or through prayer
5932,There may be variation in the interpretation of Gods truth but His truth is absolutethere is no truth outside of it
5933,Much more was known about the nervous systemthe brain and the chemical and electrical processes in the body than could have beendreamed of by the earlier philosophers
5934,The scientific method had continued to evolveand technology allowed for sophisticated instruments of measurement
5935,Ernst Weber  Hermann Helmholtz  and GustavFechner  had all made important contributions to our understanding ofsensation and perception prior to this but none of them considered himself a psychologist per se
5936,Wundt in contrast was specifically focused upon establishing psychology as a science
5937,Phrenology was started by Franz Joseph Gall  inthe beginning of the nineteenthcentury
5938,Gall believed that specificpsychological traits could be localized to specific parts of the brain
5939,Consequently careful examination of theshape of the skull could reveal thepersons psychological profile
5940,he measured the skulls of hundreds of people but his biased methodsallowed him to pick and choose hisfindings to fit his theories
5941,Phrenology became very popular over the next century and phrenology busts were quite common
5942,Phrenology only fell out of favorin the twentieth century after modern science advanced enough to prove itwrong
5943,As with eugenics it was sometimes used to justify racist and sociallyprejudiced theories
5944,Similarly it was adopted by the Nazis to prove Aryansupremacy
5945,istockINTRODUCING THE BASICS Interested in the nature of sensation he combined objective measures with rigor ously trained introspection
5946,Researchers were taught to carefully monitor their own perceptual and sensory experience
5947,Wundts focus was on mapping the mechanics ofsensation with mathematical precision
5948,He also taught hundreds of students and wasresponsible for training many of the major figures in the first few decades of the field
5949,His focus on identifying the components of the mind was termed structuralism
5950,Hired by Harvard in  as a professor of physiology he took on the new title of professor of psychology in
5951,Like Wundt he was an avid promoter of the new field ofpsychology
5952,Although his interests eventually took him far beyondpsychology his publication Principles of Psychology had a long and powerful influ ence on the development of the field
5953,Although he ran his own lab using similar methodology hefelt that the psychophysiology practiced by Wundt and others focused only on the smallest and ultimately least interesting of mental phenomena
5954,He was alsomore interested in holistic concerns such as the meaning and continuity of the self
5955,atomistic approach marks a theme that per sists throughout the history of psychology as well as the natural sciences in general
5956,In fact later in hiscareer James abandoned psychology for a school of philosophy called pragmatism
5957,Is intelligence passed on in families much like height or hair color That his own family tree was filled with gifted intel Handy Psychology     PM  Page lectuals is probably relevant to his choice of study
5958,He was a child prodigy and wasthe grandson of Erasmus Darwin a notedphysician and botanist and a first cousinof Charles Darwin
5959,For example very tall parents willoften have less tall children
5960,He wanted toapply it to social policy so that only families with high intelligence would breed and theless fortunate would be discouraged from reproducing
5961,These ideas were expressed inseveral books and later spread to numerous academic departments and internationalsocieties
5962,The fact that he greatly discounted the impact of environment on intellectualdevelopment specifically the effect of social class racial discrimination and access toeducation inevitably set the stage for prejudicial and racist applications of this theory
5963,Moral questions regarding the civil rights of the genetically less fit were also neglected
5964,Eugenics had significant impact on American immigration policies in the sjustifying the restriction of Eastern and Southern European immigrants
5965,Eugenics fellout of favor after the Nazis championed it in support of their genocidal policies

5967,Psychiatry came into its own as a distinct medical field in the early nineteenth century
5968,He saw manic depression as a milder form of illness with a more optimistic prognosis
5969,In contrast dementia praecox was seen as a progressively deteriorating illnesswith little hope of cure
5970,Of course there were no medicines available in the nineteenthcentury to effectively treat these conditions
5971,The Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler  was the director of the renowned Burghlzli psychiatric hospital
5972,Bleuler coined the term schizophrenia from the Greek words for split mind
5973,Although Galltried to ground his theories in the scientific measurement of skulls he let hispreconceptions shape his collection and analysis of the data
5974,Later proponents of phrenology tried to use it to justify ethnic and class dis crimination
5975,Likewise Herbert Spencer  a proponent of Social Darwinism interpreted Darwins theory of natural selection as a justification for socialinequality
5976,Thefirst intelligence tests were full of socially biased items that unfairly favoredaffluent Americanborn English speakers over poor uneducated immigrantsand nonwhite minorities
5977,While psychological science has developed moresophisticated methodology to minimize the effect of experimenter bias of anykind it is important to realize that as long as science is conducted by humanbeings it is subject to human error
5978,He also introduced the term autism to describe the schizophrenics withdrawal from the outer world
5979,As the inventor of psychoanalysis heintroduced concepts of the unconscious the impact of childhood repressed emotionsand even the entire field of psychotherapy to the wider world
5980,While aspects of his theories remain controversial much of his work has become such an integral part of ourculture that it is taken for granted
5981,As a physician he tended to the sick thus he developed his theories of themind through investigations of psychopathology
5982,Although it is difficult to neatly summarize his ideas because they changed andevolved over more than four decades ofwork there are several key concepts
5983,Theseinclude the dynamic unconscious theinstincts of libido and aggression orThanatos and the importance of childhood conflicts on adult psychopathologyand even personality
5984,Moreover unacceptable wishes and impulses would be pushed backinto the unconscious to protect the person from anxiety
5985,Handy Psychology     PM  Page out of awareness but rather come back to do mischief generally in disguised form
5986,These partially expressed impulses formed the symptoms that psychoanalysis wasdesigned to cure
5987,Libido defined as sexuality although more accurately thought of as broad sensualpleasure was his primary focus
5988,He added the death instinct Thanatos after livingthrough the carnage of World War I
5989,In later years Thanatos was frequently interpreted as the aggressive drive
5990,Freud asserted that an instinct functions like an electricalcharge that needs to be expressed through behavior
5991,Because the instinct still presses forexpression much like water rushing downhill it will be displaced into another channel of expression resulting in a symptom such as an obsession compulsion or a hysterical complaint a physical symptom without any true physical cause
5992,His fluidlikeconception of the instincts was later referred to as the hydraulic model
5993,While this theory may appear odd from todays point of view it is easy to see that he was attempting to fit his observations of his patients behavior into the scientificmodels of his day
5994,His theory of the psychosexualstages included the oral anal phallic and genital stages
5995,For example the anal stage was characterized by stinginess concern with money andor wish for control
5996,If the child was eitherundergratified or overgratified in any stage the child could fixate at that stagebecoming in effect psychologically stuck
5997,For example obsessions and compulsions reflected regression to the anal stage
5998,WhileFreuds instinctual theory has been much criticized the notion that developmentalproblems at any point in childhood can hinder later development and result in adultpsychopathology must be seen as one of Freuds greatest contributions
5999,For one he brought to light the wayunconscious passions can rule our livesthe battle between animalistic passions and Handy Psychology     PM  Page the constraints of civilization
6000,His particular emphasis on sexuality opened discussion on a formerly taboo subject
6001,Secondly he drew attention to the effect of childhoodexperiences and trauma on adult emotional adjustment
6002,Thirdly his invention of themethod of psychoanalysis spearheaded the entire discipline of psychotherapy
6003,While psychoanalysis per se is no longer the preferred method of psychotherapy many forms of psychotherapy can be seen as the direct descendants of Freuds couch
6004,Finally he brought the emotional and the irrational into the realm of science
6005,Whilepoets artists and philosophers had addressed the concerns of psychoanalysis beforefew people had considered these questions in scientific terms
6006,For example the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer wrote about the primacy of unconscious sexual instincts as early as
6007,By  Freuds approachto psychotherapy was just one among many competing forms of psychotherapy
6008,Ultimately it was psychoanalysisthat had the widest impact on the later development of psychotherapy

6010,At the same time he takes on her identity as hisown alter ego
6011,Finally while dressed up as his dead mother he murders MarionCrane to eliminate any possible rival for his attentions
6012,Such unmistakably Oedipalthemes are clearly indebted to Sigmund Freud and psychoanalytic theory
6013,Handy Psychology     PM  Page Although Freud was flexible in his own thinking and he reworked his own theories mul tiple times he was less tolerant of the divergent views of his followers
6014,Although heaspired to make psychoanalysis a science he never tested his theories with the methods of empirical research preferring instead to rely on his clinical observations
6015,Any attention to the unconscious meaning of slips of the tonguejokes or dreams can be traced directly to Freud
6016,Awareness of the impact of childhoodexperiences on adult emotional adjustment the importance of sexuality and the valueof talking out our feelings let alone the now international industry of psychotherapyall owe their debt to Freud
6017,Freudian ideas also captured the imagination of a widerange of famous artists and writers throughout the twentieth century such as the surrealists Virginia Woolf and Alfred Hitchcock
6018,Watson John Watson  spearheaded the triumph of behaviorism in American psy chology
6019,Reacting against the emphasis on introspection promoted by both Wundt andJames he believed that the only object of psychological study should be observable behavior
6020,He criticized the introspective approach as imprecise and dependent onunverifiable and therefore unreliable subjective judgments
6021,Influenced by the Russian psychologist Ivan Pavlovs work on associative conditioning he reduced all of psychology to stimulusresponse chains
6022,Having also spent the beginning of his career studying rats in mazes Watson fur ther broke down the division between animal and human research stating that stimulusresponse behavioral chains in animals did not meaningfully differ from those inhumans
6023,Moreover he feltthe purpose of such study was the prediction and control of behavior
6024,This viewpoint was articulated in a  publication entitled Psychology as the Behaviorist Sees It
6025,While behaviorism became less restrictive in later years this cel Handy Psychology     PM  Page ebration of observable behavior and disdain for subjective experience dominated American academic psychology until the middle of the twentieth century
6026,He was in fact arrested twice before he managed toconvince the president of a South Carolina college to admit him as a freshman at theage of sixteen
6027,The brash confidence displayed by his appeal to the college president was charac teristic of the ambition and audacity that would later propel his career
6028,He excelledacademically and quickly progressed from student to graduate student to assistantshipto professor at the University of Chicago and then by age thirty to chairman of thepsychology department at Johns Hopkins University

6032,We can speculate about the relationship between Watsons painful childhood and his choice of psychological theories
6033,He was inter ested both in the theory of behaviorism and its application to everyday problems
6034,His INTRODUCING THE BASICSHandy Psychology     PM  Page two most important contributions include the principles of operant conditioning and the techniques of behavioralmodification
6035,He was also interested ineducational methods and in techniques ofanimal training
6036,Although Skinners radical behaviorism has been out of fashionfor several decades many of his coreideas survive
6037,While they cannot explainall of human psychology they do offerimportant insights into a broad range ofbehavior
6038,Moreover the techniques heproposed are still fundamental tools in adramatically broad range of disciplines
6039,If a behavior is followedby a reward it is likely to be repeated
6040,If itis followed by a punishment it is less like ly to be repeated
6041,Thes e basic concepts of operant conditioning were viewed as the foundation of all learned behavior in both humans and animals
6042,While we nowknow that there are many complex forms of thought that operant conditioning cannotexplain these principles do tell us a tremendous amount about basic forms of learningand memory
6043,Although John Watson had declared the purpose of behaviorism tobe the prediction and control of behavior he did not have much success in formulating specific techniques to be applied to everyday life
6044,Handy Psychology     PM  Page over punishment to modify behavior as he felt a reliance on punishment created more problems than it solved
6045,He initially developed his behavior modification techniquesfor use with psychotic psychiatric patients but variations of his techniques have beenapplied to work with juvenile delinquents and emotionally disturbed children
6046,Similartechniques have been adapted for use with animal training child rearing and manyother disciplines
6047,a rat pressing a bar to a counting mechanism so that the number of times thebehavior was performed would be automatically recorded
6048,This way the frequency ofthe behavior could be compared across different reinforcement conditions
6049,Thus learning progresses step by stepwith positive reinforcement given after each step is mastered
6050,INTRODUCING THE BASICS Did Skinner raise his daughter in a Skinner box Skinner also developed a form of cribplaypen that he termed an air cribalso called a babytender or an heir conditioner
6051,This was a large well lit and temperaturecontrolled chamber for a small child
6052,He raised his seconddaughter Deborah in this chamber for the first few years of her life
6053,Although criticsassumed his daughter had been damaged by a bizarrely technical approach tochild rearing Skinner always maintained that his daughter had not suffered andhad in fact grown up to be a welladjusted collegeeducated artist
6054,He published his first scientificpaper on the albino sparrow at age ten although the publisher had no idea of his extraordinary youth
6055,For four years in his early teens he classified mollusks in the Neuchtel Natural History Museum in Switzerland
6056,He published several more scholarlypapers from ages fifteen to eighteen
6057,Cornut introduced him to philosophy sparking Piagets interest in epistemology the philosophical study of knowledge
6058,Simonalong with Alfred Binet was the author ofthe BinetSimon intelligence test thefirst successful test of its kind
6059,Piagetsjob was to record the answers of five toeightyearold children in order to determine expected scores for each age group
6060,Although he was hired to record the correct answers he became far more interested in the childrens mistakes in thetypical patterns of error at each age
6061,Thissparked his interest in the developmentof childrens intellectual understandingof the world around them
6062,For the next sixty yearsPiaget studied childrens behavior ingreat detail
6063,From this data he generateda voluminous body of writings on thesubject and changed the way we look atintellectual development
6064,Jean Piaget  made fundamental contributions to our understanding of childrens intellectual developmentAPWideWorld
6065,As such it constructs a view of reality through this shaping and transforming of information
6066,This concept is referred to asPiagets constructivist view of knowledge
6067,Moreover the way that the mind organizes information changes across child development
6068,So younger children do not simplyknow less than older children or adults they know differently
6069,His work has been profoundly influential to many branches of psychology developmental cognitive educational and even clinical
6070,Piagets solution to this ancient dilemma was to propose that knowledge isboth innate and learned
6071,The memories of these encountersare encoded in their minds as knowledge
6072,By chance the child shakes it and it makes noise
6073,Infants initial knowledge of the world is through action INTRODUCING THE BASICSHandy Psychology     PM  Page schemas or sensorymotor schemas
6074,This means the child can only know the world through immediate sensation or direct action such as bringing the thumb into the mouth or seeing bicycle wheels go round and round
6075,Around nine months of agethese action schemas begin to exist in the mind alone
6076,A mental representation of an event is called a conceptual schema
6077,In assimilation the new is fitted into the old in accommodation the old is adapted tothe new
6078,Accomodation means that a schemawill become modified by new information
6079,For example an infant is handed a rattlethat is shaped differently than any previously encountered rattles
6080,Because of the different shape the infant has to grasp it in a different way
6081,Thus the schema of graspingthe rattle has just accommodated to the new action
6082,Assimilation is the complement of accommodation and refers to the way new information is adapted to previously existing schemas
6083,This reflects an attempt toassimilate the new action with the preexisting rattle schema
6084,Piaget developed this concept while studying the behavior of his own children
6085,He noticed that before theage of eight or nine months if he removed an object of interest from his child e
6086,Once it was out of sight it was out of mind

6089,He cannot explain all of childrens mental lifebut he did tell us a tremendous amount about early cognitive development
6090,Their mother was a trained psychologist herself and helped in these studies
6091,Relying on a naturalistic approach for the most part heobserved their natural behavior questioned them about their understanding of naturalevents or minimally modified their environment for example by manipulating toys
6092,Perhaps the most important are Behaviorism Gestalt Theory Psychoanalyticand Psychodynamic Theory Humanistic Theories Attachment Theory SociobiologyNeurobiological Theories and Cognitive Science
6093,Some of these movements were natural outgrowths of earlier ones
6094,Most contemporary psychologists do not limit themselves to any one theoretical view
6095,Nonetheless these movements have shaped psychologys history and continue toinfluence contemporary psychologists orientation to research and practice
6096,Thus it isimportant to understand the major movements in the history of psychology to trulyappreciate modern findings
6097,Behaviorists believe mental phenomena are impossible to measure objectively and thus impossible to prove
6098,They therefore focus on theprocesses underlying behavioral change specifically classical or associative or Pavlovian conditioning and operant conditioning
6099,These basic learning principlesoperate in humans and animals alike or at least in mammals and birds
6100,Although Freudian psychoanalysis educational psychology and other mental schools of psychology continued in  MAJOR  MOVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGYHandy Psychology     PM  Page tandem behaviorism was the dominant force in American psychology until well into the middle of the twentieth century
6101,As a side note hewas also the author of the Thorndike dictionary
6102,Thorndike turned to the study ofchickens while still a graduate student and then expanded his research to observationsof cats and dogs
6103,Heobserved that animals initially stumble on the escape route e
6104,stepping on a peddleor biting a string through trial and error
6105,Based on this research Thorndike formulated two laws of learning
6106,The Law of Effect states that the effect of an action will determine the likelihood that it will be repeated
6107,In other words if the response generates a satisfying effect the cat pulls thestring and the door opens the cat is more likely to pull the string again
6108,If the actiongenerates a negative impact the animal is less likely to repeat the action
6109,Thorndikes Law of Exercise likewise contributed to theories of associative conditioning
6110,Here he stated that the strength of an association between a responseand a stimulus will depend on the number of times they have been paired and thestrength of their pairing
6111,Thorndike thus took the associationism of philosophers such as Thomas Hobbes and placed it into a scientific paradigm
6112,As no one can see inside of it it is not worthy of study
6113,This extremeantimentalism of the behaviorists has been frequently criticized and was finally put to rest by the cognitive revolution in the s
6114,While the behaviorists made invaluablecontributions to psychology regarding the fundamental principles of behavioralchange their devaluing and dismissal of subjective experience was extremely limiting
6115,In other wordsthey salivated in the absence of actual food
6116,Initially this phenomenonwas a nuisance interfering with hisstudy of digestion but later itbecame the focus of his research
6117,Pavlovs studies provided the basis ofthe theory of classical conditioningalso known as associative or Pavlovian conditioning
6118,Pavlov developed his famous theory of classical conditioning after watching dogs salivate right before mealtime at themere sight or sound of their keeper  iStock
6119,In Thorndikes Law of Effect and the theory of operant conditioning that followed the likelihood that a behavior will be increased or decreaseddepends on its emotional impact
6120,While it ismore difficult to speak of emotions in animals modern scientists assume that thesimple emotional processes involved in learning theorythat is forms of pleasureand painapply to both animals and humans
6121,If a neutral stimulus is paired with an emotionally meaningful one than the neutral stimulus will become associated with the second stimulus and elicit the same response
6122,For example if a child learns to associate a particularperfume with a beloved grandmother the child will develop a positive response to theperfume
6123,In contrast if the child learns to associate going to the doctor with getting apainful shot then the child will learn to fear the doctor
6124,This basic concept is used inHandy Psychology     PM  Page child rearing advertising political campaigns the treatment of addictions and much of animal training
6125,For example the child does not have to learn to feel pain from the shot
6126,The conditioned stimulus is a formerly neutralstimulus that now elicits a response through its pairing with the conditioned stimulus
6127,The perfume that the child associates with his grandmother is a conditioned stimulus
6128,The doctor that the child associates with the shot is also a conditioned stimulus
6129,The conditioned response is the learned response for example loving the grandmothers perfume or fearing the doctor
6130,ahatred of fish phobias a fear of dogs positive associations an association of Pariswith a romantic vacation our behavior reflects classical conditioning
6131,It is thereforeno accident that so many advertising campaigns hire young beautiful and skimpilyclad models
6132,The advertisers want consumers to associate their productbe it a washing machine paper clip or automobilewith youth beauty and sex
6133,If the effect of the behavior is Handy Psychology     PM  Page positive then it is reinforced and the behavior is more likely to recur
6134,If the effect of the behavior is negative then it is punished and therefore less likely to be repeated
6135,For example if a child is given an ice cream cone as consolation after throwing a temper tantrum the temper tantrum has been reinforced
6136,Negative reinforcement to be distinguished from punishment involves the removal of a negative condition as a consequence of the targeted behavior
6137,In the s a man with a saxophone and a small kitten on his shoulder frequented the New York City subways
6138,He would play a harsh note on the saxophone as loudly aspossible and offer to stop only if the passengers gave him money
6139,While these experiments successfully support the principles of conditioned learningWatson was chillingly insensitive to the emotional impact of his research methods on the baby
6140,The presence of the rat was then paired with a loud noisecreated by banging a hammer against a steel pipe
6141,This was repeated several timesuntil little Albert grew terrified at the mere sight of the rat
6142,This generalized fear was still present several months after the original experiment
6143,Today human subjects review committees are required in all research insti tutions in order to protect the rights of research subjects
6144,Handy Psychology     PM  Page the principles of negative reinforcement though it might also be called blackmail
6145,Likewisethe criminal justice system relies on punishment to maintain an orderly and lawful society
6146,Skinner distrustedpunishment as well stating that it had only short term effects and it did not teachalternative behavior
6147,Even pigeons can be shaped to do a particularbehavior such as peck at a lever by successively rewarding behavior that more closelyapproximates the desired behavior
6148,This can be a positive thing if the behavior was undesirable to begin with
6149,It can also be negative if the behavior was valued
6150,In general the behaviorshould eventually extinguish if it is no longer accompanied by either the prior reinforcement or the unconditioned stimulus
6151,If you stop paying people to go to workthey will probably stop going
6152,If you stopped taking your dog for a walk after you puton your shoes the dog will eventually stop barking and wagging his tail each time youput them on
6153,Timing is important specifically the time separating the unconditioned and conditioned stimulus
6154,If thesneakers go on too soon before the dog is walked it will be hard to associate the shoeswith the walk
6155,Relatedly the reinforcement should closely follow the behavior for the act to be con nected with the consequence
6156,Craving or the urge to use the problem drug can be very strong and frequently leads to relapses inpeople striving for sobriety
6157,Craving is triggered by cues both external and internal via the process of classical conditioning
6158,This is basicallythe same conditioning process Pavlov noticed with his dogs
6159,Internal cues includeemotions thought or physical sensations that previously led to drug use
6160,It will take longer for them to give up on the behavior
6161,Animals kept behaving in ways that could not be explained by behaviorist theoryalone
6162,For example Skinner had thought that any animal could be taught any behavior with the appropriate reinforcement schedule
6163,The same behavior was learned easily by some animals with difficulty by othersand not at all by still others
6164,Rats could easily learn to press a bar for food while catswould do so only with difficulty
6165,Despite his expectations he repeatedly observed behavior in rats that he could not explain solely by stimulusresponse connections
6166,He noticed that rats in a maze would often stop lookaround and check out one path then another before choosing a particular route
6167,Hecould only explain this behavior and many other similar behaviors he observed byinferring some kind of mental process
6168,The rat seemed to have a mental picture of thelayout of the maze and that directed its behavior
6169,In this way Tolman introduced themind into the behaviorist stronghold
6170,Even rats running mazes evidenced mentalprocesses some form of thinking about the problem
6171,If the gambler hadbeen rewarded for every bet it would take fewer losses for the gambler to disassociate betting with winning and for the act of gambling to be extinguished
6172,Thus casinos take advantage of an intermittent and unpredictable reinforcementschedule in order to keep gamblers gambling as long as possible
6173,Rats and other animals did not simply respond to the number of rewards for each behaviorautomatically repeating the most frequently rewarded behavior
6174,They then made decisions by matching their expectations against information from the new situation
6175,This kind of mental map is essentially identical toPiagets concept of mental schemas and has become a critical concept in many areasof psychology including cognitive developmental and clinical psychology
6176,Research in various other fields of study such as anthropology linguistics and computer science hadbeen moving toward the scientific study of mental processes
6177,Within psychology studies of memory perception personality traits and other mental phenomena continuedto gain ground
6178,As these lines of development came together the mind once again became a worthy object of study
6179,Theblack box model of psychology was rejected and cognition or thought processes per sebecame the object of intense interest
6180,With the renewed interested in cognitiveprocesses there was also a resurgence of an earlier movement that had started inEurope but migrated to the United States after World War II namely Gestalt psychology
6181,Gestalt psychology originated in  with MaxWertheimers study of the perception of motion
6182,In other words the mind is not a passiverecipient of sensory stimuli but an active organizer of information
6183,Furthermoreknowledge does not come from a collection of isolated bits of information
6184,The gestalt is created out of the relationships between the parts
6185,Our perceptual knowledge of the world is based on our recognition of these relationships
6186,Although a table can be large or small metal or wood dark or light we recognize anobject as a table if it has a flat horizontal plane with one or more supports underneathit
6187,Its gestalt is determined by the relationship among its parts
6188,As the sensory stimulation coming in differs depending upon the circumstance we would not be able to recognize an object or person as thesame across different situations if our mind did not actively organize our perceptions torecognize the gestalt
6189,For example we recognize our neighbor as the same person even if he loses weight changes his clothes or cuts his hair
6190,Although the landscape outside the train was stationary it seemed to be moving backwards as the train sped by
6191,Together they studied the illusion of movement through various experiments
6192,Their research into the phi effect as Wertheimer named it was thebeginning of a lifelong shared commitment to Gestalt research and theory
6193,By themids all three men had relocated to the United States Koffka before Hitlers riseto power and Wertheimer and Khler in direct response to it
6194,For one thing by demonstrating itsprinciples with solid empirical research Gestalt theory put the mind back into acade mic psychology
6195,In the photo to the right afield of rounded dots can seen aseither convex rows of buttons or asconcave rows of holes
6196,Notice thatyou can perceive either buttons orholes but you cannot perceive both atthe same time
6197,In order for your perception to switch you have to look atsomething other than the dots suchas the flat area between the dots
6198,A field of dots can appear to be either convex or concave depending on ones perception of them  iStock
6199,MAJOR MOVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGY sharp contrast to the associationist approach found in both behaviorism and Wilhelm Wundts structuralism
6200,In associationism complex knowledge is seen to derive entirely from associations between simple memories
6201,Thetelephone the motor car the moving pictureall of these were relatively recentinventions and all of them radically changed society
6202,Science was exploding across theindustrialized world and there was a widely shared assumption that the only worthwhile way to understand reality was through the methods used in the physical sciences
6203,And these methods largely reflected an analytic approach to reason
6204,In other words the way to understand complex phenomena such as human psy chology was to break it down into its smallest parts such as stimulusresponse associations
6205,Complexity in and of itself had no interest it simply reflected a grouping ofHandy Psychology     PM  Page smaller parts
6206,Like Wertheimer and his colleagues James did not believe we can understand reality simply by breaking it down into its elemental parts
6207,These include the rules of proximity similarity simplicity and closure
6208,The first two rules suggest that objects that are placed closely together proximity orare similar to each other similarity will be grouped together into a gestalt
6209,Closure reflects the tendency to fill in the gaps of agestalt
6210,If we see a circle with sections missing we will still see it as a circle
6211,Consider that human beings are composed of cells and tissues
6212,But canwe ever explain our loves our personalities our prejudices and even our taste inmusic solely by studying the behavior of our atoms Or by studying our cellsThe Gestaltists would say no
6213,Although Gestalt theory is best known for itswork with perception this core concept has been applied to almost every aspectof psychology
6214,It has influenced Piagetian developmental psychologists cognitive psychologists and even psychotherapists

6218,Although not all chimpanzees were able to successfully solve the problemevi dently chimpanzees like human beings vary in their intelligencethose that did soexhibited similar behavior
6219,For one they would often try to reach the bananas simplyby jumping or reaching for them
6220,Eventually after surveying the entire room they would suddenly derive a solution involving the use of nearbyobjects as tools
6221,One chimp might drag a box under the bananas and then climb on topof it to reach them
6222,Anothermight put two sticks together to create a stick long enough to reach the food
6223,For one the animals arrived at their solutions onlyafter surveying the entire environment
6224,They did not just focus on a single object buttook the entire field into account
6225,Secondly the problem was not solved through trial and error via rewards and punishments as the behaviorists would have predicted
6226,Instead the animal arrived at a complete solution all at once
6227,In other words thechimps did not solve problems in a piecemeal fashion but rather in a holistic way
6228,Khler referred to this holistic form of problem solving as insight learning
6229,This insight often came suddenly in a sort of AHa moment
6230,In one case a Was Khler a German spy There has been controversy regarding Khlers stay in the Canary Islands duringWorld War I
6231,A number of people specifically British intelligence agents believed he was a German spy
6232,Evidently they were not convinced that his fascination with chimpanzees and bananas was sufficient explanation of his presence
6233,Some contemporary writers still believe the issue is unsettled although no evidencehas been produced that proves he was anything more than a Gestalt psychologist
6234,Handy Psychology     PM  Page chimpanzee put two sticks together to create a tool long enough to reach the bananas
6235,Another chimp stacked three boxes on top of each other to reach the fruit hangingfrom the ceiling
6236,This is in contrast to the behaviorist assumption that problem solvingcan only proceed piecemeal by trial and error
6237,Gestalt therapy is commonlyconsidered part of humanistic psychology and incorporates principles from the philosophical schools of phenomenology and existentialism as well as psychoanalysis andGestalt psychology
6238,Psychoanalysis was so prominent because it provided a comprehensive theory of psychopathology and a psychological method of treating mental distress
6239,It is fairto say that most if not all subsequent theories of psychopathology and psychotherapyowe an enormous debt to psychoanalysis
6240,Although many schools of psychotherapy were formed in reaction against psycho analysis they were still defined in response to it and therefore must be seen as its descendants
6241,Psychoanalytic theory actually includes a broad range of theoretical writing starting with Sigmund Freuds original contributions in the late nineteenth century
6242,Did Freud change his theory over time Freud changed his theories several times over the course of his long career
6243,He initially proposed the seduction theory to explain hysteria a common disorder of the latenineteenth century involving physical complaints without an actual physical basis
6244,In otherwords the symptoms were caused by the patients disguised wishes rather than memories of real events
6245,Freud also moved from a topological theory focusing on the rela tionship between conscious and unconscious processes to a structural model focused on the id ego and superego
6246,Finally in the s Freud added the instinctual force ofThanatos the death instinct to his theory of instincts
6247,In the unconscious the individual is not aware of the contents of the mind
6248,In the preconscious mental content is capable of entering into consciousness but is not currently there
6249,There is no block between conscious and preconscious as there is between the conscious and the unconscious
6250,The conscious part ofthe mind contains all the mental content that is in our awareness
6251,While Freud still believed in unconsciousprocesses he became more and more interested in the compartmentalization of the mindinto the id ego and superego
6252,The id translated literally as the it contains the animal istic passions that must be subdued in order for civilization to function
6253,Theego Latin for the I mediates between the id and reality
6254,The ego operates on the realityprinciple and recognizes that the world does not always obey our desires
6255,It is formed through our internalization of our parents rulesand discipline
6256,A weak superego results in selfindulgent poorly disciplined or immoral behavior
6257,In fact he parted ways with some of his favorite protges after they proposed competing theories about human motivation
6258,Libido can beloosely translated as the sexual instinct but really refers to all aspects of sensual pleasure
6259,In Freuds view instincts press for release as part of the pleasure principle
6260,Ifthe instinct is blocked from release it will seek another outlet much like a river run Handy Psychology     PM  Page ning downstream
6261,This mechanistic view of human motivation was called the hydraulic model and reflects the scientific models of the day
6262,Because pleasure canonly be found through the reduction of tension there must be a drive to reach a stateof total quiescence a state of no tension at all
6263,We now realize that pleasure comes from the buildup of tension aswell the release of tension
6264,In keepingwith nineteenthcentury mechanics he looked for one single force that could explainall of human behavior
6265,It is possible that many of the psychological symptoms his femaleclients exhibited truly were related to repressed sexuality
6266,Patients laid down on his famous couch while Freud sat behind them in his chair
6267,Handy Psychology     PM  Page of Freuds theories including the theory of libido and of psychosexual stages were translated into emotional and interpersonal terms
6268,Around this age the little boy falls inlove with his mother
6269,Recognizing his father as his rival he feels murderous ragetoward his father controlled only by his fear of his fathers greater strength
6270,His fearthat his father will cut off his penis in retaliation is termed castration anxiety
6271,As a solution to this dilemma the little boy identifies with his father realizing that he will grow up to be a man just like him and then have a wife all his own
6272,Thisinternalization of the father and the fathers authority is seen to be the foundation ofthe superego and of a boys moral development
6273,Psychoanalysis has been trashed as all hocuspocus Freuds writings havealso been treasured as the bible and seen as infallible
6274,Modern neuroscience for example has revealed the frontal lobe and thelimbic system to function dramatically similarly to the ego and the id
6275,Twenty years separated Freuds parents Amalia and Jacob the same age difference between Freud andhis mother
6276,She died at age  only nine years before her son died
6277,In contemporary psychoanaly sis the schools of object relations self psychology and relational theory have translated Freuds original ideas into interpersonal terms
6278,Principles from attachment theoryand ideas about selfreflective functioning as found in the work of Peter Fonagy andMary Target have also informed contemporary psychoanalysis
6279,Arguably the integration of psychoanalytic concepts with advances in neuroscience currently forms thecutting edge of psychoanalytic theory
6280,Whileclearly grounded in Freudian psychoanalysis Jungian analytical psychologymoves away from the dominance of libidoand toward a mystical understanding ofthe human unconscious
6281,Fairly early in his career Jung worked in Zurich at the renownedBurghlzli clinic under Eugen Bleulera prominent psychiatrist and the originator of the term schizophrenia
6282,HereJung became involved in research withword association detecting unconscious meaning through the way peoplegrouped words together
6283,This work ledhim to Freuds psychoanalytic researchand the two men met in
6284,Handy Psychology     PM  Page  on Jung referred to  his own work as analytical psychology to differentiate it from Freudian psychoanalysis
6285,Jung rose quickly within the psychoanalytic world becoming editor of a psychoanalytic journal and president of the International Psychoanalytic Association
6286,Freudfavored him in part because as a nonJew he offered a bridge to the wider nonJewishscientific community in Europe
6287,He agreed with Freuds energybased conception of psychological motivationthat normal and abnormal psychologicalprocesses were a product of energy flowbut he believed sexuality to form only asmall part of human motivation
6288,Jung had a mystical bent nur tured perhaps through his familys religious heritage and a lifelong interest in theoccult
6289,Freud was a fervent rationalist believing religion to be little more than aninfantile form of neurosis
6290,It is unlikely Freud would have had much respect for theoccult either except perhaps as clinical material
6291,Jungalso believed like Freud that repressed and forbidden ideas were banished to theunconscious intentionally kept out of consciousness
6292,Jungwas strongly attracted to Eastern religions and viewed the mandala as a symbol of the personality
6293,For Jung and his followers the structure of the mandala with its four corners bound to a central circle represents the path of personal development
6294,In our personal growth we strive to unite the opposingforces of our personality the four corners into a comprehensive allinclusiveselfawareness the central circle
6295,To gain this awareness we must turn inwardjust as the outer corners of mandala point inward toward the circle

6298,The personal unconscious contained personal experiences that had slipped out of con sciousness due either to simple forgetting or repression
6299,The contents of the personalunconscious came from the individuals life experience
6300,It contained the entirelibrary of our typical reactions to universal human situations
6301,It was not limited to theindividuals life but encompassed the great impersonal truths of existence
6302,He divided the conscious mind into both functional modes and attitudes toward the world
6303,The functional types refer to ways that people process information
6304,Believing the mind to be composed of opposites in continual tension witheach other he proposed two polarities thinking vs
6305,You could not process theworld through feeling and through thinking at the same time
6306,One side of the polaritywas always dominant the other relegated back to the unconscious
6307,The extrovert attends primarily to external reality to other people and objects
6308,This test uses all three polarities mentioned above extroversion vs
6309,Extroversion is also measuredon scales associated with the Five Factor Model of personality such as the NEO personality inventory
6310,This test formulated to identify dimensions of personality in nonpathological adults uses  items to quantify five areas neuroticism extroversionopenness to experience agreeableness and conscientiousness
6311,There is a mother archetype a child archetype an archetype of thefeminine of the masculine and many more
6312,Archetypes can never be directly knownin consciousness but can only be glimpsed through the images that float up from ourunconscious in dreams creative works of art mythology and even religious symbolism
6313,Through interpretation of this visual symbolism we gain greater knowledge ofour deepest selves
6314,Similar tothe Gestalt psychologists the humanistic psychologists reacted against the constraints of the dominant psychological schools of their time but the humanistic psychologists had better timing
6315,They arrived on the scene just as the dominance ofbehaviorism and psychoanalysis was beginning to fade
6316,In fairly short order theybecame powerful counterpoints to the orthodoxies of both schools
6317,In general humanistic psychologists wanted to inject humanity back into the study of human beings
6318,More specifically they objected to a mechanical view of psychology to the portrayal of human beings as passive objects at the mercy of eitherstimulusresponse chains or unconscious drives
6319,They insisted that people are activeparticipants in their own lives
6320,They also valued the richness of subjective experience and concerned themselves with the qualities of lived experience of human consciousness
6321,In contrast to Freud they believed that people are inherently motivated toward psychological growthand will naturally move toward health with proper encouragement and support
6322,He visited the Pueblo Indians in New Mexico he traveled to Kenya and India and he collaborated onstudies of various Eastern religions
6323,He viewed the symbolism in all the religioustraditions as expressions of universal archetypes
6324,Our happiness is dependent upon our communionwith a universal reality that is part of us but yet larger than us
6325,In his concept ofthe collective unconscious he combined psychology evolutionary biology andthe spiritual traditions of many diverse cultures

6327,Phenomenology an earlier branch of European philosophy also influenced the humanistic psychologists with its focus on the rich complexity of subjective experience
6328,With regardto psychological schools the functionalism of William James also played a role as didthe holistic theories of the Gestalt psychologists
6329,Humanistic psychologists wanted to create an alternative to these two great forces a third force in psychology
6330,Maslow wrote a number of books and also madeseveral important theoretical contributions
6331,He is perhaps best known for his concept of the hierarchy of needs
6332,Maslow believed that human psychological needs aremultidimensional and that there is no single motivating force to explain all of humanbehavior
6333,He believed these needs could be organized hierarchically with the mostfundamental needs related to biological survival
6334,Once our fundamental biologicalneedssuch as thirst hunger and warmthare met our needs for safety comeinto play
6335,Following satisfaction of safety needs psychological needs for emotionalbonds with other people become important
6336,Once those are met we become concerned with selfesteem and the need to feel recognized and valued in a community

6339,Inhis view self actualized people make the strongest leaders and the greatest contributions to society
6340,This concept illustrates humanistic psychologys concern with personal growth and psychological health in contrast to psychoanalysis emphasis on psychopathology and mental illness
6341,Like William James and Carl Jung before him Maslow believed themystical and ecstatic aspects of religion were proper subjects of psychological study
6342,Dlove or deficiencylove refers to a kind of grasping possessive love
6343,In this state we cling to the loved one outof desperate dependency and see the loved one as a means to fill come kind of deficiency in ourselves
6344,Blove or beinglove reflects a love based on full acceptance of theother person
6345,Naturally Blove is seen as the healthier and more sustainable kindof love
6346,Maslow was very focused on the importance of rising above selfish desires inorder to embrace other people for their own sake rather than as means to a goal
6347,Carl Rogerss personcentered psychotherapy FritzPerlss Gestalt therapy named after Gestalt psychology but more closely tied tohumanistic psychology Victor Frankls logotherapy and Rollo Mays existential psychoanalysis are all children of humanistic psychology
6348,His school of personcentered psy MAJOR MOVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGYHandy Psychology     PM  Page chotherapy originally known as clientcentered psychotherapy and often simply referred to as Rogerian therapy placed the clients subjective experience at the forefront of the therapy
6349,He believed the therapists role was less to untangle psychopathology than to promote the clients personal growth through empathic listening and unconditional positive regard
6350,While Rogers has been criticized for a relativedisregard of negative emotions and interpersonal conflict therapeutic empathy is now universally recognized as an essential ingredient of psychotherapy
6351,These notions are similar to Maslowsconcepts of Blove and Dlove
6352,He believed themethods of empirical research could and should be applied to the practice of psychotherapy
6353,Rogers also systematically measured improvement by administeringpsychological tests preand posttreatment and then compared the results of subjectsin therapy with those in a control group
6354,Similarto Carl Rogers attachment theorists believed that scientific methods could be usefullyapplied to the study of emotional and interpersonal phenomena
6355,Thus attachment theory was the first movement to bring scientific methods to bear on psychoanalyticideas
6356,Not surprisingly this occasioned resistance at first but over time attachmenttheory has been accepted by most psychoanalytic schools
6357,Handy Psychology     PM  Page Attachment refers to a biologically based drive in the child to form an enduring emotional bond with the caregiver generally the mother
6358,Disturbed by the dismissal of reallifeevents in the psychoanalytic world view Bowlbys insistence on the realtime influenceof the mothers presence often put him at odds with his colleagues
6359,Bowlby was alsointerested in ethology the study of animal behavior and eventually synthesized bothpsychoanalytic theory and ethology into his theory of infantmother attachment
6360,Thechild will reach toward the mother cryto be picked up or crawl close to themother
6361,In Bowlbys view the child ismotivated to attain a sense of felt security a subjective experience of safety andwellbeingperhaps a kind of cozy contentment
6362,At these points the child will ventureaway from the mother to explore theworld to play
6363,This is a kind of mental map or script of the caregiver and the self
6364,Through repeated attachment experiences the child develops expectations about the availability and responsiveness of the mother or caregiver
6365,While Bowlby had initially been interested in the universaleffect of motherchild separation Ainsworth was interested in individual differences inthe quality of attachment based on the nature of the motherchild relationship
6366,Byobserving twentyeight Ugandan babies she noted individual differences in the qualityof motherinfant attachment
6367,Here she studied motherchild interactions both in their homes and in the laboratory during an experimentalprocedure she termed the strange situation
6368,Based on the childs responses to separa tions and reunions with the mother the child could be classified into secure and insecure attachment categories
6369,Ainsworth also found that attachment status in the labcorrelated with the mothers behavior toward the child in the home
6370,Ainsworths publication of this data in her  book Patterns of Attachment was a milestone in attachment research
6371,This fairly simple experimental paradigm would dramaticallychange psychological research into child development
6372,There are eightepisodes to the strange situation the first lasting only thirty seconds and the rest up tothree minutes
6373,The babys reactions during the two separation and reunion episodes arecarefully observed through the oneway mirror
6374,Based mainly on these behaviors the babyis classified as either securely attached or into one of three insecurely attached categories
6375,Most importantly in the reunion episodes thechild directly sought out contact with the mother
6376,If the child was distressed after theseparation contact with the mother was effective in soothing the child
6377,This pattern ofbehavior is seen to reflect the childs felt security in the mothers availability and responsivity to the childs attachment needs
6378,The child thenmodifies his or her attachment behavior to adapt to the mothers behavior
6379,Ainsworth originally proposed two categories avoidant and resistant attachment but another category disorganized attachment was added later
6380,Most importantly they turn away from theirmother upon reunion hence they are avoidant
6381,Resistant babies or C babies may be seen as overly dependent
6382,Are insecurely attached children less attached to their parents than are securely attached children No
6383,Biology ensures that all children are powerfully attached to their caregivers
6384,But this does notmean they vary with regard to the power of their attachment to their caregivers
6385,Avoidant attachment behavior is considered to reflect adown regulation of attachment in response to a reliably unresponsive mother
6386,Mothers of resistant babies were found to be unreliably responsive to the childs attach ment cues in the home setting
6387,Thus resistant attachment may be seen as a strategy tomaximize their mothers attention by ratcheting up their attachment system
6388,These babies cannot find a consistentstrategy to deal with their parents erratic or even frightening behavior
6389,The way mothers respond to their babies emotional cues affects the quality of the infants attachment
6390,Parents of securely att ached infants are reliably and sensitively responsive to the childs emotional communications
6391,Parents of insecurely attached children fail to respond sensitively to their childrens emotional cues or at least do so inconsistently  iStock
6392,They can be explained by the laws of operant conditioning
6393,Avoidant attachment reflects the extinction of attachmentseeking behavior after these behaviors have consistently failed to elicit a response from the mother
6394,The child learns to crank up the attachment behaviors in order to maximizethe likelihood of the desired response from the mother
6395,Is your attachment status fixed by the time youre one year old Attachment research is sometimes interpreted as implying that personality is entirelyformed by the time that a child is one year old
6396,Attachment strategies are conservativethat is they are resistant to change but they are notfixed
6397,If the family environment remains stable and the parentchild interaction patterns do not change dramatically itis likely that the childs general approach to attachment will remain stable
6398,On theother hand if the family environment changes dramatically or if the parent chooses tochange his or her way of relating to the child the childs attachment status can change
6399,A single mother getting married or a father losing his job can make theparents more or less available to the child and thus impact the childs attachment status
6400,This may be becauselower income families have less buffer against changes in the environment than dofamilies with greater financial means
6401,A semistructuredinterview provides specific questions as well as openended followup questions
6402,There is a script to follow but the interviewer can deviate from it to clarify information
6403,The interview takes about an hour and a half and asks questions about the subjects childhood relationship with his or her parents
6404,Ofmost importance is the coherence of their narrative specifically between theirabstract generalizations about their childhood attachment relationships e
6405,I remember making chocolate chip cookies with her in ourkitchen
6406,The narrative is coherent if the story makes sense if it is riddled with contradictions it is not coherent
6407,She labeled them DE and F to match Ainsworths A B and C
6408,Dismissing adults D were hypothesized to correspond to avoidant babies A Enmeshed adultsE to correspond to resistant babies C and Secure adults F for Free to correspondwith secure babies B
6409,She recognized that quality of attachment could not be easily cap tured in behavior as it could be with infants but would have to be investigatedas an enduring part of personality
6410,She built on Bowlbys concept of internalworking models to consider the way adults represent attachment relations
6411,A representation is like a mental image or map of relationships
6412,Sheacknowledges contradictions and mixed emotions but can reflect objectively on therelationship
6413,The preoccupied adult in contrast is flooded by her attachmentrelatedmemories and is unable to integrate emotion and thought into a coherent narrative
6414,Dismissing Interviewer Could you tell me five adjectives that describe your childhood rela tionship with your mother Mother Oh I dont know
6415,Interviewer Could you give me an example for each of those words Mother Well you know she was always there
6416,I dont remember any prob lems or like anything that was really wrong
6417,She was a good teachershe always wanted to make sure we got good grades
6418,Secure Interviewer Could you tell me five adjectives that describe your childhood rela tionship with your mother Mother Hmm thats a little complicated
6419,My mother was very warm and very loving but she could also be controlling
6420,Interviewer Could you give me an example for each of those words Mother I remember a lot of affection
6421,I remember curling up with her on the couch in the evenings watching TV
6422,She would insist that I be home earlier thanany of my friends had to
6423,Hmm maybe she was just being responsible but at the time I thought she was unreasonable
6424,Preoccupied Interviewer Could you tell me five adjectives that describe your childhood rela tionship with your mother Mother It was loving absolutely so loving
6425,But you know sometimes she was really selfish totally insensitivelike only out for herself
6426,Interviewer Could you give me an example for each of those words Mother It was unbelievable you know
6427,And all I wanted all MAJOR MOVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGYHandy Psychology     PM  Page I wanted was like Listen to me Mom But not that I didnt love her
6428,Of course I did and still do and I know she loves me more thananything in the world
6429,They can takesome distance from their feelings and be reasonably objective about their experiences
6430,On the AAI secure adults give a coherent account of their childhood relationshipswith their parents and their generalized descriptions of the relationship are supportedby specific memories
6431,In the same way that a securely attached child balances dependency and exploration a securely attached adult balances emotion and thought
6432,Attachment is devalued and dismissed by these adults with a concomitant emphasis on thought separated from emotion
6433,An idealized picture of childhood attachment relationships is presented though itis not backed up by supporting memories
6434,The adult may describe his or her mother asfine normal and a good mother but only provide memories such as Well you know  Securely attached adults tend to be more sensitive to their infants emotional cues  iStock
6435,The impression is of a cool dis tant relationship with minimal recognition of the childs emotional need for the parent
6436,These adults are flooded with memories of attachment relations but cannot take the distance necessaryto create a coherent objective narrative
6437,They provide contradictory rapidly alternating views of their attachment relationships She was loving no she was really selfish
6438,accompanied by a gush of vivid memories I remember on my senior prom
6439,I wanted to wear myblue heels but she said they made my legs look fat
6440,Does a parents attachment style necessarily translate into a childs attachment style There is a strong relationship between security of attachment in parents and securityof attachment in their children
6441,Secure adults are more likely to raise secure childrenand insecure adults are more likely to raise insecure children
6442,Some dismissing mothers may have resistant childrenand some preoccupied mothers may have dismissing children
6443,The ability to mentalize emotional experiences involves the capacity to represent ones own and others mental experiences that is to understand and graspthe nature of emotional experience
6444,In their view the childs security of attachment isnot only dependent on the mothers sensitive behavior but also on her psychological sensitivity
6445,Thechilds development of selfreflective functioning is therefore dependent upon themothers mentalization of the childs experiences
6446,For example both attachment theory and Jung  ian psychology borrow from evolutionary biology
6447,The field of sociobiology explicitlyapplies the principles of evolutionary theory to the understanding of social behavior
6448,This approach assumes that at least some part of social behavior is genetically basedand therefore has been acted upon by evolution
6449,This approach was first applied to the study of nonhuman animals it wasntuntil the s that evolutionary theory was rigorously applied to the study ofhuman social behavior
6450,A professor of entomology the study of insects in the Harvard biology department since  he hasmaintained a lifelong interest in the social behavior of animals
6451,Wilsons great contribution was to state that the evolutionary explanation of animal behavior could be applied to the study of human behavior
6452,He did not mean that culture and environment had no influence only that our behavioral repertoire has its origins in our genetics and has been shaped by the processes ofnatural selection
6453,To many people it was politically offensive because itseemed to dismiss the importance of environment
6454,As with Eugenics and other earliermovements that proclaimed the heritability of human behavior it seemed to endorsesocial inequality as the natural order of things
6455,Withadvances in brain imaging technology and other methods of studying biology ourunderstanding of the biological underpinnings of human behavior has grown dramatically
6456,Likewise our appreciation of the complex interplay between genes and environment has also advanced so that it is now accepted that a focus on the genetic basis ofbehavior does not have to mean that environment is irrelevant
6457,All of biological science is understoodwithin the context of evolution
6458,Likewisehuman beings are biological animals andour behavior is inextricably tied to ourbiology
6459,Thus a clear understanding ofevolutionary principles is critical to theunderstanding of human psychology
6460,Genetics determine the range of possible behaviors the parameters of ourbehavior
6461,For example we cannot learn to read unless we are taught the necessary skills andunless we are exposed to reading materials
6462,With the proper circumstances our geneticmakeup allows us to learn to read
6463,In contrast no amount of training will ever lead a cat a dog or a pigeon to read
6464,Likewise no amount of training will ever allow a human beingto fly without artificial support
6465,Thus genetics determine the potentiality of our behav ior but genetics alone cannot determine the specific outcomes for any given individual
6466,The process goeslike this First there must be variation in a particular trait within a population
6467,Thirdly one version of the trait is better adapted to the environment than another version
6468,Consequently the animals with the more adaptivetrait will bear more young thus passing more of their genes onto the next generation
6469,Lets consider the example of light and dark moths first recorded by Charles Dar win
6470,There were two varieties of moths in England lightcolored moths and darkcolored moths
6471,Originally there were more lightcolored moths than dark ones as thedark ones stood out against the lightcolored tree bark and were easy prey for the localbirds
6472,At this point light color was more adaptive than dark color
6473,Handy Psychology     PM  Page ment than the lightcolored moths as they no longer stood out against the sootcov ered tree bark
6474,Now it was the lightcolored moths that were easy prey for the birds
6475,Hence the population of darkcolored moths grew relative to the population of lightcolored moths as more of the former survived to reproduce and pass their genes on tothe next generation
6476,Thus natural selection acted on the moth population as a result of their coloring
6477,His theory of evolution has influenced every scientific disci pline involved with living organisms
6478,Prior to the theory of evolution the varietyof life on earth was seen as a product of Gods creation
6479,All creation occurredaccording to the book of Genesis with no changes since
6480,To suggest that animalshad changed over time implied that Gods creation was less than perfect
6481,Thus thetheory of evolution challenged Christian theology about the very origins of life
6482,Because of this Darwins theory was highly controversial in its day
6483,Darwin was not the first proponent of a theoryof evolution
6484,In fact his grandfather Erasmus Darwin  contributedto early work on the subject
6485,Darwin gathered evidence for his theory on his famous sea voyage on the H
6486,It took him more than twenty yearsthough to synthesize his observations into a coherent theory
6487,By the time Darwin published his famous essay On the Origins of Species by Means of Natural Selection in  the scientific community was ready toreceive it
6488,The monk Gregor Mendel did not publish his study ofpea plants until  and his work was not appreciated until the beginning ofthe twentieth century
6489,The current view of evolution reflects a synthesis of Darwins theory of natural selection and Mendelian genetics
6490,Handy Psychology     PM  Page associated with them have survived into the next generation
6491,If a trait is common in a population this means that the genesof previous generations with that trait have survived to the present
6492,If there is a larger proportion of gene A in the present generation than in the previousone then the organism with gene A has demonstrated evolutionary fitness
6493,Conversely if the proportion of gene B has decreased across generations then the organismwith gene B has poor fitness
6494,It increasesmale pigeons access to females and thus to reproductive success
6495,This display behavior may make the male look bigger and stronger than he actually is
6496,Females are morelikely to select such males as mates because selection of large and strong males mayconfer an evolutionary advantage for the females offspring
6497,Male displays of strengthand size are very frequent strategies for access to females evident in an extremelywide array of species including our own
6498,Importantly survival of the fittest does not mean thatthe most aggressive and dominant will pass their genes on to the next generation
6499,Dominance is one evolutionary strategy but it is not the only one
6500,For example insome fish species male fish can disguise themselves as females and then sneak intothe dominant males territory to mate with his females
6501,In this case fish that are notthe most dominant nevertheless reproduce successfully
6502,Moreover in many circumstances cooperation and altruism can be useful evolutionary strategiesas effectiveif not more effective than competition and aggression
6503,In keeping with the ideas of Charles Darwins grand MAJOR MOVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGYHandy Psychology     PM  Page father Erasmus Darwin LaMarck believed in the inheritance of acquired characteris tics
6504,In other words an animal adapts to the environment and these changes are then passed onto the animals offspring via some form of heritability
6505,It was thought that giraffes stretched their own necks by reaching up toeat the leaves off the top of tall trees
6506,Similarly mountain goats grew a thicker coat in a cold climate and then passedthis trait onto their offspring
6507,Although LaMarckian evolution has a kind of intuitive appeal there has never been any evidence to support its central premise that acquired behavior is directlycoded into the genes
6508,Some of these genetic mutations will improve the animals adaptation tothe environment though most will not
6509,Those genes that do improve adaptation aremore likely to be passed on to the next generation
6510,Hence the environment influencesreproductive success but does not act upon the genes directly
6511,Worker bees and drones live theirentire lives in service to the queen bee
6512,This was a time of European imperialism intenseimmigration into the United States and growing masses of urbanized poor due tothe industrial revolution
6513,Likewise the idea of survival of thefittest was used to justify this viewpoint
6514,Darwin did not intend evolution to beracist or a justification of social inequity
6515,But his work was misinterpreted to mean that only the strongest and mostworthy will survive and that social disadvantage was a reflection of genetic inferiority
6516,Galtons theory of eugenics is a good example of Social Darwinism
6517,Handy Psychology     PM  Page Likewise altruistic behavior is wide spread in human beings
6518,We give moneyto charity take care of other peopleschildren and may even donate a kidneyto a relative in need
6519,Although altruistic behavior may cost the individual animal it may stillconfer reproductive success if it helpsother animals that share the same genes
6520,Most of us are willing todonate used clothes to children in another country
6521,In many species males and females may have different strategies forreproductive success
6522,Females devote an enormous amount of time and energy to bearing and raising their young
6523,The more complex the species the more this is the case
6524,For example humans chimpanzees and dogs provide much more maternal care than turtles do
6525,Therefore it is in the evolutionary interest of many females to be highly selective in their choice of mates and to seek males that can contribute to care ofthe young
6526,Males on the other hand do not bear young and are not physically boundto the care of the young
6527,They can inseminate a large number of females but give little resources tothe care of their offspring e
6528,buffalo wildebeests or they can inseminate fewerfemales have more offspring with them and give much more time and energy to thecare of their young e
6529,gorillas furseals compete for exclusive access to a group of females devoting considerable energyto protecting their harems from encroachment from rival males
6530,Handy Psychology     PM  Page Are men inherently polygamous  Across history human males have exhibited all of the above reproductive strategies
6531,Whilehuman females are not immune to the temptations of multiple partners polygamoussocieties with polygynous marital patterns men with multiple wives are far more com mon than those with polyandrous marital patterns women with multiple husbands
6532,Consequentlymales are likely to evolve strategies to compete for them
6533,Sexual selection means that any physical trait or behavioral pattern that increases access to mates will be evolutionarily advantageous
6534,One of the most common competitive strategies for males involves physical size and strength
6535,Likewisedominant males can jealously guard access to multiple females creating harems thatthey defend aggressively
6536,In several species including stickle back fish prairie chickens and elephantseals smaller and nondominant malesdisguise themselves as females to gainaccess to the dominant males territoryand the females within
6537,It is likely elaborate displayrituals that are evident in many birdsreflect behaviors evolved to enhancefemale preference
6538,They can advertise the malessize and strength often in exaggeratedform
6539,They can also attempt to persuadethe female of the resources the male canmake available for child rearing
6540,Forexample male scorpion flies give a high  In the competition for sexual partners many species have adapted in amazing biological and behavioral ways
6541,Peacocksfor instance have evolved so that they have stunning feathersto attract peahens
6542,Handy Psychology     PM  Page calorie gift to their prospective mates
6543,Perhaps the tendency for human males to buy women expensivejewelry and take them out to highpriced restaurants is a related phenomenon
6544,Do females compete for males Although maletomale competition can be very dramatic in the animal world andconsequently has received more attention from sociobiologists femaletofemale competition certainly exists
6545,Some female birds roll other females eggs out of the nest orotherwise interfere with their reproduction
6546,In large monkey troupes for example highstatus females andtheir offspring have many advantages over lower status females
6547,MAJOR MOVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGY So is evolution only about competition Natural selection works on the comparative advantage of genetic traits
6548,Per haps because of this evolutionary theorists have tended to emphasize the competitive nature of social relations
6549,Social behavior in all highly social animals involves much more cooperationthan competition or antagonism
6550,If social life was entirely a Hobbesian freeforall there would be little reason for humans and other animals to seek each otherout
6551,Just as evolution results in competitive and aggressive behavior it alsoresults in the capacity for strong social bonds parental devotion to childrenaffection cooperation empathy in humans at least and many other traits thatsupport cohesive social groups
6552,To say that a behavior had a genetic basis seemed to imply that it was morally desirable orinevitable
6553,Further the emphasis on genetics was seen to invalidate the importance ofenvironment
6554,We now know that environment and genetics interact in almost all ofhuman behavior
6555,While genetics may set the outer limits of behavior environment hashuge influence on the expression of behavior and even on the expression of genes themselves
6556,Genes can be turned on and off according to environmental influences
6557,The proximate cause refers to the imme diate cause of a behavior whether that be hormonal neurological cognitive interpersonal or cultural
6558,For example the proximate cause of humans eating more cookies cake and ice cream involves the psychological tendency to desire and enjoy foodswith high sugar and fat content
6559,This is because one of the most important evolutionarystrategies of human beings involves our remarkably developed intelligence
6560,No otheranimal on earth can learn information of such complexity and modify its behavior insuch diverse ways
6561,Women are supposed to be subordinate to males males are supposed to be aggressive
6562,Therefore it is critical that rigorous scientific research support any claims as to the evolutionary significance of human behavior
6563,In humans twin studies have been used to differentiate the effects of genetics from the effects of environment
6564,Additionally anthropological studies that comparesocial behavior across different cultures are also used in an attempt to separate theeffects of genetics and environment
6565,Monozygotic twins grew from the same fertilized egg andshare  percent of their genes
6566,Dizygotic twins grew from two separate eggs andtherefore share only  percent of their genes
6567,Twins reared together and twins rearedapart have also been compared
6568,MAJOR MOVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGY Studies comparing identical twins fraternal twins and nontwin siblings have been used in an attempt to tease apart the role of genes and environment in various psychological traits  iStock
6569,The assumption is that all psychological processes can be linked to specific patterns of brain activity and that understanding the neurobiological substrates of behav ior can only enhance our understanding of human psychology
6570,With the remarkabletechnological advances of recent years our ability to study the workings of the brainand its relationship to psychological processes has grown at an extremely rapid pace
6571,Modern neuropsychological research helps identify the specific psychological functions that are associatedwith specific patterns of brain activity
6572,For example the encoding of information intolong term memory is mediated by a brain area called the hippocampus
6573,In fact the ethics of animal research is a controversialand difficult area
6574,Studies of animal brains shed important light on the workings ofthe human brain but they also highlight the ways that brains differ across species
6575,This suggests that the frontal lobe grew in size across human evolution as intelligence became an increasingly important evolutionary strategy
6576,Autopsies after death and neuropsychological studies of braininjured patients werethe main methods of neurobiological research
6577,Computerized tomography CT scans and magnetic resonance imagery MRI allowedpictures of brain anatomy
6578,Positron emission tomography PET and single photonemission computed tomography SPECT scans allowed investigation of the actualworkings of the brain via recorded patterns of glucose uptake or blood flow
6579,More recently functional MRI fMRI allows rapidly repeated images of brain activity permitting study of brain activity over time
6580,In effect brain imaging technology has moved from still photos to moving pictures
6581,Moreover subjects can be scannedwhile performing various actions opening up an enormous array of research possibilities that will take many years to fully exploit
6582,Cognitive scientists use tools of evolutionary psychology linguistics computer science philosophy andneurobiology to investigate mental phenomena from a scientific vantage point
6583,The scan includes twenty vertical slices starting from the mans right ear and running through to his left ear
6584,Brain imaging technology allows us to view the wo rkings of a living brain an extraordinary accomplishment possible only in the last few decades  iStock
6585,Cognitive scientists address a broad range of psychological problems including memory language learning and decision making
6586,Out of these investigations many remarkable technological innovations havedeveloped including voice recognition software and advances in robotics
6587,As of yet AI has been restricted to relativelysimple aspects of human psychology such as visual perception and object recognition
6588,Nonetheless AI models have become increasingly sophisticated and have taken on thecomplex problem of learning
6589,The programs are designed to respond to incoming feedback from the outside world
6590,Responsesthat are reinforced are strengthened and those that are not reinforced are weakened
6591,Inthis way AI is similar to the both behaviorist and evolutionary models of psychology
6592,Can the mind be reduced to mathematical equations Computer models of human psychology are based on mathematical rules
6593,As of now there is no definitive answer to this question
6594,Another controversyregarding cognitive science and artificial intelligence involves the concept of qualia
6595,This refers to the subjective quality of a mental process the yellow of yellow the sadness of sad
6596,It is thebread and butter the bricks and mortar of the science of psychology
6597,Research allows Handy Psychology     PM  Page us to study the questions of psychology in a rigorous and systematic way so psychology can be more than a collection of subjective opinions and anecdotal observations
6598,Human behavior is too complex and influenced by too many factors toever presume  percent certainty in our conclusions
6599,Even the best studies dependto some extent on subjective judgments
6600,Therefore we aim for the most rigorousmethods possible accounting for possible confounds biases and limitations in ourresearch
6601,Empirical research is the most rigorous method we have but it is not a crystal ball
6602,Luckily the best way to refute erroneous research is more research
6603,Any trait or behavior that we wish to study is translated into a variable so thatwe can measure it with numbers
6604,We use the term variable because we are studying traits that vary across individuals or across time
6605,If we want to study the relationship between red hair and school achievement we must first operationalize our traits of interest that is turn them into variables
6606,We will code hair color as   red hair  not red hair
6607,We will operationalize school achievement by using grades translating Athrough F into a point scale A   A   A  B   etc
6608,Having translated our traits of interest into numerical variables we can now use mathematics tocalculate the relationships between the variables
6609,This in effect is the nuts and boltsof psychological science
6610,In experimental studies the variables are controlled and manipulated to give the maximum precision to our observations
6611,In an observational study we systemati cally observe behavior in its natural environment
6612,Longitudinal studies observe behavior over a period of time sometimes over decades
6613,Even though quantitative research is the most common form of psychological research qualita tive research has gained more attention recently
6614,MAJOR MOVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGYHandy Psychology     PM  Page Do all psychological studies use numbers Most psychological studies are quantitative and rely on the translation of psychologi cal traits and behaviors into variables that can be analyzed statistically
6615,In qualitative research asmaller number of subjects are observed or interviewed intensively
6616,The observationsare recorded not in numbers but in a long detailed narrative
6617,From these narrativesthe researcher identifies themes that can be explored with greater precision in laterquantitative research
6618,It is more broadbased and openended than quantitative research but lessprecise and reproducible
6619,It is best understood as a preliminary type of research
6620,Starting in the s a series of national and international laws were insti tuted to protect the rights of human subjects in research studies
6621,In  theNuremburg code laid down an international code of ethics regarding humanexperiments
6622,In the s a series of laws was passed in the United States further developing these protections
6623,The establishment of independent reviewboards to oversee the safety and ethics of human research in all Americanresearch institutions dates from this period
6624,Currently Institutional Review Boards IRBs or Human Subjects Review Committees must approve all studies conducted with human subjects
6625,Most academic journals require IRB approval of any study submitted for publication
6626,Once a mathematical equation is identified to explain the behavior of an object the equation can be used to predict the behavior of the object with extraordinary precision
6627,Thus mathematics in the hard sciences is predictive and deterministic
6628,All of the objects behavior can be predicted by the equation
6629,In psychology the topics of study areso complex that it is not possible to predict all human behavior with mathematicalequations
6630,Whether that will ever be possible is debatable but it certainly has not beendone yet
6631,We estimate the likelihood that certain statements are true or not
6632,Further these estimates are based on the aggregate on thebehavior of groups
6633,Therefore while we may be able to say a lot about the likely behavior of groups we are unable to predict the behavior of any given individual with certainty
6634,We cannot study all male college students or all peoplewith schizophrenia so we study a sample of the population of interest and then try toapply our findings to the larger population
6635,For this reason it is critical to make surethe sample is similar to the larger population
6636,There are many ways the sample canvary from the larger population
6637,The way we recruit our study subjects may bias thesample right from the start
6638,For example if you want to study illegal behavior you arelikely to find your sample in the judicial system
6639,Because it is virtually impossible to remove all problems from sampleselection researchers must carefully describe their samples so that the applicability toa larger population or the studys generalizeability can be assessed
6640,Statistics provide a mathematical technique to measure the relationships between two MAJOR MOVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGYHandy Psychology     PM  Page or more variables traits of interest such as intelligence aggression or severity ofdepression
6641,The most common statistics are measures of central tendenciesspecifically the mean median and themode measures of group differencessuch as the ttest ANOVA and MANOVAand measures of covariation such as correlation factor analyses and regressionanalyses
6642,For example height and weight covaryor are correlated while age and ethnicity do not
6643,In general tall people weighmore than shorter people while ethnicitydoes not change with age
6644,It is calculated by dividing the sum of scores by the number of scores
6645,The median refers to the number that falls in the middle of the sample half of the scores lie above it and half lie below
6646,Themedian is not affected by outliers and thus can be a more stable measure of centraltendencies
6647,In this graphthe vast majority of the subjects scored on the low end of thescale while a few people had much higher scores
6648,In a normal distribution the majority of scores are in the middle with a few scores moving outtoward the far ends of either side
6649,Due to a small percentage of people with very large incomes the average or mean income in the United States is higher than the medianincome
6650,The mean onthe other hand is more useful in statistical analyses
6651,If one variable increases at the same time another one increases the twovariables are positively correlated
6652,For example gregariousness and number of friends are well correlated
6653,The more gregarious a person is the more friends they are likely tohave
6654,If one variable increaseswhile another decreases the two variables are negatively correlated
6655,The older someone gets the less likely they are to engagein impulsive behavior
6656,Likewise younger people are more likely to engage in impulsivebehavior
6657,If there is no relationship between variables they have no correlation
6658,We do not anticipate that themonth of birth would have any impact on a persons mathematical ability
6659,There are many ways a study can be biased and it isextremely important to be able to interpret the results of a study critically
6660,Are the results valid or is the study flawed to the extent that the conclusions are not supported by the data Internal validity refers to the integrity of the study methods
6661,Is there a fatal flaw that is intrinsic to the design of thedesign For example a study comparing the effectiveness of two drugs used one drugthat had passed its expiration date
6662,In this case drug B may be less effective than drug Asimply because it passed its expiration date
6663,A study of attitudes toward religion that only includes atheists will have limited external validity
6664,It may be an accuratemeasure of the subjects religious beliefs but the study would not tell us much aboutnonatheists
6665,In general internal validity is more important than external validity
6666,It is a third extraneousvariable that accounts for the relationship between the two variables of interest
6667,Forexample much of the early literature on intelligence tests found that Americans ofnorthern European descent had greater intelligence than immigrants from southern MAJOR MOVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGYHandy Psychology     PM  Page or eastern Europe
6668,These results were confounded by language fluency as the immi grants were not fluent in English
6669,We cannot conclude that the difference in test scores across ethnic groups is due to intelligence if it is confounded by language ability
6670,There are statistical techniques to control for confounds but they are not appropriate in all cases and it is always better if possible to avoid confounds in the first place
6671,They are not concrete objects that are obviously measured like the number of green peas or the height of a giraffe
6672,They are abstract andintangible traits like love or happiness or selfesteem that can neither be seentouched nor counted and may be interpreted differently by different people
6673,Thereforea critical part of psychological research involves the construction of tests that canmeasure psychological traits in a systematic and reliable way
6674,These tests are quick and easy to develop to administer and toscore but they are limited by the likelihood of inaccuracies in the subjects self report
6675,Clinicianadministered questionnaires allow the clinician to make the final scor ing decision based on the subjects responses to each question
6676,Interviews  like questionnaires involve a series of questions administered to the subject but the interviewer has room to follow up each question with probes to obtainmore information or clarify responses
6677,Projective tests like the TAT or the Rorschach ask the subject to complete a task e
6678,Handy Psychology     PM  Page In cognitive tests the subject completes various tasks that involve intellectual skills like memorizing a list of words or arranging blocks to match a pattern
6679,Sensory or motor tasks likewise measure sensory skills such as sensitivity to touch or motor skills such as visualmotor coordination
6680,Tests in these last three categories are often called objective tests because they involve the assessment of objective behavior
6681,The first group of questions measures angerregulation and the second group of questions measures sustained initiative
6682,The questions can either be read aloud by the examiner in an interview format or given to thesubject to fill out as a selfreport questionnaire
6683,I can be really furious about something and then suddenly feel calm and back to normal
6684,Some people have a difficult time getting themselves to do things they either should do or would like to do
6685,Ive had a hard time finishing things Ive started to do
6686,MAJOR MOVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGYHandy Psychology     PM  Page  I arrive at work more than half an hour late
6687,Next the test must be administered to several samples of people to prove that it is a consistent and reliable measure of the construct it isintended to measure
6688,Two critical concepts in test construction are reliability and validity
6689,If theoutcome of a measure varies each time it is applied the measure is not reliable
6690,There are several forms of reliability depending on the format and purpose of the test
6691,Inter item consistency means that the individual items of a test are intercorrelated or they are well related to each other
6692,This isonly useful if the trait measured is unlikely to change much over time
6693,Validity is often measured by correlation with a similar measure of the same construct
6694,For example a depression rating scale could be correlated with another questionnaire that measures depression
6695,Does a group of depressed psychiatric inpatients score higher on the depressionscale than a group of healthy subjects For that matter do the depressed patients scorehigher on the depression scale than a group of inpatients with schizophrenia With con vergent validity  measures of similar constructs will rate the same material similarly
6696,With divergent validitymeasures of different constructs will rate the same material differently
6697,A measure ofdepression should not be well correlated with a measure of happiness
6698,Can you have reliability without validity A test can be reliable without being valid
6699,Although a test can be reliable without being valid it cannotbe valid without being reliable
6700,TheRorschach consists of ten cards with images of inkblots some in blackandwhite andsome with color
6701,Just as people see images in clouds subjects seeimages in the inkblots and they are asked to identify and describe these images
6702,There are no set answers to this test the subjectmust project his or her own thought processes onto the blot in order to make sense ofit
6703,Perhaps because HermanRorschach originally developed his test with inpatient schizophrenics this test is particularly sensitive to psychotic thought process
6704,Claims for thepower of the Rorschach were alsooverblown and poorly supported byempirical research
6705,It was further disparagedbecause of its strong ties to psychoanalysis a discipline also criticized as unscientific
6706,Like the Rorschach psychoanalysisinvolves the identification of emotionalmeaning in ostensibly neutral material
6707,It consists of  cards with evocative and ambiguous drawings involving one or more people
6708,Because the images are ambiguous the subjects storieswill reveal their personal ways of processing interpersonal relationships
6709,Unfortunatelythe TAT has not had the benefit of a John Exner to develop a modern scoring system
6710,Therefore without a reliable and valid scoring system the TAT can only be used qualitatively and only in conjunction with other scientifically supported tests
6711,The original version of the MMPIwas developed in the s
6712,The second edition of the MMPI known as the MMPI iscurrently in use and was last revised in
6713,Eight basic syndrome scales are derivedfrom  selfreport items in a truefalse format
6714,These are Hypochondriasis HysteriaPsychopathic Deviancy Paranoia Psychasthenia Schizophrenia and Mania
6715,Additional scales include MasculinityFemininity Social Introversion and three validity scalesto assess response biases such as underreporting or overreporting
6716,IQ tests have multiplesubtests to tap different kinds of intellectual skills such as memory vocabulary reasoning attention and copying skills
6717,Tests therefore can include lists of vocabularywords to define arithmetic problems or drawings to be copied
6718,All subtests have both Handy Psychology     PM  Page easy and hard items and the items become more difficult as the test goes on
6719,The score is based on the number of items answered correctly
6720,In order toestablish test norms the test is administered to a large sample of people
6721,The average ormean score and the standard deviation are then calculated
6722,Are all the scoresclustered tightly around the mean or are they all spread out If you know both the meanand the standard deviation of a test you can determine the percentile rank of any score
6723,Thus IQ scores reflect a persons percentile rank according to the tests norms
6724,The WAISIV published in  produces a Full Scale IQbased on scores from ten core subtests
6725,These core subtests include Vocabulary Similarities Information Arithmetic Digit Span Block Design Matrix Reasoning Visual Puzzles Digit Symbol and Symbol Search
6726,Five supplemental tests include ComprehensionLetterNumber Sequencing Picture Completion Figure Weights and Cancellation
6727,The Verbal Comprehension Index reflects the ability to express abstractideas in words
6728,The Perceptual Reasoning Index reflects the ability to process visualand spatial information the Working Memory Index suggests the ability to hold andmanipulate information in memory and the Processing Speed Index indicates theability to process information rapidly
6729,Does the WAIS measure intelligence Whether any one test can measure a concept as complex as intelligence has been atopic of considerable controversy
6730,WAIS subtests are also well correlated with many other cognitive tests and with studies on brain activity
6731,Nonetheless there is considerable disagreement as to the exact wayto define intelligence
6732,Loosely we can define intelligence to refer to the ability to processinformation in a way that allows individuals to adapt to their environment
6733,If youlive in a hunting and gathering society your intelligence will have nothing to do withyour ability to read abstract philosophy texts and much more to do with your ability tointerpret your natural surroundings
6734,Likewise an aboriginal Australianfrom the nineteenth century with no formal education would perform extremely poorlyon the WAIS but would have an enormous store of knowledge and skills about survivingin the bush
6735,Because the nature of intelligence is inherently dependent on an individualsenvironment there are chronic problems with cultural bias in intelligence tests
6736,It isarguably impossible to design an intelligence test completely free from cultural bias
6737,This is especially Are IQ tests useful The IQ as measured by the WAIS does a good job of measuring the kinds ofcognitive skills that are useful for functioning in a complex industrialized modern society
6738,The IQ gives a good general sense of the persons overallintellectual performance
6739,Thisprofile can be helpful in diagnosing various neurological or psychiatric conditions such as dementia depression attention deficit disorder or mental retardation
6740,Thus regardless of the persons IQ score the profile of subtests can beenormously helpful for clinical purposes
6741,Handy Psychology     PM  Page important in highly diverse societies such as the United States
6742,The WAISIV includesnonverbal tests such as Block Design andMatrix Reasoning that are not dependent onlanguage and not too dependent on education
6743,Further the use of abstract geometricshapes avoids culturally meaningful images
6744,It is also important to exclude items thatdepend on knowledge that is relevant toonly a small percentage of the population
6745,Anotherimportant way to reduce cultural bias is toprovide norms for different segments of thepopulation
6746,The WAISIV includes normsfor different age groups and many othercognitive tests provide separate norms for people with different levels of education
6747,Finallytranslation of tests into several languages is also very important
6748,Are there other kinds of intelligence that the WAIS doesnt measure If we define intelligence as information processing that allows us to adapt to our environment then the WAIS only taps a narrow range of such skills
6749,Similarly Daniel Goleman has written extensively aboutemotional intelligence  the ability to process emotional and interpersonal information effectively
6750,Folk psychology speaks about street smarts political acumen businesssmarts mechanical aptitude and even common sense
6751,None of these are directly measured on the WAIS although we would assume the visualspatial tests to have somerelationship to mechanical aptitude
6752,Therefore we can conclude that the WAIS measures some aspects ofintelligence that are related but not identical to other aspects of intelligence
6753,The committee concluded that the development of an intelli gence test that could be administered to large groups would be most useful
6754,Potentialsoldiers falling below a cutoff point would be excluded from the military while highscorers could be selected for elite positions
6755,Under the guidance of Robert Yerkes a Harvard psychologist and army major the Army Alpha a written test and the Army Beta a pictorial version for the  percent ofsoldiers unable to read the written test were developed
6756,These tests had broad impacton the discharge and promotion of soldiers
6757,The use of such tests in WWI spawned anexplosion of intelligence and aptitude tests after the war to be used in schools the military and other institutions
6758,Further many questions were moralistic as if disagreement with AngloAmerican values reflected lower intelligence
6759,Despite these verylegitimate complaints it must be kept in mind that intelligence tests aimed for ameritbased approach to job placement
6760,In this way the army at least tried to be moredemocratic than the explicitly prejudiced family and classbased approaches toemployment that were typically used before
6761,Todays intelligence and aptitude testsaim for much greater cultural sensitivity
6762,Nonetheless it is arguably impossible todevelop a test that is completely cultureneutral
6763,In keeping with Wilhelm Wundts studies ofsensation and perception his initial intelligence tests comprised various measures ofhand grip reaction time to sensory stimuli and other sensorymotor skills
6764,James Cattell carried this work forward and developed an intelligence test based on Galtons work
6765,In his position as professor of psychology at Columbia University he administered his test to hundreds of college freshmen
6766,Perhaps this was the beginning of a longtradition of using college freshmen in psychological research
6767,By  he had sufficient data to correlate students grades with their intelli gence test results
6768,To his great disappointment there was no relationship at allbetween the two variables
6769,We might attribute these negative findings to two factors alack of construct validity such that psychophysical measures have no relationship atall to academic performance and restriction of range
6770,College freshmen at an eliteuniversity will not vary that much in intelligence so some correlations with intelligence may be masked by this fact
6771,While observing his own children develop newcognitive skills as they grew Binet recognized that intelligence could be measureddevelopmentally
6772,They did this through multiple administrations and refinements of their measure giving the test both to children of normal intelligence and those identified as mentallyretarded
6773,The first version of their test was published in  with several revisions following in quick succession
6774,By providing the expected scores for each age in the edition Binet and Simon created the first empirically validated standardized test
6775,Within a few years the BinetSimon test had spread to countries on five continents
6776,Terman  at Stanford University revised and refined the BinetSimon test to increase its sensitivity at the higher end of the scale
6777,The StanfordBinettest published in  was the first test to use IQ scores
6778,An IQ score or intelligencequotient is derived from a large sample of test results
6779,Terman set the mean IQ score at and the standard deviation at
6780,By translating raw scores into IQ scores the percentile rank of each score could be calculated
6781,For example an IQ score of  falls inthe th percentile of  in the
6782,The StanfordBinet was the primary IQ test used for many decades and is currently inits fifth edition
6783,Histests had more to do with physical coordination and strength than intelligence and assuch had no construct validity
6784,Later tests also had problems with validity but thesewere more subtle
6785,For the most part they were extremely culturally biased servingthe antiimmigrant bias of the first several decades of the twentieth century
6786,Here thebiggest problem was generalizeability meaning the applicability of the test to a largerpopulation
6787,There was no consideration of Englishspeaking ability or of culturally rel MAJOR MOVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGYHandy Psychology     PM  Page evant knowledge
6788,Some items only measured knowledge available to wealthy English speaking and nativeborn Americans
6789,Alcmaeon of Croton identified the brain as the physical seat of the mind
6790,Twentyfive hundred years later modern science has proven this ancient Greek to be absolutely correct
6791,There is no aspect of psychology that is independent ofthe brain
6792,The very essence of our humanityour thoughts our feelings our beliefsand our valuesall emerge from this threepound lump of gray tissue
6793,Psychology hasno choice but to take the brain into consideration
6794,Moreover with the remarkableadvances of neuroscience in the last few decades we now know more about the brainand its relationship to the mind than at any other time in human history
6795,For one the brain is believedto carry traces of its evolutionary origins deep within its tissues
6796,Secondly the brain has evolvedup and out so that the lowest and deepest parts of the brain are the oldest
6797,The outermost uppermost and the furthest forward brain regions are the youngest on the evolutionary scale
6798,Theolder structures tend to be simpler and more primitive both in their anatomy and inthe behavioral functions they control
6799,Are there any costs In general complexity allows for more flexibility
6800,Complexsystems take more energy and are more fragile than simpler systems
6801,With more partsinvolved it is easier for something to go wrong
6802,In other words it uses up to tentimes as much of the bodys resources as would be expected for its weight
6803,As the brain is a threedimensional structure specific terms are used to distinguish up from down backfrom front and inside from outside
6804,The terms anterior andposterior are used to refer to front and back respectively as are the Latin words rostral and caudal
6805,Superior and inferior refer to top and bottom respectively as do the Latin words dorsal and ventral
6806,Lateral refers to outside while medial refers to the inside
6807,Rostral and caudal are the Latin words for head and tail
6808,Likewise dorsaland ventral refer to the back and belly of a body as in the dorsal fin of a shark
6809,Medial means close to the bodys midline while lateral means away from it
6810,To say something is phylogenetically old means that is old in evolutionary terms
6811,Although the use of animals in biological research raises moral questionsabout animal rights there is no question that much of our knowledge about thehuman brain derives from research on animal brains
6812,Legally and ethically we canperform much more invasive procedures on animal brains than we can on livinghuman brains
6813,Additionally comparison of the brains of many different kinds of animals gives us critical insight into brain evolution
6814,The outer layer of the brain is called the cortex or the neocortex
6815,Itis a wrinkled surface that covers the top and sides of the brain
6816,This is the part thatlooks like a boxing glove albeit a wrinkled one
6817,The basal ganglia are also in the middle of thebrain close to the thalamus
6818,The cortex is a relatively recent evolutionary achievement and the corticalstructures are much more developed in humans than they are in more primitive animals
6819,Most of the more complex psychological processes the ones we think of asuniquely human such as language abstract thought and reading are controlled bythe cortex
6820,The subcortical regions process more fundamental psychological and evenphysiological functions
6821,The lowest parts of the brain closest to the spinal cord arethe oldest parts and regulate physiological processes we share with more primitiveanimals such as breathing heartbeat and digestion
6822,The rounded parts of the convolutions arecalled gyri gyrus in the singular
6823,The grooves between the gyri are called sulci sulcus in the singular
6824,The more neurons we have the more powerfully we can processinformation
6825,To illustrate this efficient use of space imagine an accordion or pleatedpaper fan first folded up and then stretched out from end to end
6826,The frontal lobe comprises the front half of the cortex
6827,The thumblike segments of the cortex are the temporal lobes
6828,The parietal lobes cover much of the back surface of the cortex extending from thecentral sulcus back to the border with the occipital lobe the parietooccipital sulcus
6829,Finally the occipital lobes are at the lower back end of the cortex
6830,It covers about half the humancortex and is the most recently evolved part of the brain
6831,More specifically it mediatesour executive functions  a group of psychological functions that serve to control our behavior
6832,These include planning abstract thought impulse control and the controlof behavioral sequences
6833,As might be imagined impairment in these areas can lead tosignificant problems functioning in the world
6834,The most posterior region of the frontal lobe iscalled the motor strip and is involved with intentional movements
6835,AdditionallyBrocas area on the left posterior side of the frontal lobe mediates speech productionor the translation of thought into spoken words
6836,The parietal lobe processes bothtouch and taste in the somatosensory strip and the temporal lobes are involved withhearing
6837,Additionally the parietal lobes are involved with attention and visualspatialinformation while the temporal lobes mediate language memory and the recognitionof familiar objects

6839,He first divided the cortex into distinctregions based on the way neurons were organized cytoarchitecture
6840,Nonetheless there is still variation in the terms used as many brain structures have several different names
6841,Handy Psychology     PM  Page Do both sides of the brain do the same thing The two halves of the brain are almost but not quite identical
6842,With regard to the cor tex there is considerable difference in the functions they perform
6843,This differencebetween right and left sides of the brain is called lateralization
6844,The left side of the cortex is involved with language comprehension and speech production
6845,The rightside of the brain is involved with spatial and emotional processing and facial recognition
6846,Because of lateralization the impact of brain damage for example due to strokewill differ depending on the side of the brain affected
6847,The term was first introduced by JamesPapez in  and refers to a group of brain structures in the middle of the brain
6848,Theoriginal Papez circuit included the hippocampus the fornix the mammilary bodiesthe anterior nucleus of the thalamus and the cingulate gyrus
6849,Over time the boundaries of the limbic system were expanded although the exact definition of the limbicsystem is still not universal
6850,These regions are all involved with emotional and motivational processing
6851,Because of its oval shape the amygdala was named after the Greek word for almond
6852,For example imagine that a vicious dog hasbroken free of its leash and is now lunging toward you
6853,Early brain anatomists believed it looked more Handy Psychology     PM  Page like a seahorse and named it after the Greek word for seahorse hippo  horse
6854,While the hippocampus does not process emotion per se it is located near the other limbic structures and carries memories of emotionally meaningful events
6855,The cingulate gyrus is a long structure that wraps around numerous other subcortical regions and has attentional emotional and cognitive functions
6856,The basal ganglia are actually a group of brain regions including the putamen globus pallidusand caudate nucleus
6857,This part of the brain is relatively old phylogenetically and handles the more automatic aspects of behavior
6858,Damage to the basal ganglia can severely disrupt motor behavioras is found in neurological diseases likeParkinsons or Huntingtons disease
6859,It regulatesbasic physiological processes necessaryfor life such as breathing temperatureregulation sleepwake cycle and cardiacfunction
6860,The brain stem has been relatively conserved across evolution andtherefore does not dramatically differacross animal species
6861,These parts of the brain are most developed in more complex and evolutionarilyyounger mammals such as primates
6862,The reptilian area of the brain refers tothe brain stem and the cerebellum phylogenetically ancient regions that are found insome of the most ancient and primitive species e
6863,Although MacLeanstriune model has been criticized as overly simplistic it does provide a useful way fornonspecialists to picture the brain
6864,The entire brain is actually a huge network of interlocking interacting neurons
6865,There are about one hundred billion neurons in the human brain and several times that amount of glial andother smaller cells that support neuronal function
6866,A neuron is composed of a cell body an axon and a profusion of branching dendrites
6867,Dendrites are the treelike extensions that reach out from the cellbody
6868,They are the input section of thecell and carry electrical information intothe cell body from the axons of otherneurons
6869,Axons are the output section of the cell and carry electrical informationfrom the cell out to other neurons
6870,Axonscan be extremely long reaching from thebrain all the way down to the base of thespine
6871,While some axons branch into twosections by and large there is only oneaxon per neuron
6872,At the end of the axonthe cell branches into numerous axonterminals
6873,The majority of axonterminals connect with the dendrites ofother cells resulting in trillions of neuronal connections in the typical brain
6874,The neuron sending the message is called the pre synaptic neuron while the neuron receiving the message is the postsynaptic neuron
6875,The gap between the neurons is called the synaptic cleft
6876,Some of these neurotransmitters are excitatory and others are inhibitory
6877,Both types of neurotransmitters change the electrical charge of the postsynaptic neuron
6878,Excitatory neurotransmitters make it easier for the postsynaptic BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR This computer graphic illustrates the basic structure of a neuron

6881,In this waywide networks of neurons communicatewith each other in very little time
6882,Actionpotentials commonly travel at speeds of meters per second and can occurevery fivehundredth of a millisecond
6883,Because myelinated axons are white in appearance brain tissue made up of these fibers is called white matter
6884,In contrast grey matter refers to brain tissue made up of dendrites and cell bodies as well as glial cells and capillaries
6885,The surface of the cortex is composed of grey matter
6886,For one our brain has become much larger relative to our body size
6887,Evolutionarily older and more primitive animals have much smaller brains relative to theirbody size
6888,Think of the dinosaurs with their tiny brains and huge bodies

6891,Handy Psychology     PM  Page brains are about three times the size of the brains of our closest relative the chim panzee although our bodies are not much bigger than theirs
6892,It is less the size of an animals brain that determines its intelligence than the complexity of its neuronal networks
6893,The neocortex the sixlayer tissue that forms the outer layer of the humanbrain is found only in mammals
6894,Primitive cortices are evident in smaller mammalssuch as hares opossums and armadillos and more developed cortices are evident inhigherorder mammals such as elephants dogs and dolphins
6895,The cortex allows for much more sophisticated processing of sensory information e
6896,It also allows for more variedand flexible behavioral responses to internal and external stimulation
6897,Do the different brain regions ever perform redundant functions  In some cases the cortex and subcortical areas provide redundant or overlappingfunctions
6898,For example both the frontal lobe and the basal ganglia regulate motorbehavior
6899,But the behavior regulated by the basal ganglia is relatively crude and inflexible
6900,Although fast and efficient it is not easily adapted to changing conditions
6901,Behavior regulated by the frontal lobe on the other hand is much more nuanced flexibleand responsive to changing conditions
6902,Has the frontal lobe grown across human evolution The greatest change in brain structure across human evolution relates to thefrontal lobe
6903,Frontal lobes are tiny in many smaller mammals such as tree shrewsand hedgehogs
6904,In higherorder mammals like cats and dogs they are still smallerthan in humans and also considerably less convoluted
6905,As mentioned above theconvolutions on the cortex provide more surface area for dendrites to expand
6906,Relatedly our species has the most complex and sophisticated cognitive capacitieson earth
6907,That is not to say that other animals do not use some form of thoughtchimpanzees use tools to solve problems and gorillas can be taught the rudimentsof language
6908,Nonetheless as far as we know no other species really comes close tous with regard to intelligence
6909,In many mammals the olfactory bulb is a major portion ofthe entire brain
6910,In fact it is present in even the most primitive vertebrates suchas fish
6911,In humans it is a tiny little orb sandwiched between our limbic system andthe bottom of our frontal lobe
6912,This contrast illustrates our reduced reliance onthe sense of smell in favor of vision hearing and analytic thinking all functionssupported by the cortex
6913,The Australopithecus genus was one of the earliest forms ofhominids
6914,The homo genus followed with several species such as Homo habilis Homo erectus and Homo sapien neanderthalensis neanderthals preceding or even overlap ping with modern humans
6915,Therefore paleontologists must workwith skeletal remains using skulls andother bone fragments to draw inferencesabout the biology and behavior of earlyhominids
6916,Estimat ing from skull size and shape Homo habilis had a brain size of  to  cubic cen timeters cc and Homo erectus about  to  cubic centimeters
6917,Homo sapien sapiens modern humans have a brain size of about  cubic centimeters
6918,Concur rent with the increase in brain size paleontologists find an increase in the complexityof tools found with hominid remains
6919,Additionally larger brained hominids were adapted to morevaried andor harsher climates
6920,Has the frontal lobe increased Along with the increase in skull size the shape of the skull also suggests enlargementof the brain and of the frontal lobe in particular
6921,There is a prominent jaw a small sloping forehead anda relatively small brain casing
6922,Modern humans in contrast have flatter faces verysteep foreheads and small jaws
6923,Likewise our brain casing is greatly enlargedrelative to the rest of our skull
6924,Is there evidence of language in hominid skulls  Indentations on the inside of Homo habilis skulls  Homo habilis lived about two million years ago suggest an enlarged area around the location of Brocas area a central regionfor speech production in modern humans
6925,While we cannot know if this area was connected to speech in Homo habilis brains we can suggest that at least a precursor to modern language regions of the brain was present at a very early point in hominid evolution
6926,One fairly easy way for genetic mutations to produce physical changes in theanimal is to adjust the timing of maturation
6927,There is evidence that many advances in human evolutioninvolve pedomorphy
6928,For example we are one of the few mammals that retain a high levelof playfulness throughout adulthood
6929,Secondly the shape of our skull mirrors that ofjuvenile apes
6930,The skulls of juvenile chimpanzees look more like the skulls of adulthumans than the skulls of adult chimpanzees
6931,Adult chimpanzees have small sloping foreheads prominent jaws and more horizontallyaligned faces
6932,Adult humans on the otherhand have high foreheads small jaws and flat verticallyaligned faces similar to juve BRAIN AND BEHAVIORHandy Psychology     PM  Page niles of both species
6933,Of note juvenile chimpanzees have a larger brain to skull ratio than do adult chimpanzees
6934,Phylogeny refers to evolution and ontogeny to development across the lifespan
6935,Haeckel believed that every stage in the development of a human embryo exactly parallels the stages of human evolution
6936,there was no cow stage inhuman evolution this theory oversimplified the processes of embryonic development
6937,While Haeckels specific theory has been discredited he was correct in pointing outimportant parallels between evolution and maturation
6938,Careful understanding of ourdevelopment across the lifespan does offer some clues as to our evolutionary history
6939,In their earliest stages of embryonic development a flat plate is formed composed of three layers the ectoderm mesoderm and endoderm
6940,Cells in certain sections divide more quickly than cells in adjacent areascausing the layers of cells to buckle and fold
6941,In this way curves and bends are formedand the different parts of the body begin to take shape
6942,After an initial period of furious cell division some cells are created that are post mitotic that is they stop dividing
6943,These cells begin the fascinating process of migratingto their final destination
6944,They do so by means of molecular and cellular signposts thatguide their progress
6945,After the cells arrive at their proper place neuronal connectionsmust be established
6946,Axons are then sent out to travel across broad swaths of territory tocreate synaptic connections with other cells
6947,Their journey throughout the brain is alsodirected by chemical signals that point them toward their destination
6948,The establishmentof specific synaptic connections between neurons is partially controlled by genetic factorsduring pregnancy
6949,At the head of the neural plate three bulges form dis Handy Psychology     PM  Page tinct sections
6950,These are called the forebrain the midbrain and the hindbrain also known as the prosencephalon the mesencephalon and the rhombencephalon
6951,The table below lists the parts of the neural tube
6952,These two sections subsequently develop into the cerebellum and pons on one hand and the medulla oblongata on the other
6953,The pons and medulla oblongata are both part of the brain stem
6954,Together with the cerebellum they form the reptilian brain of PaulMacLeans triune model
6955,These deep brain structures lie just above the brain stem
6956,In primitive vertebrates such as amphibiansfish and reptiles the tectum serves as the main visual processing center in the brain
6957,In primates its function is more restricted as the majority of visual processing is donein the neocortex
6958,The cerebral peduncle includes several brain areasthat contain the neurons that produce important neurotransmitters
6959,For example thesubstantia nigra is the origin of a major tract of dopamine neurons
6960,The forebrain divides into the dien cephalon and the telencephalon
6961,In MacLeans model the forebrain includes both the paleomammalian and the neomammalian brains
6962,It is the relay station between thesense organs and their corresponding cortical regions
6963,Olfaction smell is the onlysense modality that does not run through the thalamus as it is processed directly bythe olfactory bulb
6964,The hypothalamus links the brain to the autonomic nervous system and serves a critical role in emotion connecting the mental aspects of emotionwith the bodys physical response
6965,Although present inall vertebrates it is most developed in birds and mammals
6966,In humans the telencephalon develops into the cerebral cortex the limbic system the basal ganglia and important white matter regions
6967,The cerebral cortex includes the four lobes of the neocortex as well as those areas on the inside surface of the cortex that directly contact the subcortical regions
6968,The basal ganglia amygdala and septum also develop out of the telencephalon
6969,Finallycerebral white matter is made up of bundles of axons that travel across large sections of the brain
6970,Important cerebralwhite matter structures that develop outof the telencephalon include the anteriorcommissure the internal capsule andthe corpus callosum
6971,For  Given the extraordinary journey that brain cells must travel during fetal development it is amazing that so many babiesare born without brain damage  iStock
6972,Handy Psychology     PM  Page example spina bifida is linked to defects in the neural tube
6973,In fact serious problems in the first trimester of pregnancy often lead to miscarriage such that  percent of miscarriagesoccur in the first trimester
6974,Theincrease in weight is mainly due to growth in dendritic branches
6975,This is because thebasic structures of the brain are in place at birth but the connections between neurons are still under developed
6976,In otherwords the firing of neurons greatly influences the creation and strengthening of synaptic connections
6977,As the saying goes Neurons that fire together wire together
6978,New dendrites are formed thickening the dendritic branches of the neuron
6979,As the very development of our brain is dependent upon our experience we can say that the human brain is very plastic
6980,In fact brain development inhumans is more experiencedependent than in any other species reflecting thecentral role our capacity to learn has played in human evolution
6981,Handy Psychology     PM  Page sites on the post synaptic neuron the dendrite
6982,These new receptor sites increase sensitivity to the neurotransmitters released into the synaptic cleft
6983,Activation of synaptic connections strengthens the connections but lack of activation causes these connections to dieoff
6984,The atrophy or dying off of unused connections is known as pruning
6985,In short thebrain has a use it or lose it policy
6986,For example a baby is born with the capacity to recognize all sounds of all languages on earth
6987,Eventually the childs brain has been wired torespond only to its own native language
6988,Although a strong capacity to learn new languages is retained throughout childhood receptivity to new languages decreases with age
6989,The peak of synaptic growth occurs within the first two years of life but synaptogenesis continues at a rapid pace for the firstten years of life
6990,In fact the average lifespan in the United States has increased years over the course of the twentieth century
6991,In the coming decades thereforewe can expect far more people to live into their seventies eighties and ninetiesthan ever before
6992,Nutritious meals regular exercise and avoidance ofexcessive alcohol weight gain and smoking are all important
6993,Good mental health is also important as depression and excessive stress put strain on the brain
6994,Mentally active people with good social support are morelikely to be happy and physically more active
6995,Furthermore you should not waituntil you retire to start healthy behavior
6996,At any given time our brain reflects our entire lifetime of experience
6997,Handy Psychology     PM  Page years of lifea child learns to walk talk manipulate objects and begins to understand the social worldit is not surprising that this is a peak period of braingrowth
6998,Children also remain extremelyopen to learning throughout the firstdecade they learn to ride bicycles followsocietal rules and read and write
6999,Ifthese tasks are not learned in childhoodit becomes much more difficult to learnthem later on
7000,The myelination of axon fibers is not well developed at birth
7001,Myelination continues throughout childhood and myelination of the frontal lobe is not complete untilthe third decade of life
7002,In fact thefrontal lobe does not complete synaptic formation and myelination until the midtwenties
7003,In this regard ontogeny does recapitulate phylogeny in both developmentand evolution the frontal lobe is a late comer
7004,This is entirely consistent with our BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR As the rest of the body ages so does the brain
7005,The good news is that there are things everyone can do to keep both yourmind and body healthier for longer periods of time  iStock
7006,Handy Psychology     PM  Page observations about the intellectual abilities and social judgment of children and ado lescents
7007,While many brain functions such as physical coordination and languageabilities are fully mature by adolescence social judgment and abstract thought takeconsiderably longer to mature
7008,The maturebrain has trillions of synapses forming neural networks of extraordinary complexity
7009,This complexity allows for much greater intellectual power and sophistication
7010,Although children have an advantage over adults in their ability to take in and retainnew information adults maintain a profound advantage over children in their abilityto process complex information
7011,Thus while childrens brains may be little spongesadult brains permit much greater understanding of the world around them
7012,Nonethelessthe more you perform an action think a thought or feel a feeling the more those circuits are reinforced
7013,As such the use it or loseit adage holds across the lifespan
7014,Of course core circuitry that is laid down in childhood is conservative and difficult to change
7015,There is an overall decrease in the speed flexibility and efficiency of neuronal networks
7016,There is atrophy and shrinking of many parts of the brain
7017,Much can be done to preserve brain health in aging
7018,Thegyri convolutions shrink the sulci grooves between gyri and the ventricles vesselsfilled with cerebral spinal fluid expand and there is about a  percent decrease inbrain weight in both sexes by age eighty
7019,Handy Psychology     PM  Page Do cells die Brain cells seem to have a preprogrammed life span and cell death occurs throughout the life span
7020,This mayaccount for some of the atrophy of cerebral gray matter
7021,These changes correspond with decreased processingspeed working memory and psychomotor speed and a reduced ability to commit newinformation to memory
7022,Recognition memory verbal skills conceptual abilities and general IQstay stable for a long time despite decreases in speed and raw processing power
7023,Crystallized intelligence involves verbal skills conceptual skills and fund of knowledge
7024,Are there any benefits of an aging brain Although reductions in processing speed and memory efficiency are evident by middleage there are some ways the brain improves with age
7025,By the seventh or eighth decadeof life a lifetime of experience is encoded in the brains neural networks
7026,A lifetime ofsynaptic strengthening suggests better connectivity across the brain better integration of different brain areas
7027,Moreover enhanced cortical control of limbic responsessupports a more thoughtful response to emotion
7028,brain tissue and the elderly may become considerably constricted in their independent functioning
7029,Can the brain regenerate For a long time it was simply assumed that there was no production of new neuronsafter birth
7030,Certain areas ofthe brain such as the hippocampus an area critical for memory formation producenew neurons throughout adulthood
7031,We also know that dendritic branching andsynaptic development can occur throughout the lifespan
7032,Neurogenesis the creation of new neurons can be bolstered by physical exercise diet appropriate levels of restand relaxation mental stimulation and by certain medications such as antidepressants that act on the neurotransmitter known as serotonin
7033,Thus the cardinal feature of Alzheimers is loss of memory
7034,As the disease progresses other areas of the brain are affected and other psychoHandy Psychology     PM  Page BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR logical abilities deteriorate including spatial orientation executive functions and eventually speech
7035,While it is one of the mostcommon forms of dementia it is not the only one and other dementias such as vascular dementia can also cause cognitive decline in old age
7036,At present many neuroscientists have agreed to put the question of qualia aside
7037,From the brain stem up to the cortex the brain processes information likea very detailed mapmaker
7038,The brain passes information upstream in steps movingfrom the lowerlevel more simply organized regions to the higherlevel more complex regions
7039,At each step the new region maps the neural firing patterns of theregion below
7040,It does this by recreating the spatial layout of the neurons of the otherHandy Psychology     PM  Page region
7041,In this way the brain builds a series of representations of both internal and external reality
7042,They help the brain toregulate the internal states of the body respond to objects in the environment andrespond to the neural patterns underlying our own thoughts and emotions
7043,Nerves originating in the skin muscles skeletal system blood vessels and viscera internal organs all connect to neurons in the brain stem
7044,The firing patterns ofthese nerves are then mirrored in the firing patterns of the brain stem neurons
7045,Inthis way the brain forms a representation of the internal state of the body and thisrepresentation is updated on a momentbymoment basis
7046,Likewise some types ofsensory information such as sound and touch are sent to the brain stem in the initialstages of perception
7047,By coordinating information from so many diverse areasof the brain the frontal lobe can map both internal and external reality in great detail
7048,These maps are then linked viamemory to similar maps drawn from past experience
7049,This allows us to classify theimages into known categories for example furniture food or animal
7050,People withinjuries to the visual association cortex will be blind in the conventional sense ofthe word
7051,They will not be able to recognize any objects visually
7052,This suggests that fundamental information about the presenceand location of visual stimuli does get through
7053,At this point we recognizethat the pattern of light waves hitting our retina is actually a chair
7054,Thus sensationworks by analysisby breaking down information into its smallest parts
7055,This might come in the form of light waves or sound waves or physical pressureagainst our skin
7056,This information is picked up by our sense organs for example oureyes ears nose skin or tongue
7057,Our sense organs then relay this information to theprimary sensory cortices via the thalamus
7058,The thalamus acts as a gating station blocking information it identifies as unimportant and passing on information it deemsimportant
7059,The primary visual cortex is in the occipital lobe the primary auditory hearing cortex is in thetemporal lobe and the primary sensory cortex for touch and taste is in the parietallobe
7060,The primary sensory cortex is known as the somatosensory strip
7061,Does the brain also process sensory information from inside our bodies Sensory information does not only come from outside the body
7062,We also need sensoryinformation about the state of our body
7063,We need to know if we are feeling dizzy or sick toour stomachs or if our heart is beating fast
7064,This tells us important information about ourhealth but also tells us about our emotions
7065,In fact there are neurons throughout the gastrointestinal systemso many that it is sometimes called oursecond brain
7066,The brain stem somatosensory strip and insula a cortical area on the insideof the cortex are involved with processing sensory information from inside our body
7067,As mentioned above the brain constructs its own version of reality by constructing a map of the world around it
7068,In the primary sensory cortices neurons respond to patterns of stimulation for example with cells that fire inresponse to horizontal vertical or diagonal lines
7069,In this way the brain constructs an interpretation or map of reality that is deeply connected to our personal experience and history
7070,The visual associationcortex is in the occipital lobe just anterior to the primary visual cortex
7071,The auditoryassociation cortex is in the temporal lobe close to the primary auditory cortex
7072,Theassociation cortex for touch is next to the somatosensory strip in the parietal cortex inthe brain regions known as S and S
7073,For example information about the sightof a chair as well as the sound and the feel of your body as you sit down in it is coordinated into the unified perception of a single object
7074,Simultaneously activation of thehippocampus and parts of the temporal cortex jog our memory allowing us to place Handy Psychology     PM  Page our perception in the context of our memories
7075,Do different people perceive the same event differently As mentioned above the brain does notrecord reality like a camera it constructsa representation of reality through analysis and synthesis of sensory information
7076,Even if the samesensory information is available to twodifferent people the unique history ofeach persons brain will ensure that thefinal perception of each individual will differ colored by variations in the individuals attention memories emotionalstates etc
7077,Moreover the exact sensoryinformation in any given event will neverbe identical for any two people becausethe position in space of each persons body will necessarily differ
7078,All these factors willcontinue to color the memory of the event at later times
7079,This is well understood inlegal contexts and is the reason that eye witness testimony can be highly problematic
7080,The processing of visual information starts inthe eyes the visual sense organs
7081,On the retina the inner back surface of the eyethere are a number of neurons that are specialized to fire in response to light
7082,Rods respond to night vision and process infor mation in shades of black white and gray
7083,The optic nerve exits through the back of the retina and travels to the brain
7084,All the ganglion cells that respond to the right side of the visual field will go to the leftside of the brain
7085,Likewise the ganglion cells that respond to the left side of the visualfield will go to the right side of the brain
7086,The external world that people see and hearand touch and smell is interpreted differently as it is filteredthrough each individuals emotions memories and cognitiveprocesses iStock
7087,Handy Psychology     PM  Page to the opposite side of the brain is able to do so at the optic chiasm in the middle of the brain
7088,The two branches of the optic nerve next connect to the correspondinglobes of the thalamus
7089,Basedon feedback from the cortex the thalamus lets some information through to activateneurons connected to the cortex but stops other messages in their tracks
7090,Neurons inthe thalamus send visual information up to the primary visual cortex in the occipitallobe known as VI or Brodman area
7091,From there the fundamental features of thevisual stimulus are processed
7092,The outer flap that we normally think of as the ear is called the pinna
7093,The ear canal ends in the ear drum a thin membrane that stretches across the backend of the ear canal
7094,The middle ear consists of three tiny delicate bones that transfersound vibrations from the ear drum to the cochlea a fluidfilled spiral that translatessound vibrations into neural activity
7095,Sound vibrations are captured bythe pinna channeled back to the middle ear by the ear canal and communicated tothe cochlea via the bones of the middle ear
7096,The fluidfilled cochlea is lined with hair cells a type of sensory neuron that responds to sounds of specific frequencies
7097,This bizarrely specific disorder is due to lesionsin the fusiform gyrus  a multimodal association region that is located at the bot tom of the temporal lobe
7098,Handy Psychology     PM  Page pitched sounds are recorded by hair cells at the opening of the spiral cochlea middle frequencies in the middle of the cochlea and low frequencies by hair cells at the end ofthe spiral
7099,Here the auditory information is processed for thetiming and intensity
7100,Finally the auditory information enters the cortex at the primaryauditory cortex A located in the superior and posterior upper rear temporal lobe
7101,Association areas are nearby including the regions that deal with language
7102,People can hear voices talking to themsometimes a single voice sometimes an entire chorus of voices
7103,In this way the brain actually ishearing voices although the sensory information does not come from the ear but from inside the persons brain
7104,It is believed that hallucinatory voices actually derive from the persons thoughts
7105,While inner speech is a common phenomenon healthy brains can distinguish between inner speech and spoken words
7106,For reasons we do not fully understandantipsychotic medication restores theability to make the critical distinctionbetween imagined and external reality
7107,Our entire skin functions as the sensory organ for touch
7108,Handy Psychology     PM  Page sense changes in physical pressure some to vibrations some to pain and others to temperature
7109,These neurons send information to the cortex via a fairly long pathwayrunning through the spinal cord areas in the mid brain and the thalamus
7110,The primary sensory area for touch is called the somatosensory strip S in the anterior frontarea of the parietal lobe
7111,Neurons responding to touch on different areas of the body aremapped along the somatosensory strip
7112,This map is known as the homunculus little man in Latin
7113,The olfactory nerve connects the olfactory receptor cells in the nose to the olfactory bulbs two small structures on either side of the brain just below the frontal lobe
7114,From the olfactorybulbs axons bundled together into the olfactory nerves project to various parts ofthe limbic system
7115,From there neurons connect to other subcortical areas such asthe thalamus hypothalamus and insula
7116,Thus the olfactory nerve sends information directly to the emotional centers of the brain without the filtering role of thethalamus or the cortex
7117,The olfactory bulb plays a much larger role in simpler andphylogenetically older animals than it does in phylogenetically younger and morecomplex animals like primates
7118,If yousever the olfactory nerve removing the sense of smell your ability to taste your foodwill be much reduced
7119,You will only be able to taste sweet bitter salt and sour flavors
7120,This is a Japanese word meaning delicious savory or meaty
7121,Umamiseems related to monosodium glutamate MSG a food additive used extensively inEast Asian cuisine
7122,Sweet umami and salty tastes enhance our intake of carbohydrate protein and salt respectively
7123,Excessive amountsof bitter or sour taste alert us to decaying or toxic food
7124,The relative amounts of thetaste qualities of any food put in the mouth are sensed by the taste buds gustatory papillae tiny protrusions that cover the surface of the tongue
7125,These project or connect to a particular area in thesomatosensory strip specialized for the tongue
7126,Ourphysical behavior ranges from simple reflexive movements up to intentional plannedand complex movements
7127,Examples include walking standing up raising our arm getting dressed shakingour head etc
7128,Involuntary movements are those movements that are not under con scious control or that generally happen automatically without conscious thought
7129,Involuntary movements are processed largely through a group of brain cells known as extra pyramidal neurons
7130,They connect input from the cerebellum and the inner ear to the brain stem
7131,The first two areas process information about coordination and balance
7132,Thus information related to involuntary movement doesnot go through the cortex and generally travels in a relatively simple closed circuit
7133,Thiscan result in disfiguring side effects such as tardive dyskinesia a syndrome characterized by tremors in the extremities and facial muscles
7134,The atypical antipsychotics anew class of medication have now become popular because they produce fewer extrapyramidal side effects e
7135,Goals for physical action areprocessed in the prefrontal cortex the seat of planning and goal setting
7136,Coordination of the specific movements appears to take place in these areas
7137,The surface of the body is mapped along M creating a similar homunculus tothe one found next door in the somatosensory strip
7138,This region is linked to the actualexecution of the movement
7139,Does information only move in one direction It is important to understand that the brain is continuously giving and receiving feedback
7140,Information is always moving up and down the system and modifying both inputand output
7141,For example the motor system sends out a signal to move and the lefthand reaches out to grasp a glass
7142,The hand is too far to the left of the glass the pinky finger brushesagainst the back of a chair
7143,This feedback is automatically incorporated into the ongoing movement and the hand is moved half an inch to the right
7144,The impact of this newmovement is then encoded into new sensory information
7145,For the sake of simplicityour sensory and motor systems are presented here as if they act in isolation
7146,In realitythough the brain is a giant web of interacting systems giving itself constant feedback
7147,With rich connections to both the frontal lobe and the brainstem it is integrally involved in motor control
7148,The cerebellum mediates motor coordination posture and the smooth flow of movement
7149,Damage to the cerebellum results injerky uncoordinated movements and problems with balance
7150,More recent research hasrevealed that the cerebellum is involved with a range of cognitive functions as well
7151,Is imagined movement different than actual movement Surprisingly the brain processes observed movement and imagined movement inmuch the same way it processes actual movement
7152,Such an experi ence can be very distressing as itcompounds an already devastatingloss
7153,Neurons inthe spinal cord still send pain signalsto the parts of the brain that processsensory information from the amputated limb
7154,Similar neurons have also been found in the sensory association cortex in the parietal lobe
7155,Some scientists have suggested that mirror neurons might be the basisof empathy
7156,Does the brain process complex behavior differently than simple behavior The frontal lobe is not the only source of complex goaloriented movement
7157,As discussed above the frontal lobe is a recent evolutionary achievement and is most fullydeveloped in humans
7158,Prey had to be hunted hygienemaintained food eaten and social behaviors performed
7159,In most animals these behavBRAIN AND BEHAVIOR Handy Psychology     PM  Page iors were patterned into fairly fixed packets of behaviors that would be released rather automatically in the face of the appropriate stimulus
7160,The part of the brain associated with these preset behavioralpackets is known as the basal ganglia
7161,This is an evolutionarily ancient brain region that precedes the evolution of the cortex and is found in mammals birds andeven reptiles
7162,These are packets ofmovements that serve a purposeriding a bike throwing a ball etc
7163,The unlearned motor programs are also known as fixed action patterns
7164,Inhumans the basal ganglia is heavily involved with learned motor programs
7165,Althoughcomplex behaviors are learned via the frontal lobe with practice the behavior becomesmore automatic and the basal ganglia comes into play
7166,Fixed action patterns are analogous to animal instincts and aremediated by the basal ganglia
7167,Thereis very little goal correction the behavior is a set response to a set stimulus
7168,They rarely check the results of their efforts to see if they have met their goal theysimply respond in a preprogrammed way to a set stimulus in this case the smell oftheir urine or feces
7169,Grooming behavior in multiple animals provides additional examples of fixed action patterns
7170,Additional examples include gnawing behavior in pigsand horses whinnying and shaking their heads
7171,For the most part thoughtful intentional behavior replaces automaticstimulusresponse chains
7172,In adulthood fixed action patterns can reemerge if there isdamage to the frontal lobe
7173,Certain psy chiatric conditions may also reflect pathological activation of fixed action patterns
7174,Forexample obsessive compulsive disorder OCD has been linked to basal gangliafrontallobe circuits
7175,It is characterized by repetitive stereotyped and senseless behaviorssuch as compulsive handwashing tapping straightening or organizing behavior
7176,If you can imagine the outcome of anaction you can evaluate whether or not it is worthwhile to take such an action
7177,With cognition human beings are able to thinkbefore they act and to correct their mistakes
7178,They are also able to plan future actionsand to anticipate possible outcomes
7179,These include planning analyzing considering alternative actions abstractionchanging sets etc
7180,These critical mental functions help people adapt to a complex andeverchanging environment
7181,They become more impulsive disorganized unable to plan and unable tomonitor and regulate their own behavior
7182,Specifically this involves the linking of representationsof events with memories or expectations of punishment
7183,The person can consider thenegative consequences of an intended action and inhibit or alter the action accordingly
7184,People with poor impulse control often do poorly on neuropsychological tests that measure executive functions like abstraction set switching and planning
7185,An iron rod crashed through his head tearing a large hole through his brain
7186,Surprisingly he survived this incident and in fact wasrelatively unharmed physically
7187,While he had once been a sober and wellbehavedcitizen after the accident he became rude impulsive and socially inappropriate
7188,We nowunderstand that he suffered from orbital frontal damage with severe damage to the areasof the brain centrally involved with impulse control and social judgment
7189,They are a veryquick and efficient way to respond to different circumstances in the environment
7190,Such circumstances might include aversive conditions such as danger or aggressionor rewarding conditions such as food sex safety or social bonds
7191,These include autonomic nervous system arousal facial expression muscular tension and subjective experience
7192,This packet of responses is almost like a computer macro that serves as preparation for a specificsituation
7193,In thisway their body is prepared not only for action but for aggressive action in particular
7194,For example in a situation ofdanger the emotional response of fear alerts the individual to the danger of the situation prepares the individual for physical flight and communicates to other people viafacial expression vocalization and physical posture that the individual senses danger
7195,These are biologically encoded unlearned human responses that areimmediately recognizable regardless of linguistic or cultural differences
7196,Many of Handy Psychology     PM  Page these emotions such as fear and anger are also found in other mammals
7197,Selfconsciousemotionssuch as shame embarrassment pride or guiltare also part of thehuman emotional repertoire
7198,These more complex emotions depend upon a certaindegree of cognitive development and relate to ones place in the social group
7199,Infants are born with emotional responsesthey are literally born crying
7200,Incontrast the ability to recognize and verbally label emotion Oh Im feeling sad
7201,issomething that develops with age and is to some extent dependent on appropriatesocial feedback
7202,Relatedly the basis of psychodynamic psychotherapy is the idea thatemotional maladjustment comes from lack of knowledge of ones own emotions
7203,But we do know that the group of brain structurescalled the limbic system is centrally involved with emotion
7204,The limbic system refers to a group of subcortical brain structures that wrap around the thalamus
7205,Although thereis disagreement about the exact boundaries of the limbic system the term is usuallyunderstood to include core brain structures involved in the processing of emotion
7206,It is an early responder to emotionally salient stimuli particularly fearful stimuli
7207,The amygdala has rich connections with other limbic areas as well aslower brain regions such as the midbrain and the brain stem
7208,For example the raphe nucleus generates serotonin the ventral tegmental area dopamine and the locus ceruleus norepinephrine
7209,Most psychiatric drugs target oneor more of these neurotransmitter systems
7210,The amygdala also connects to the frontal BRAIN AND BEHAVIORHandy Psychology     PM  Page and temporal lobes
7211,In this way the amygdala acts as a way station between the think ing and perceiving areas of the brain and the physiological control centers
7212,The HPA axis includes the hypothalamus pituitary gland and adrenal glands
7213,This triad is centrally involved in the stress response of the body
7214,The pituitary gland is a small structure below the hypothalamus and the adrenalglands lie just above the kidneys
7215,Cortisolinfluences many psychological responses including stress mood and some forms ofmental illness
7216,This important structure is involved with motivational drives such as hunger sex andthirst and also serves as a coordinator for the physiological centers of the brain
7217,Thehypothalamus is the master control center for the autonomic nervous system
7218,Our heart beats faster we start to sweat our stomach churns and our breathgrows rapid and shallow
7219,The hypothalamus activates the autonomic nervous system in two major ways
7220,The first is the more traditional route of synaptic connections between neurons
7221,Thesecond is through the release of hormones freefloating chemical messengers thatlargely travel through the blood stream
7222,Have I encountered this personsituationobject before Is this friend orfoe Although the hippocampus is not directly involved in emotion it is located nearthe other limbic structures and has neuronal connections with several of themincluding the amygdala the hypothalamus and the cingulate gyrus
7223,Handy Psychology     PM  Page Many mammal species are very social
7224,These elephants for instance are engaging in affectionate social behavior
7225,Our emotions evolved in large part to help us negotiate the social world  iStock
7226,It helps process sensory information from inside our bodies for example butterflies in our stomach orcramps in our intestines
7227,More specifically it has been associated with the processing ofaversive food tastes and the related experience of disgust
7228,The insula is located on theinside of the cortex surrounded by the temporal frontal and parietal lobes
7229,This is because sensory information about the physical state of the body plays acritical part in the subjective awareness of emotion
7230,Do you recall the sensation ofchanges in muscle tension energy level heartbeat etc Can you imagine experiencingintense emotions without feeling these bodily changes In sum the amygdala andhypothalamus primarily provide emotional outputthey activate the emotionalresponses
7231,Mammals are for the mostpart very social animals and emotions help in the core aspects of social functioning
7232,BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR Handy Psychology     PM  Page For example emotions cement social bonds in the interest of both mating and par enting
7233,Affection aggression fear contentment and excitement are all impossible to miss
7234,Animal emotions are simpler more directly tied to actions and to the here and now
7235,Dogsmay growl at a stranger rub against a beloved and trusted owner or wag their tails at asign that they are about to be taken for a walk
7236,In contrast human emotion is much lesstied to the present
7237,And our emotionalresponses are not restricted to our immediate environment
7238,Has the limbic system changed much across evolution The limbic system the seat of emotions has not changed as much as the frontal lobeacross evolution
7239,Our cortex is quite different from that of our mammalian cousinsour limbic system is not
7240,Even though our intellectual brains are vastly different our emotional brains are relatively similar
7241,The frontal lobe is richly connected to brain regions throughoutthe limbic system and many frontal lobe neurons that connect to limbic regions haveHandy Psychology     PM  Page Are Freuds ego and id concepts rooted in biological fact Much of psychoanalytic theory has required modification since Sigmund Freuds original work
7242,Nonetheless Freuds concepts of the ego and the id have held up remarkably well over these past  years
7243,It helps us adapt our wishes and urges to cold reality
7244,The id onthe other hand is the seat of our most primitive and animalistic desires
7245,The id can be equated with the limbic system the seat of our emotions
7246,Just as the ego serves to control the id the frontal lobe serves to control the limbic system
7247,Emotions are blunt instrumentsthey are very fast but not veryprecise
7248,The frontal lobe helps us refine our emotional responses to ensure that ourresponses are proportional to the situation
7249,This is done with the use of thought byinterjecting thought between emotion and response
7250,Sometimes cognitive analysis of the situation may increase the emotional response
7251,On the other hand cognitive analysis frequently serves to dampen the emotional response by helping the individual consider the consequences of acting on emotions
7252,If I quit my job I wont be able to pay my rent
7253,This brain region is particularly important for impulse control for the inhibition of dangerousor reckless actions
7254,The case of Phineas Gage is a famous example of orbital frontal damage
7255,Orbital frontal inhibition probably works through linkingrepresentations of future events with representations of past or future punishment
7256,Although this researchis still fairly new it may be quite radical in that it provides the first evidence of theneurobiological substrates of certain aspects of personality
7257,Does an immature frontal lobe mean poor emotional regulation  As the frontal lobe is the last to develop across childhood and in fact is not fully developed until adulthood emotional control also does not fully mature until adulthood
7258,This is intuitively obvious if we think of the relative emotional immaturity of childrenand even adolescents
7259,The Babinski reflex and frontal release signs are examples of this
7260,Consequently the person loses social judgment impulse controland the ability to plan and to analyze situations effectively
7261,Examples of these behaviors include rooting turning the face toward an object if it touches the cheek near themouth and puckering of the lips in response to touch of the skin above the upper lip
7262,The palmar grasp reflex helps an infant hold onto its mother
7263,In this reaction the infant grasps at anything that strokes its palm
7264,With development of the frontal lobe these crude automatic behaviors aresuppressed
7265,The presence of frontal release signs in adulthoodtherefore is a sign of significant brain damage
7266,It is through neurotransmitters that one neuron tells another neuron to fire
7267,If we think of the neuronal networks of the brain as a vast economy neurotransmitters can be seen as the currencyof that economy
7268,Excitatory neurotransmitters increase the likelihood of firing while inhibitory neurotransmitters decrease it
7269,Allthree are classified as monoamines based on their chemical structure
7270,Glutamate is a general excitatory neurotransmitterit increases the likelihood that neurons willfire
7271,GABA is a general inhibitory neurotransmitterit decreases the likelihood of neurons firing
7272,Histamine is known for its involvement in the allergic response
7273,Acetylcholine is involved with memory and is targeted by antiAlzheimers drugs
7274,Cognitive enhancers are a fairlynew class of drugs developed to treatAlzheimers dementia
7275,Dopamine is a neuro  transmitter frequently targeted by psychiatric medicationsiStock
7276,The nigrostriatal tracts originate in the substantia nigra in the midbrain and project to the basal ganglia
7277,These tracts are involved with motor control control of physical movements and are the neurons damaged in Parkinsons disease
7278,Antipsychotic drugs can also cause problems with this system resulting in abnormal movements
7279,The second major dopaminergic tract is known as the mesolimbic pathway
7280,It originates in the ventral tegmental area also in the midbrain and projects to thenucleus accumbens and some areas of the limbic system
7281,The cell bodies of these neurons are located deep in the midbrain or brain stem but their axons travel great distances across the limbic system and thecortex branching off to form synapses with many other neurons along the way
7282,line in New YorkCity runs through City College Columbia University the theater district and thefinancial district each neurotransmitter tract runs through specific areas of thebrain that serve specific functions
7283,line running downBroadway you would have reduced activity in the four districts mentioned above
7284,Likewise if you blockade dopamine activity in the nigrastriatal tract you willhave reduced activity in the basal ganglia and subsequent problems with motorcoordination will arise
7285,BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR the mesolimbic tract this originates in the ventral tegmental area
7286,It projects to thecortex with particularly rich connections in the frontal lobe
7287,This pathway is associated with psychotic symptoms and is targeted by many antipsychotic medications
7288,This is anallpurpose motivation machine that is active in drug craving cocaine methamphetamine alcohol and cigarettes and in gambling eating and sex
7289,It may be active aswell in many other activities that elicit strong motivation and desire
7290,In humans not surprisingly it is involved with a verywide array of functions ranging from the simplest to the most advanced
7291,For exampleserotonin is involved with hunger sleep migraine headaches and sexual function
7292,Itis also involved with mood anxiety and anticipation of harm
7293,People with low levels ofserotonin demonstrate impulse control problems while people with high levels ofserotonin manifest excessive levels of caution and inhibition
7294,The serotonin tractsoriginate in the raphe nuclei in the brainstem and project widely throughout the cerebral cortex
7295,Certain serotonergic tracts also project downwards to the spinal cord
7296,Handy Psychology     PM  Page Serotonin is targeted by the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors SSRIs the widely used class of antidepressants
7297,Examples of SSRIs include fluoxetine Prozac sertraline Zoloft and paroxetine Paxil
7298,SSRIs are also effective in the treatment ofanxiety disorders and obsessive compulsive disorder
7299,Norepinephrine also activates the autonomic nervous system during the fightflight response affecting activity in the cardiovascular muscular and digestive systems
7300,In fact beta blockers a class of medicationused to treat high blood pressure act on the noradrenergic system the tract of neurons that release norepinephrine
7301,In addition the noradrenergic system is targeted bya class of antidepressant medication known as tricyclics
7302,This suggests that norepinephrine may also be involved in mood
7303,Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain it activates the nervous system and appears to be involved in learning and memory
7304,In contrast GABA is aninhibitory neurotransmitter it calms the nervous system
7305,GABA neurotransmittersare targeted by the benzodiazepines antianxiety medications that also act as tranquilizers
7306,Examples of benzodiazepines include clonazepam Klonopin lorazepam Ativan diazepam Valium and alprazolam Xanax
7307,Because of their enjoyably relaxingeffect as well as their addictive potential these GABAergic medications are sometimes used as drugs of abuse
7308,These alternative forms of brain chemicals are also known as neuromodulators because they modulate the action of neurotransmitters
7309,The montane voles live in fairly isolated mountain burrows while theprairie voles live in densely populated colonies
7310,Consequently the two types of voles demonstrate very differentsocial behaviors
7311,The prairie volebut not the montane vole displaysmonogamous mating patterns and agenerally high level of social behavior
7312,Vasopressin has been directly linked to socialbehaviors displayed by the male prairie vole but not his montane cousin
7313,Specifically male prairie voles display both partner preference and mate guarding
7314,As glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter inhibiting glutamate serves to reduce brain activity in effect tocalm down the brain
7315,Opiates are extracted from the sap of the opium poppy
7316,Thus the brainresponds to opiates the same way that it responds to our own endogenous internallyBRAIN AND BEHAVIOR Handy Psychology     PM  Page created opioids
7317,Several very potent painkillers such as morphine heroin and opium are made from opiates
7318,Because of the relaxing and euphoric effects of opiates opiatebased medications are popular drugs of abuse
7319,Oxytocin has been linked to childbearing and lactation and both oxytocinand vasopressin have been linked to parenting behavior as well as to sexual orgasmand the emotional connection formed during sexual activity
7320,A famous series of studies on the social behavior of the vole see Sidebar suggests that these chemicals areless related to sexual behavior per se than to the formation of emotional bonds
7321,Typically the medications do not contain the actual neurotransmitters butinstead contain various chemicals that regulate the action of neurotransmitters
7322,This keepsthe serotonin molecules in the synapse longer giving them more time to bind toreceptor sites and therefore stimulate the firing of the postsynaptic neuron
7323,To visualize this process imagine someone standing at your door continuously pressing hisor her finger on your doorbell
7324,In fact a number of psychiatric medications are sometimes misused as drugs of abuse
7325,Drugs ofabuse tend to cause quicker and more intense pleasurable effects than other drugs
7326,Itis this high that makes these drugs attractive as recreational drugs
7327,For example inresponse to foreign chemicals that mimic the activity of neurotransmitters the neurons may decrease their own neurotransmitter production or activity
7328,This change of the actual structure of the neurons contributes to theaddictive process
7329,Drug tolerance the need for more and more of the same Handy Psychology     PM  Page drug to achieve the same psychological effect is likewise related to the changes in the structure of the neuron
7330,While this is most true in childhood the brain continues to be modifiedby experience throughout adulthood
7331,Although genetics are crucially important in prenatal brain development much of postnatal brain development is dependent on learning
7332,Infact every time the brain fires it is slightly altered
7333,One way that memory takes place isthrough a process known as longterm potentiation
7334,The neurons fire in a particular pat tern and the connections between the neurons involved are strengthened
7335,New dendrites can branch out as can new axon terminals to form new synapseswith nearby neurons
7336,One way to resolve this naturenurture dilemma is to assume that genetics sets the outerboundaries of brain development
7337,Even if you bring a child up among horses the child will not develop the brain BRAIN AND BEHAVIORHandy Psychology     PM  Page of a horse
7338,Because of the central role of experience on brain development thenature of environmental input in childhood is critical
7339,Nutrition education verbalexposure language emotional and interpersonal experienceall critically impact theformation of connections between neurons the building of neural networks
7340,In this way early environment becomes hardwired into the childs brain
7341,With timethese early environmental influences become increasingly difficult and sometimeseven impossible to change
7342,Although there isa peak period of synaptogenesis creation of new synapses in the first two years of lifesynaptogenesis continues rapidly throughout a childs first decade
7343,Handy Psychology     PM  Page BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR in brain growth also takes fuel
7344,Therefore if there is inadequate nutrition brain growth in childhood will be hampered
7345,Although it seems to make intuitive sense that the quality of food will also affect brain development during childhood the research is lessrobust on the effect of specific diets on learning
7346,Children are born with the capacity to recognize sounds made in any language
7347,Inthis way children become hardwired to speak and understand their native language
7348,Moreover as children grow older itbecomes more difficult to learn new languages
7349,Since the time of Freud psychotherapists have been aware of the severe and persistent psychological damagecaused by traumatic experiences but neuroscience is now catching up with the clinicians
7350,Trauma triggers the bodys stress response mediated through the HPA axis
7351,Overactivation of the HPA axis as can occur with chronic trauma such as child abusedulls its flexibility sort of like a rubber band that has been stretched out of shape
7352,By altering the way he touched the tail of the seaslug Kandel trained the animal to either amplify or minimize a protective reflex
7353,Handy Psychology     PM  Page This results in people with either overactive or underactive stress responses
7354,Another set of studies hassuggested that there is a reduced volume in the hippocampus in people with trauma histories
7355,This may relate to the distortions of memory that often accompanies trauma
7356,Several different branches of psychologyincluding psychoanalysis attachment theory and even cognitive therapyexplain personalitydevelopment in terms of the profound impact of early interpersonal experience
7357,For one there is suggestion that representations of early childhoodrelationships are processed in the superior medial prefrontal cortex
7358,Once these representations have been encoded it is hard to change them
7359,It has also been suggestedthat the emotional tone of early childhood experiences is preserved in the underlyingneural circuitry
7360,More specifically neural circuits underlying positive emotions arestrengthened or weakened depending on the degree of positive emotion experiencedin childhood
7361,Further the circuits related to the stress response particularly the HPAaxis are strongly influenced by the degree of stress experienced during childhood
7362,Over time this affects the flexibility and resilience of the bodys stress response
7363,Their stress reactions are easilytriggered and they can only calm down with difficulty
7364,In some cases this might bethe result of abnormal levels of stress during childhood
7365,The beginnings of Shame  Doubt emotional objectconstancy Age  Oedipal Initiative vs
7366,For example Sigmund Freud developed a theory of the psychosexual stages ofchildhood Erik Erikson translated Freuds psychosexual stages into a theory of emotional and social development and Jean Piaget wrote about intellectual development
7367,Daniel Levinson and Roger Gould have also writtenabout adult development
7368,Freud proposed five psychosexual stages oral anal phallic latencyand genital
7369,Freuds general theory of psychology often referred to as his metapsychol ogy is difficult to understand in modern terms
7370,He wrote in the late nineteenth andearly twentieth century and framed his concepts in the physical science of the day
7371,Itwas very important to him that his work was seen as having scientific merit
7372,Each stage of Freuds theory refers to a partof the body known as an erogenous zone
7373,For example the anal stage is associated with either a rigid need for order or a messy lack of selfdiscipline
7374,Later theoristsinterpreted his psychosexual stages less literally seeing his ideas in more metaphorical terms
7375,During this time thechilds primary erogenous zone is in the mouth
7376,The personality traits associated withthis stage include dependency and a kind of oceanic and allencompassing emotionalexperience
7377,For one thing Handy Psychology     PM  Page nursing is a central part of their life
7378,Moreover as any parent can tell you babies love to put things in their mouth
7379,As they are incapable of surviving on their own they have intense and continuousneed of parental attention
7380,Atthis point the childs erogenous zone transfers from the mouth to the anus
7381,The quality of parental discipline during this process can influence the childsdevelopment through this stage
7382,If the parent is too strict the child might becomeanal retentive focused too much on controlling and holding in feces
7383,In personalityterms this translates to an overemphasis on control selfdiscipline neatness andstinginess with regard to money
7384,If the parents are insufficiently strict around toilettraining the child can become analexplosive inadequately focused on controllingfeces
7385,The associated personality traits include messiness and a lack of selfdiscipline
7386,Infants tendency to put any object they can find into their mouths is highlighte d in Freuds notion of the oral stage  iStock
7387,Handy Psychology     PM  Page a conflict between instinctual urges and societal restraints
7388,In this phase the erogenous stage moves from the anus to the phallus or the penis
7389,The fact that half the populationdoes not have a phallus evidently did not deter Freud from naming this phase after anexclusively male body part
7390,If parents react to this stage with excessive punitiveness the child willbe overcome with guilt and suppress his or her own initiative and ambition
7391,The Oedipal complex is bestunderstood in boys though Freud also proposed an Electra complex for girls
7392,Both complexes are named after characters in classical Greek plays
7393,In little boys the phallicstage brings an increased interest in theirown genitals
7394,Along with this they startto become interested in their mothers asromantic partners
7395,Recognizing theirfathers as rivals for their mothers exclusive attention they fantasize about getting rid of their fathers even of killingthem
7396,They project their guilt feelingsonto their fathers and fear that theirmuch larger and more powerful fatherswill retaliate against them by cutting offtheir now highly valued penis
7397,This newfound respect for authorityreflects the development of the superego  Freud based many of his ideas on themes from ancient Greek literature
7398,Handy Psychology     PM  Page the part of the mind that adopts parental rules as the basis of a moral code
7399,Freud attributed many aspects of adult personality to the successful resolution of the Oedipalcomplex
7400,In Freuds view the little girl realizes that hermother does not have a penis
7401,She is tormented with penis envy herself and blames her mother for her own lack of a penis
7402,She resolves this dilemmaby identifying with her mothers childbearing abilities
7403,She realizes that she will growup to have a baby just like her mother and accepts that as consolation for her lack of apenis
7404,Freud infamously concluded that because girls cannot be influenced by castration anxiety they were likely to have weaker superegos than boys
7405,The sexual or libidinal impulses gounderground at this stage they lie latent
7406,Instead libidinal energy is translated into nonsexual pursuits such as school peer relationships games etc
7407,Of note in this stage Freud does not restrict hisfocus to male genitals only
7408,Oral and anal pleasureremain but they are subordinate to genital pleasure
7409,Successful entrance into thisstage allows the person to attain pleasure through sexual intercourse
7410,The personalitytraits that have been associated with genital sexuality include the capacity for maturereciprocal and intimate relationshipsthe capacity for give and take
7411,In general Freudessentially equated particular personality traits with specific body parts
7412,Even though Freuds erogenous zones do play important roles in childhood the mouth in infancy PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPANHandy Psychology     PM  Page toilet training during the toddler years and genitals in adolescence the psychologi cal tasks of child development cannot be reduced to parts of the body
7413,In effect he interpreted Freuds emphasis on sexual body parts as a metaphorfor emotional and interpersonal processes
7414,The first four stages take place in childhood while the last three stages cover adulthood
7415,Mistrust stage The first four stages cover childhood and parallel Freuds psychosexual stages
7416,Mistrust parallels Freuds oral stage and takes place during the first year and a half of life
7417,If the child is well cared for and his or her needs are met the childwill experience the world as a generally safe and positive place
7418,If the child does notreceive this basic level of care it sets the stage for a general experience of mistrustthe world will be seen as cold and dangerous
7419,This fundamental world view forms thefoundation of all later psychological development
7420,Shame and Doubt parallels Freuds anal stage and takesplace from about age  months to about age three
7421,During this period there is newdemand for selfcontrol and for control of bodily functions
7422,The process of toilet training is an important example of this
7423,With these new demands for the first time thechild is exposed to the possibility of shame
7424,Depending on the parentsresponses to the childs behavior the child either develops a rudimentary sense ofautonomy or becomes excessively constrained by shame and doubt
7425,Guilt parallels Freuds phallic stage and takes the Oedipal complex into account
7426,This stage takes place during the preschool years from aboutage three to age six
7427,At this stage the child has developed the capacity for initiative toset goals and intentionally pursue them
7428,The childs sense of right and wrong depends on a simplistic and blackandwhiteunderstanding of parental rules and prohibitions
7429,Depending on parental reactions tothis stage the child will develop confidence in his or her own initiative or becomeoverwhelmed and stifled by guilt
7430,Inferiority This stage parallels Freuds latency stage and takes place during middle childhood fromabout age six to about age twelve
7431,As Freud noted children of this age are less emotionally tumultuous
7432,If they cannot master the tasks expected of them at this stage they feel inferior and incapable
7433,One of Eriksons particular interests was the concept of ego identity
7434,In late adolescence people are expected to leave the shelterof their family and start to take their place within the larger society to take on anadult role in society
7435,Part of this process involves the development of an identity
7436,Isolation Another of the challenges of early adulthood involves the capacity for romantic intimacy
7437,Erikson believed that it was necessary to consolidate a personal identity beforecommitting to a life partnership
7438,We need to have a sufficiently solid sense of selfbefore we can endanger it by merging our lives with another person
7439,If the young PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPANHandy Psychology     PM  Page adult cannot manage the task of intimacy the cost is isolation
7440,While Erikson mainly focused on heterosexual love and marriage he also included the capacity to commit toa social group in his notion of intimacy
7441,Thus while Eriksons theories are stillwell regarded they must be considered within the context of the culture
7442,By this point people have generally established asolid sense of self a clear role in society and a stable romantic partnership
7443,Up untilthis point people focus on themselves and on establishing their own adult lives
7444,This new need for generativity can be met through parenting through mentorship of younger people in the workplace orthrough other forms of contributing to ones community
7445,The opposite of generativityis stagnation a feeling of being stuck in a rut
7446,At this point the adult is facing the end of life
7447,In otherwords the adult is facing the reality of his or her own death
7448,Life is not infinite it hasan end and the end is getting closer
7449,If they cannot accept the reality of their life if they are plagued by a senseof unfinished business or of disappointment they can only face death with despair
7450,In  she published a book with Anni Bergman andFred Pine called the Psychological Birth of the Human Infant
7451,This book was very influential in psychoanalytic circles because of its use of the direct observation of children
7452,In other words Mahler applied the scientific method to clinical theory something few psychoanalytic theorists had bothered to do previously
7453,Mahler was most interested in the childs growing ability to recognize both the self and the mother as independent andseparate beings
7454,It is the childs developing capacity to represent or conceptualize the mother that allows independence from the mother
7455,In otherwords ideas of child development were based on observations of adult patients
7456,Handy Psychology     PM  Page reconstructed the childhoods of their patients
7457,The most severe psychopathology was assumed to reflect regression to the earliest stage of childhood
7458,Less severe psy chopathology was assumed to reflect regression to later stages in childhood like theOedipal complex
7459,AlthoughMahler grounded her ideas in accepted psychoanalytic theory she added the actualobservation of real children
7460,It is perhaps no surprise then that the parts of her theory that are based on real observation have had the most staying power while the partsderived from purely theoretical assumptions have been much less influential
7461,There were areas with chairs for the mothers to sit comfortably
7462,This gave the babies the choice either to be close totheir mothers or to separate from them in order to explore the rooms full of toys
7463,Mahler assumed that the separationindividuation process did notstart until this age
7464,The next three stages are termed subphases of the separationindividuation phase proper
7465,Differentiation starts at four to five months and continues until about ten months
7466,Practicing ranges from about ten months until sixteen to eighteen months
7467,Rapprochement ranges from about eigh teen months to about two years
7468,Her ideas about these two stages are heavily indebted to assumptions about infancy drawn from work with emotionally disturbed children and adults
7469,Thefirst phase is called the normal autistic phase and takes place from birth to two months
7470,At this period the child is thought to be uninterested in the outer world thechild is withdrawn only attending to inner bodily experiences
7471,In the symbiotic phasethe babys attention has moved out beyond the sensations of his or her own body toinclude a newfound interest in the mother
7472,They do not differentiate their mother from themselves and so live with an illusion of blissful fusion
7473,In the normal autistic phase children live as if inside their ownegg
7474,The eggshell is a barrier between the baby and the outside world
7475,In the symbioticphase the egg extends to include the mother as well as the baby
7476,The childs entireworld includes only the mother and the self
7477,It is as if the child is hatching out of the shell finally entering the world psychologically as well as physically
7478,It startsaround four to five months and extends to about ten months
7479,This is also the first ofMahlers stages that was fully based on direct observation of infants
7480,This isalso the beginning of physically moving away from the mother the baby slides out of themothers lap or crawls away from her
7481,A number of behaviors demonstrate the childs growing awareness of the mothersidentity as a separate person
7482,The glasses for example come offwhile the lips do not
7483,The child can also compare the features of the mothers face tothat of the stranger
7484,By aboutten months children are frequentlypulling themselves up by grabbing ontofurniture and at least temporarily theyare able to stand on their own
7485,This dramatic motor developmenthastens the physical aspect of the separa tionindividuation phase
7486,More and more babies can now get about on their own
7487,The child appears to be simplydelighted with the newfound power andfreedom
7488,Separation anxiety decreases asdoes sensitivity to minor knocks and falls
7489,Frequently we can see children of thisage running gleefully away from their parents as if on top of the world
7490,Often they are running toward the street with a horrified parent close behind
7491,To children of this age the world is their oyster
7492,AlthoughMahler locates this period prior to age two parents might recognize this period as theTerrible Twos
7493,In Mahlers view the child has recovered from the elation of the practicing period to recognize the terrible dilemma of independence
7494,Just as they can separate from their mothers their mothers can separate from them
7495,It is as if children realize that they are only three feet highverysmall people in a very large world
7496,The child is caught in a conflict between the fierce desire for greater indepen dence and the inevitable distress of recognizing the limits of ones control over the  A toddler often experiences sheer joy over mastering the ability to walk  iStock
7497,This same conflict is encountered again in adolescence and the resultingbehaviors are fairly similar
7498,A child willbe very clingy toward the mother andthen suddenly push her away
7499,This is alsothe time of temper tantrums and of insistent selfassertion
7500,The child discoversthe word No Certainly we have allheard toddlers of this age shouting NoNo No to any request or demand
7501,Children can feel both anger and love toward their mother without fearing the loss oftheir relationship
7502,This integration of positive and negative features supports the childs internalization of the mother an achievement that gives children much greater control over their emotions and their behavior
7503,As the positive memoryof the mother can now withstand the storm of the childs negative feelings the child isless afraid of the loss of the relationship
7504,The child is at the beginnings of emotional object constancy as the capacity to keep both positive and negative feelings towardsomeone in mind is a skill that is far from mature at two years of age
7505,In fact this hallmark of psychological maturity remains a challenge throughout the lifespan
7506,Unlike Freud PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPAN Temper tantrums are a hallmark of the toddler years
7507,Although infants can certainly get very upset they do notthrow temper tantrums per se
7508,While frustrating for theparent the onset of temper tantrums is actually a sign ofcognitive development
7509,The child has become aware that heor she has a will and that this will is being thwarted  iStock
7510,He wanted to understand the ways that chil dren learn to understand their environment
7511,It was Piagets brilliant insight to recognize that children do not only differ from adults in the content of their knowl edge they also differ in the structure of their knowledge
7512,Piaget proposed four stages of intellectual or cognitive development sensory motor preoperational concrete operational and formal operational
7513,Although Piagetfailed to consider the important roles of culture language or environment on cognitive development his basic ideas maintain their tremendous importance and influence particularly in the field of educational psychology
7514,It is roughly parallel withFreuds oral stage and Eriksons trust vs
7515,In this stage the child onlyknows the world through direct physical contact
7516,In other words the child only knowsthe world through sensory experience e
7517,The childs attention will simply drift to thenext interesting event
7518,If you hide the rattle behind apillow the child will move the pillow to look for the rattle
7519,Not only can children think about things that are notimmediately present but they can also communicate about them to other people
7520,Thesemiotic function shepherds the child out of the sensorymotor stage and into the preoperational stage
7521,The child can represent the event mentally andis no longer dependent on immediate physical contact for knowledge of the world
7522,This is an enormous step forward and frees the childs intelligence from the constraints of time and space
7523,Nonetheless the childs comprehension of space and timeis still very immature
7524,As we can imagine the way a threeyearold understands therules of nature is very different from that of an adult
7525,They cannot understand that an object can change shape and then change back again
7526,Examples of this ability include the conservation of volume and conservation of substance
7527,This means they cannot pay attention to more than one feature of the object ata time
7528,They can pay attention to height or to width but not to height and width at thesame time
7529,In one experiment he poured a specificamount of liquid into a tall beaker
7530,Then he poured the same amount of liquid into ashort and fat beaker
7531,Children in thepreoperational stage would insist that the tall and thin beaker had more liquidalthough an older child could understand that both beakers have the same amount ofliquid
7532,In another experiment the child is presented with two round balls of clay ofthe same size
7533,In front of the childs eyes one ball of clay is rolled into a long thin PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPANHandy Psychology     PM  Page shape
7534,These children could not conserve thevolume or mass of the object as it wastransformed
7535,Piaget performed similarexperiments to study conservation ofnumber quantity and weight
7536,It is concurrent with Freudslatency age and Eriksons industry vs
7537,By this stage childrenhave mastered the basic rules of the physical world
7538,This stage is marked bythe conservation of volume substance number and other physical features
7539,In other words the child no longer gets hooked on onlyone feature of a situation
7540,This does not mean that children are now ready to leave their parents and live independently but that they areready to learn the basic skills necessary to function in their society
7541,In the contemporary Western world this means learning academic skills in school
7542,Thus it is no coincidence that Erikson referred to this period as the stage ofIndustry vs
7543,Now that the child has grasped the basic rules of physical reality he or she must learn the rudimentary rules of work
7544,At age seven Max is old enough to recognize that the tall thin glass holds the same amount of milk as the short wide bowlin this case one liquid cup
7545,This understanding of conservation of volume is a hallmark of Piagets concrete operational stage photo courtesy Roger Jnecke
7546,This is the beginning of adolescence a time of tremendous change in all areas of development
7547,As Piagetpoints out among the many changes associated with adolescence there are significant cognitive changes as well
7548,In this way concrete operational children are more restricted to the present orto the concrete
7549,Adolescents can thenplan ways to test each of those hypotheses
7550,This kind of reasoning from the hypothetical is known as hypotheticodeductive reasoning and is the same kind of reasoning used in scientific experiments
7551,In contrast children in the concrete operationalstage are more likely to problem solve through trial and error
7552,The intellectual skills that Piaget studied are mediated by the prefrontalcortex the area of the brain involved with complex cognitive processes
7553,The frontallobe is the last area of the brain to develop in childhood and much of its developmenttakes place within the first decade of life
7554,In fact there is a peak period of synaptogenesis creation of synapses the connections between brain cells in the first two years oflifeduring Piagets sensorymotor stage
7555,Synaptogenesis continues at a rapid pacethroughout the first decade of life bringing us up to the doorstep of the formal operational stage
7556,Adolescents can PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPANHandy Psychology     PM  Page plan consider possible outcomes of their actions consider alternative solutions to prob lems and otherwise negotiate their way in the world far more effectively than youngerchildren can
7557,They can also understand abstract concepts like religious or political beliefsystems in ways that younger children simply cannot appreciate
7558,It is no coincidence thatpeople first become aware of and interested in political movements in adolescence
7559,Whilechildren may parrot their parents political beliefs they cannot truly reason out their ownbeliefs until they attain some degree of formal operational thought
7560,Piaget based his studies on adolescents in prestigious schools that specifically taught the skills of the scientificmethod
7561,Thus it is not surprising that adolescents and adults without the same educational advantages would not perform as well in the tests of basic physics that Piagetused to measure formal operational thought
7562,Thus the concept of formal operations appears to be valid but the tests that measure it need to have ecological validity that is they need to be appropriate to the situation at hand
7563,Influenced byPiaget he developed a large body of research investigating moral reasoning
7564,In fact Piaget himself had studied the moral development of childrenbut in a fairly limited way
7565,He wrote up scenarios that involved a moraldilemma and presented them to his research subjects
7566,He was much more interested in the way that people reasoned about their moral choices than in their actual conclusions
7567,Like Piaget he was more interested inthe thought process than the content
7568,Each level contains two stages for a total of six stages altogeth er
7569,Kohlberg believed that all children go through the same sequence of stages in thesame order
7570,A fair amount of research supports this view for the first two levels ofmoral development
7571,He was less interested in the content of the answerswhether Heinz should or should not have stolen the drugthan in the nature of the reasoning peopleused to come to a moral decision
7572,In Europe a woman was near death from a special kind of cancer
7573,Therewas one drug that the doctors thought might save her
7574,It was a form ofradium that a druggist in the same town had recently discovered
7575,He paid  for the radium andcharged  for a small dose of the drug
7576,He told the druggist that his wife was dying and asked him to sell it cheaper or let him paylater
7577,But the druggist said No I discovered the drug and Im going tomake money from it
7578,So Heinz got desperate and broke in to the mansstore to steal the drug for his wife
7579,In both cases morality is determined by the consequences of the action to the person performing the behaviorwhether the individual is punishedor rewarded
7580,In stage  the child has learned that different people canhave different perspectivesthat is there can be more than one view of right andwrong
7581,Behavior may be wrong because the other person may retaliate or may fail tocooperate in the future
7582,This level covers stages  and  Good Interpersonal Relationships and Maintaining the Social Order
7583,In both stages morality of a behavior is determined by its effect on social relationships
7584,In stage  the person is concerned withthe emotional impact on an interpersonal relationship
7585,The focus is on issues of empathy care and relief of suffering
7586,In stage  the person recognizes the need for rulesthat all members of society must follow
7587,For example people should not steal becausesociety would become unmanageable if everybody stole
7588,In these stages the person is interested in abstract concepts of justice and a just society
7589,At stage  the person recognizes the necessity for social rulesand laws but also recognizes that laws themselves can be unjust
7590,Therefore there aretimes that a moral act may not be a legal act
7591,At stage  the person considers theimportance of abstract universal principles of justice and believes that laws should besubordinate to general moral principles
7592,For example the value of a human life shouldoutweigh the law protecting private property
7593,In his later research Kohlberg abandoned stage  saying that too few people actually reached this stage
7594,A certain level of abstract thinking is necessary for mature moralreasoning
7595,For example people in urban environ ments tend to score at stage  with an appreciation of the importance of impersonalrules that all people need to follow
7596,Gilligan believed that Kohlbergs theory was biased by anexclusively masculine viewpoint
7597,She noted that the bulk of his subjects were maleand that his emphasis on abstract thought and impersonal laws reflected his masculine bias
7598,Gilligan claimed that women are more likely to emphasize empathy interpersonal relationships and concern for the feelings of others and are therefore morelikely to score at level
7599,This does not mean that women are less moral than menonly that they reasoned from a different set of values
7600,While Gillligans critique raisesimportant points about Kohlbergs prioritizing intellect over emotion she also hasbeen criticized for oversimplifying the process of moral reasoning in women
7601,THE ROLE OF CULTURE Is childhood development the same for all cultures Grounded in our fundamental biology much of childhood is the same across cultures
7602,All children grow from infants to toddlers to children to adolescents
7603,All learn to walkand talk and play and eventually to take part in the work of their society
7604,All childrendevelop profound emotional attachments to their family and their primary caregivers
7605,Moreover all children have to develop an identity within their social group and to balance selfexpression with selfinhibition
7606,Somecultures value open expression of deeply felt emotion and others value emotional PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPANHandy Psychology     PM  Page restraint believing public displays of emotion to be vulgar
7607,Cultures also varywidely with regard to the emphasis ondependence vs
7608,Additionally different cultures have disparateviews on stability versus change and religious tradition versus scientific thought
7609,Cultures also differ with regard to theperceived value of intellectual development of physical prowess or athleticismand of sexual modesty
7610,Not only do different cultures varyfrom each other but there is considerablevariation within cultures
7611,Cultural influences are subtle in the infancy toddler and preschool years
7612,By middle childhoodcultural differences become more central as the child is educated in the specific waysof his or her culture
7613,By adolescence cultural differences are even more acute as adolescents prepare to take on an adult role within their own culture
7614,As the science of psychology developed in Western Europe and Americamany psychological theories have been limited by a kind of cultural myopia a shortsightedness
7615,Aspects of psychological development that were assumed to be universalturn out to be culturally specific
7616,Some cultures for instance frown on allowing too muchfree emotional expression especially in public
7617,Handy Psychology     PM  Page Are there cultural differences in patterns of attachment Attachment theory looks at the ways that children understand their emotional bonds with key caregivers
7618,Security of infantmother attachment has been assessed inseveral different cultures including Japanese German and American populations
7619,Cultural differences were only found in the quality of insecure attachments
7620,In other words no one country was any more likely to have unhealthy motherinfantpairs but the nature of insecurely attached motherinfant dyads differed across thethree countries
7621,In contrast German children were more likely tobe classified as anxiousavoidant than American children reflecting their tendency tominimize their distress at separation from their mother
7622,This brings to mind the Russian novelist Leo Tolstoys famous saying that all happy families resemble one anotherbut each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way
7623,As mentioned above our intelligence develops through solving problems that are directly relevant to us
7624,Tests that do not take ecological validity into account therefore are likely to be culturally biased
7625,During the first year the body almost triples in weight and becomes about onethirdlonger
7626,Moreover a newborn is unable to talk crawl move independently or evenhold his or her head up
7627,By the end of the first year the typical child can crawl manipulate objects and is beginning to walk and talk
7628,In fact much of human development PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPANHandy Psychology     PM  Page in the first year of life happens before birth in other species
7629,For example horses and deer are ready to walk immediately after birth
7630,For the most part these skillshave to do with their sensory abilities
7631,In the early s a psychologist named Robert Franz started a revolution in infancy research by building a device that could monitor infants viewingpatterns by noting the reflections on their pupils
7632,Infants also prefer to look at images of faces rather thanscrambled facial features
7633,Finally infants can only focus about eight to ten inchesfrom their face
7634,All these visual tendencies prepare infants to interact with their mother specifically to recognize and make sense of her face
7635,They prefer curved lines and human faces over random features  iStock
7636,Handy Psychology     PM  Page ence to female voices over male voices and highpitched voices over lowerpitched ones
7637,Baby talkor the use of highpitched simplified repetitive and highly melodicspeech patternsis found across different cultures and different languages
7638,By usingbaby talk adults and older children reflexively adapt their speech patterns to infantscapabilities
7639,Babies are also born with a developed sense of smell and the ability to discriminate sweet tastes from salty bitter or sour ones
7640,Babies recognize their mothers voice immediately after birth and within several days can recognize the smell of their mothers breast milk
7641,Within the first day of life infants canbe trained to suck longer on a nipple to hear a womans voice rather than a mansvoice
7642,Babies also look longer at novel images and turn away sooner from imagesthat they have already seen multiple times
7643,Eightdayold babies also respond differently to their mother if she wears a mask looking at her more frequently duringfeeding as if recognizing something is not right
7644,Thus infants are born with thecapacity to store sensory information in memory and to make distinctions that arecritical for their survival
7645,Most of these disappear within the first year of life
7646,It is likely that these reflect vestiges from our evolutionary past
7647,Reflex Description Babkin The mouth opens in response to pressure on the palms
7648,Rooting The baby turns toward the stimulus if the cheek is stroked
7649,Grasping The fingers curl around and grasp onto any object that touches the palm
7650,Stern concluded that to the infant theworld was less like a smooth movie than a series of largely unrelated snapshots
7651,Theinfant is first aware of the patterning of stimulation the musical arrangement ofsight sounds smells and touch
7652,With time these patterns of stimulation consolidateinto objects and the objects settle into predictable routines
7653,From this process children develop an understanding of themselves in the world and of their relationshipwith other people
7654,Babies learn to recognize facesand facial expressions to take turns in a kind of protoconversation and to read intention and meaning in the behavior of others
7655,By four to six months babies recognizediscrete facial expressions in their caregivers
7656,In other words before they explore a new toy or approach a stranger they look back at their mother to check herread on the situation
7657,If the mother looks calm and confident the baby will approach the new situation with interest
7658,By expressingemotion infants communicate essentialinformation about their comfort andwellbeing as well as their immediateneeds
7659,Although infants are born with anemotional system in place it is fairlycrude at birth
7660,These are global emotional stateswith none of the nuance of the emotionalrepertoire of an adult
7661,Through their facial expression vocalization and body movements infants express joy sadness anger surprise and fear
7662,In  Alexander Thomas and Stella Chess initiated a decadeslong study of temperament
7663,This studyfollowed infants throughout childhood and adolescence into early adulthood
7664,Theyidentified nine dimensions of temperament related to activity level and response tostimulation and stress
7665,These nine traits include activity level rhythmicity approachwithdrawal adapt ability attention span and persistence intensity of reaction threshold of responsiveness and quality of mood
7666,More recently Mary Rothbart simplified Thomas andChesss definition of temperament into two general categories reactivity and selfregulation
7667,Her specific temperament dimensions included activity level smiling andlaughter fear distress to limitations soothability and duration of orienting
7668,Temperament is least stablein the first two years of life
7669,Is temperament genetically based The pioneering research on temperament was conducted decades before the current revolution in genetic research
7670,At the time there was no real way to separate the effects ofenvironment from the effects of genes
7671,Therefore the concept of a genetically based temperament that is first evident inearly childhood and persists into adulthood is supported by current research
7672,Does environment affect temperament Although temperament is presumed to be largely inborn there is clear evidence thatit is affected by the environment
7673,Some of the temperament dimensions listed by bothThomas and Chess and Rothbart are highly influenced by parental behavior particu Handy Psychology     PM  Page larly the dimensions related to positive and negative emotion
7674,Moreover even geneti cally based traits can be strongly influenced by the environment
7675,For example highly anxious and fussy children are more vulnerable to developing anxiety disorders and depression
7676,If such children are gently encouraged to expandtheir tolerance for social stimulation they can avoid disabling social anxiety
7677,Whilethey will probably never become gregarious extroverts they can still develop socialcompetence
7678,Likewise extroverted and sensation seeking children are vulnerable todisorders of impulsivity such as substance abuse and aggressive andor illegal behavior
7679,Unlike furniture or food words are not useful objects in and of themselves
7680,Words areuseful only in their ability to symbolize something else
7681,Words take the child into the future and the past and to any place that can be imagined
7682,Prior to language theparent has to guess the childs wants and needs
7683,Are there precursors to language The precursors to language start in the first few months of life
7684,First the child mustdevelop the capacity for complex vocal sounds
7685,Over the rest of the first year the babblingbecomes increasingly complex and tailored to the native language of the child
7686,Aroundten months their babbling becomes strikingly melodic mimicking the intonation andrhythm of their native language
7687,In fact it can be quite amusing to listen to a tenmonthold baby clearly communicate emotion and intent in the complete absence of intelligible words
7688,Putting his elbow on the table he immediately started babbling
7689,Doo doo bah me mah he said with evident purpose
7690,Bus may include any vehicle of transportation that has wheels
7691,Bythe end of the second year word usage is more accurate and the child is combiningwords into twoword sequences
7692,At thispoint the child has a vocabulary of about  words
7693,Over the next year the childcombines more and more words together eventually forming full sentences
7694,Wordsare learned at a rate of about one to three words per week
7695,This is not to say that babies have no awareness of themselvesprior to this period
7696,From birth infants have some sense of their physical selves basedin part on the correspondence between their movements and physical sensations
7697,This giganticpsychological leap is evident in the first use of personal pronouns I me mine theemergence of selfconscious emotions shame embarrassment and the recognition ofthe mirror image
7698,They refer to themselvesas I or me and they refer to anything they possess or wish to possess as mine
7699,Prior to using personal pronouns toddlers might refer to themselves as baby or bytheir own name
7700,At this point caregivers must introduce the concept of sharing
7701,Toddlers must begin to learn about selfcontrol and social expectations
7702,One cannot feel shame if there is no self to feel bad about
7703,The emotions ofshame embarrassment pride and jealousy are recognizable from about eighteenmonths on
7704,While such emotions may be painful for the child theyare critical tools for socializing behavior
7705,Humans are profoundly social animals and achild needs to learn to inhibit various impulses and emotions in order to successfullyfunction in a social world
7706,Selfconscious emotions create an inborn motivational system to avoid social disapproval and to seek out social approval
7707,Inter estingly the mirror test has also been conducted on several species of great apes
7708,Only afraction of chimpanzees orangutans or gorillas pass the mirror test even as adults
7709,Ingeneral chimpanzees appear to do better than the other ape species on this test
7710,The toddler has discovered that he or she is an individual person with individualgoals
7711,In contrast infants respond to the world with generalized distress or contentment
7712,This desire toimpact the environment in line with the childs emotional responses is the basis of thewill
7713,Unfortunately once children discover their own willthey encounter the limits of their control
7714,Moreover ones will is not necessarily aligned with the will of others
7715,This is very upsetting to the child and frustration can escalate into  The mirror test tells us about the development of the childs concept of the self
7716,In the first year babies do not recognize t hemselves in the mirror image
7717,A baby is interested in the mirror but does not relate the reflection to the self
7718,In contrast an older child is well aware that the image in the mirror is her own reflection  iStock
7719,A temper tantrum should be distinguished from the dis tress expressed by a younger baby
7720,A temper tantrum is more than a simple reaction tonegative circumstances it is an angry defiant protest
7721,The temper tantrum occurs notonly because the child is frustrated over a particular event but because the child is outraged at the very existence of frustration
7722,In these moments children are enraged that they should have to be frustrated at all that their will can actually be thwarted
7723,It takes some time for toddlers to adapt to this cold hard truth
7724,During this time parents should be sensitive and patient with their child
7725,While they should refrainfrom needless power battles they should set appropriate limits even if its causes thechild to throw a temper tantrum
7726,Giving in to the tempertantrums of a child can undermine the childs development of frustration tolerance
7727,Vanessaspeaks in full sentences at two and a half and has clearly discovered the first personpossessive
7728,Her emphasis on the word my reflects a critical step in the developmentof the sense of self
7729,Her insistence on her privileged relationship with if not ownership of her mother also reflects the importance of motherchild attachment
7730,She does not realize that she cannot beboth granddaughter and grandfather to her own grandfather
7731,His emphasis on the sound that a bus makes Brrr reflects the importance of sensorymotor experience in the development of language
7732,His interest in the gender of the bus driver reflects his newfoundfascination with grown men
7733,At this age little boys first recognize their male gender
7734,This is a fundamental step in their individuation from their mother unlike theirmother they are boys not girls
7735,Grandpa Baba Vanessa dont you look cute today Vanessa Pause
7736,Baba is MYYYY granddaughter and MYYYY grandfather Uncle Daniel Do you want to talk on the phone to Susan Vanessa Susan Daniel is MYYYY uncle Uncle Daniel Vanessa Julie is my sister
7737,This interchange took place as he watched his sister go off to kindergarten in a school bus
7738,David Daya byebye brrrr man Daya byebye brrrr maan Mom Translating That means Vanessa is going off to school in a school bus driven by a man
7739,In particular they learn that they belong to a specific gender they are either a boy or a girl
7740,For little boys this is a fairly momentous discovery as their newly discovered masculinitymarks a dramatic break with their mother
7741,While little girls are girls likeMommy little boys are boys unlike Mommy
7742,Many little boys of this age become fascinated with adult men following them around like adoring puppies
7743,This is not an early sign of sexual orientation only the hero worship of a small boy toward a new role model
7744,There is a loss of body fat a lengtheningof the legs and arms and a flattening of the tummy
7745,With a longer body the child is nolonger all head and belly
7746,At this point the child looks like a kid and no longer like ababy
7747,Additionally there is continued rapid brain growth particularly in the left hemisphere the cerebellum and the frontal lobe
7748,This corresponds with rapid increases inlanguage motor coordination and cognition and selfcontrol in that order
7749,Improved language skills and the ability to count play games and even begin toread and write all reflect advances in the preschool childs cognition
7750,In Handy Psychology     PM  Page other words the preschool child is capable of imagination
7751,Not only can preschool children refer to something that is not present they can change it in their mind
7752,Thissignificant shift opens the door to pretend play to fantasy and even to lying
7753,Thus preschool children are prone to a kind of reasoning known as magical thinking
7754,The child develops hypotheses about causation that areunchecked by mature logic
7755,For example the superstitious saying if you step on acrack youll break your mothers back reflects magical thinking
7756,Likewise a childmight attribute the rain to Gods tears or thunder to giants moving furniture
7757,For example after the wind blows the door shut a child might say Mr
7758,In keeping with their tendency toward magical thinking children of this age are particularly drawn to fantasy stories
7759,The lack of clear distinction between fantasy and realitycan be a drawback
7760,Many preschool children become afraid of monstersin their closet at night
7761,Such a changeable world can be very scary at times
7762,They love to play dressup to pretend to be parents to play house or to imitate adult roles that they see in their life such as a teacher fireman or doctor
7763,Whilesome pretend play is evident in the toddler years it is much more elaborated in thepreschool years
7764,The understanding that all people have uniquemental perspectives develops graduallyacross childhood
7765,In the preschool yearschildren master the concept of false beliefs
7766,In other words children graspthat our beliefs are not equal to externalreality that one persons beliefs can bedifferent from another persons beliefsand that our beliefs shape our actions
7767,Development of this skill is a critical stepin socialization in the ability to manageinterpersonal relationships
7768,People with autism a psychiatric disorder characterized by interpersonal skills deficits arebelieved to lack adequate theory of mind
7769,While typical threeyearolds will point to the unmarked box the typical fouryearold will point to the marked box thus demonstrating an understandingof Pams false belief
7770,Although seeds of this process are evident in the toddler years we do not expect much in the way of selfcontrol in a child under the age ofthree
7771,Childrenthis age master various strategies for controlling their impulses and emotions
7772,In theface of negative emotions they learn to distract themselves or to change their goalsfor example abandoning a contested toy in favor of a new available toy
7773,The capacity for fantasy is one of the hallmarks of the preschool years  iStock
7774,Likewise their understanding of their own emotions and the emo tions of others increases
7775,Preschool children now have a basic capacity for peertopeer relationships
7776,In contrast preschool children are capable ofenduring emotionally important relationships with other children
7777,This is not to say that preschool friendships are completely mature
7778,At this age friendships are highly unstable and prone toconstant disruptions
7779,Minor conflict often leads to a declaration of the end of thefriendship Johnny isnt my friend anymore Luckily the bad times are generallyshort lived and once the storm passes the friendship resumes OK Johnny you canbe my friend again
7780,Despite his verbal skills he does not yet fully understand the rules of logicor the difference between reality and fantasy
7781,In contrast his older sister Alex is inPiagets stage of concrete operations
7782,Josh Dolphins can dance on their tails and flop onto their tummies
7783,Alex You cant be an an imal or a machine
7784,You have to be a man cause thats the way God made you
7785,A childthis age has a rudimentary concept ofright and wrong and of good and bad
7786,If an adult tells them a behavioris wrong particularly if they are punishedfor it they learn that the behavior is considered bad
7787,Moreover as their cognitive development progresses their moralunderstanding gains sophistication
7788,If parental discipline is overly rigid and harsh overly permissive orarbitrary and inconsistent children will be hampered in their understanding of rightand wrong
7789,By the age of six children spend eleven times as muchtime with samesex as oppositesex peers
7790,Although there is always considerable individual variation on average boys are more likely than girls to engage in roughandtumble play verbal and physical aggression and large group activities
7791,Girls on theother hand prefer activities that involve verbal interaction and fine motor skills andare more sensitive to emotional reactions both in themselves and in other children
7792,They are less likely to use physical vio lence but more likely to attempt to undermine others friendships disrupting the network of personal relationships that are so important for girls
7793,Gendertyped behavior  By the age of six both boys and girls tend to spend more time with samesex playmates than with the opposite sex
7794,Handy Psychology     PM  Page is strongly influenced by environment and there is tremendous variation across cul tures in the ways that the different genders are socialized
7795,Nonetheless there is alsostrong evidence of a biological basis to gender differences
7796,Sex hormones such asandrogens and estrogen seem to play an important role
7797,Otherwise known asmiddle childhood these are years of relative stability
7798,The child has mastered the cognitive linguistic emotional and social challenges of early childhood and is now capable of participating in the social world
7799,Schoolage children are ready to join societynot as independent participantschildren this age still need considerable adult supervisionbut as junior members of the social world
7800,They are capable of learning thefundamentals of adult work of building and managing peer relations and of understanding and respecting social rules
7801,Many parents find these the easiest years of parenting with the enormous demands of infancy and early childhood behind them andthe upheaval of adolescence yet to come
7802,Latencyaged children devote their energy to the mastery of skills particularly those taught in school
7803,Inferiority also speaks tothis observation suggesting that the latency years are focused on mastery with powerful implications for a childs basic sense of competence
7804,Thechild continues to grow in height and weight with most of their growth in the lowerpart of their body
7805,Children become longer and leaner continuing to stretch out fromthe rounded mass of head and belly characteristic of the infancy and toddler years
7806,Children make considerable advances in both grossmotor and fine motor skills
7807,Improvements in coordination balance flexibility andpower allow them to develop skills such as writing and drawing as well as to engagein complex and physically demanding sports
7808,While sixyearsolds may still have some trouble with conservation tasks by ageseven most children have a basic understanding of these concepts
7809,Schoolage children have a more sophis ticated sense of classification
7810,They understand that objects can belong to differentcategories and that categories can be hierarchically arranged
7811,For example a child cancollect baseball cards of lefthanded pitchers or of third basemen in the AmericanLeague
7812,They can also rearrange these categories to collect lefthanded pitchers in theAmerican League
7813,Their understanding of number of sequencing and of spatial relationships also grows
7814,Language also continues to develop and by the end of this stagechildren have an average vocabulary of  words
7815,Because of this ongoing cognitive development children are ready to learn skills needed for adult life
7816,Readingwriting and arithmetic are three academic skills that schoolage children have tomaster in industrialized and economically developed countries
7817,With their increasedcognitive capacities children have a growing understanding of emotions in boththemselves and others
7818,Schoolage children understand that people are motivated bytheir internal states rather than by situations alone
7819,Children this age also master theconcept of mixed feelings that people can have more than one emotion at a time
7820,Children advance in their ability to regulate their own emotions to tolerate frustration to delay gratification and to distract themselves from distress
7821,They understand that people suffer not only from momentaryfrustrations but also from longstanding life circumstances
7822,Their selfconscious emotions also advance heightening their social capacities but also opening upnew areas of psychological vulnerability
7823,Prior to the schoolageyears children have primary formative relationships with their adult caregivers
7824,Inthe preschool years they develop friendships with other children but are not undulyinfluenced by the inevitable crises of these relationships
7825,Entering this period childrenhave already mastered a rudimentary understanding of the minds of others the differ Handy Psychology     PM  Page ence between right and wrong and some degree of frustration tolerance and impulse control
7826,These critical skills continue to solidify in the schoolage years supportingthe development of peer relationships
7827,Children have developed a repertoire of tools to manage conflict in peer relationships such as sharing compromising helping and seeing thingsfrom anothers perspective
7828,Children develop enduring and close friendships thatcan last into adulthood
7829,While disrup tive children may be offputting in early childhood the social impact is transient andcan be easily rectified
7830,Additionally children are now relating to other children as part of a social group and not simply on a onetoone basis
7831,Schoolage children must therefore begin tonegotiate the complexities of group dynamics
7832,Such issues include ingroups and outgroups group hierarchy and social status leaders and followers and conformity andresistance to group norms
7833,Although such issues will be sharply accentuated in adolescence they are first encountered during the schoolage years
7834,Children can now understand the conceptof impersonal rules that all people have tofollow regardless of their preferences
7835,Ineffect schoolage children have an understanding of the social contract
7836,Unfortunately psychology has proven itself rather nave in this regard
7837,While some aggressive children are maladjusted emotionallytroubled and disliked by their peers other children use aggression quite effectively togain social status
7838,Boys are more likely than girls to bully other children using verbaland physical aggression
7839,More or less unchanged this game is found in multiple countries and across the United States
7840,The remarkable stability of these games reflects theimportance of rules for school age children and contrasts dramatically with theeverchanging nature of adolescent slang
7841,Miss Mary Mack Mack MackAll dressed in black black blackWith silver buttons buttons buttonsAll down her back back backShe asked her mother mother motherFor fifty cents cents centsTo see the elephant elephant elephant
7842,He jumped so high high highHe reached the sky sky skyAnd he never came back back backTill the end of July July July
7843,Overprotective parentsactually increase their childrens risk of being targeted by bullies by hampering theirindependence and selfconfidence and enhancing their sense of passivity and dependency
7844,While such children should never be blamed for the being victims they can benefitfrom interventions that increase their social skills assertiveness and initiative
7845,For onethe academic skills learned in the schoolage years form the foundation of all laterlearning
7846,If a child never masters reading he or she will be at a serious disadvantage
7847,In our informationbased society a high level of literacy is vital for occupational oreconomic success
7848,Perhaps even more importantly though a childs experience inschool powerfully influences his or her selfconcept
7849,Children at this age are capableof comparing themselves to others in a meaningful way
7850,They have some idea of socialstanding and of social categories
7851,Nonetheless they still tend to think in global terms and have some difficulty dis tinguishing whether their behavior reflects particular circumstances or a general personality trait
7852,In other words did they fail the test because they need new glasses andcouldnt read the blackboard or because theyre bad at math Thus childrens schoolexperience leads to a global generalized sense of their own competence
7853,If they feelbad at school their lowered selfconfidence will diminish their initiative and theirpersistence in the face of challenge
7854,If they feel good at school their positive selfconcept will enhance initiative frustration tolerance and selfdiscipline and alsoencourage higher academic and occupational goals
7855,For example some children have particular difficultyin maintaining focused attention e
7856,This can lead to low selfesteem and someassociated negative behaviors such as a defensive rejection of criticism
7857,Some children with undiagnosed learning disabilities feel so bombarded by criti cism and feelings of failure that they simply shut out negative feedback with predictable consequences
7858,Children with learning disabilities may develop disruptive PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPANHandy Psychology     PM  Page behaviors and have an increased risk of becoming involved in antisocial behaviors in adolescence
7859,To some extent this is related to biological deficits in impulse controlbut it is also related to problematic reactions after repeated experiences of failure
7860,The child becomes an adult and the body dramatically changesform frequently leaving young adolescents surprised and disoriented by their new andalien body
7861,While the typical American tenyearold is about the median height for seventeenyearolds is about  for boys and  for girls
7862,The shape of the body changes as well with lengthening of the trunk arms and legsand enlargement of the hands and feet
7863,The face also changes with growth of thenose jaw and cheekbones
7864,Often the ears and nose grow before the rest of the face
7865,In North American girls the growth spurt starts around ten and is completed byabout age sixteen
7866,In North American boys the growth spurt begins around twelveor thirteen and is completed by about seventeen or eighteen
7867,Most adolescents addabout ten inches in height and gain about fifty to seventyfive pounds
7868,Additionallythere are tremendous hormonal and physiological changes associated with puberty
7869,This takes place about two years earlier in girlsthan in boys
7870,Girls start puberty around age twelve and complete it in about fouryears
7871,In both sexes a flood of hormones is released by various glands in the body
7872,Growth hormone and thyroxine stimulate the increase in body size
7873,For boys most of the hormones are released by the testes
7874,The androgen or male hormone testosterone leads to muscle growth body and facial hair and the development of male sexual characteristics
7875,This in turn stimulates growth in bodysize and bone density
7876,By the end of puberty boys have developed greater muscle massthan girls and their shoulders have widened relative to their waist and hips
7877,Handy Psychology     PM  Page In girls hormones are released from the ovaries
7878,Estrogen release results in maturation of the breasts uterus andvagina an accumulation of body fat andan increase in the hip to waist ratio
7879,Ingirls but not boys androgen release fromthe adrenal glands right above the kidneys results in increased height as well asthe growth of pubic and underarm hair
7880,Early in adolescence there is marked growth in brain graymatter particularly in the frontal lobe
7881,Thisis caused by a burst of synaptogenesis thecreation of synaptic connections betweenneurons
7882,This enhances efficiency in thebrain by ridding the brain of unused circuitry like throwing out clothes that are never worn
7883,This increase in brain connectivity and efficiency results in profound changes in cognitive abilities bringing about a seismic shift inthe adolescents understanding of the world
7884,Additionally there are changes in the density of neurotransmitters the chemical messengers that help neurons communicate with each other
7885,Changes in the level ofexcitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate and dopamine relative to the level ofinhibitory neurotransmitters such as GABA may make adolescents more reactive toemotional stimuli possibly contributing both to the emotional turbulence and thrillseeking tendencies commonly found in adolescents
7886,Primarily thismeans that adolescents can reason from the possible instead of just the concrete and the PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPAN Everyone knows the body goes through tremendous physical changes during puberty including hair growth and increasedproduction of hormones that ready the body for sexualreproduction
7887,Such drastic changes can be a lot to adjust tomaking puberty a trying time in life  iStock
7888,Schoolage children can explain the behavior of objects that are directly in front of them
7889,In contrast adolescents canreason from the possible or hypothetical instead of just from the concrete or tangible
7890,They can reason in terms of verbal concepts such as social justice political conservatism or religious doctrine
7891,Likewise adolescents are capable of grasping the rules of logic as concepts in and of themselves
7892,Theycan critique the logic of another persons argument a skill that was not available tothem during the schoolage period
7893,A twoyearold rebels by shouting No No No An eightyearold pouts and cries Thats notfair But a sixteenyearold can point out contradictions in their parents arguments
7894,Of course these cognitive capacities arestill in their earliest stages of development in early adolescence and do not reach fullflower until late adolescence
7895,In fact the capacity for abstract thought continues togrow well into adulthood
7896,Likewise full development of these cognitive abilities isheavily dependent on environment on the adolescents exposure to relevant educationand experience
7897,Nonetheless adolescents are capable of learning about theory in ways younger children simply cannot grasp
7898,They can learn about religion philosophy mathematics politics and sociology
7899,For the first time adolescents can develop their own ideasabout these topics and not simply parrot the opinions of their parents
7900,Although adolescents are capable of understanding these abstract concepts their viewpoints stilldiffer from those of adults
7901,They tend toward grand generalizations particularly insocial and political ideas with little appreciation for complexity and nuance
7902,In factthere is a saying about adolescents understanding of politics that has been attributedto various people including Winston Churchill and Victor Hugo
7903,Their ability to put themselves in Handy Psychology     PM  Page others shoes to take anothers perspective continues to develop
7904,Moreover they rec ognize that there are levels of human behavior and motivation
7905,There can be feelings that are covered by apublic mask
7906,Its almost as if everyonearound them has developed Xray vision and they are suddenly naked
7907,The intense selfconsciousness of the typical adolescent is well known
7908,Young ado lescents in particular become extremely selfconscious about their appearance andare prone to mortifying feelings of embarrassment
7909,The wrong shoelaces pant lengthhair styleall of these can trigger a crisis of selfconsciousness as well as peerridicule
7910,These difficulties are at their height in early adolescence in the first half ofthe teens
7911,Older adolescents recognize that regardless of the visibility of their personal quirks and foiblessuch matters are of little or no interest to the rest of the world
7912,Most people are far toowrapped up in their own concerns to waste precious energy and attention on anotherpersons minor imperfections
7913,Older adolescents also realize that their inner strugglesand failures are far from unique
7914,Thus there is little reason to feel shame since theseexperiences are widely shared
7915,For thefirst time in their lives adolescents are challenged to develop a view of themselves thatis separate from their relationship with their parents
7916,Moreover adolescents cognitivedevelopment allows them to understand abstract notions of values and of religious andpolitical beliefs
7917,The beliefs they endorse become an important part of their identity
7918,This process of identity formation also relates to an excessive concern with peer acceptance
7919,Alternatively certain subgroups of thepopulation may be barred from productive participation in society due to poverty lack of PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPANHandy Psychology     PM  Page education andor racial or ethnic prejudice
7920,Forexample disenfranchised youths particularly young males may be inducted into streetgangs or criminal organizations
7921,As such psychological development in adolescence isheavily dependent on the surrounding culture more so than at any earlier period
7922,The upsurge in hormones the changes in brain function and the adolescents own psychological reactions to massive physical cognitive and social changes all contribute to this emotional upheaval
7923,Adolescents are known to be moody dramatic and to react intensely to seeming ly minor problems
7924,Likewise this is a time of increased vulnerability to mental illness
7925,In fact many psychological and psychiatric disorders have their start in adolescence including depression eating disorders drug abuse and even schizophrenia
7926,This is not to suggest that all adolescents develop emotional problems quite theopposite in fact
7927,Both parent and child must find a way to renegotiate the relationship so that thechilds growing independence is not stifled but the child is not allowed too muchfreedom
7928,Parents and adolescents conflict over the teens desire for greaterprivacy for reduced discipline for greater freedom to choose friends and to spendtime with them away from home
7929,We can con Handy Psychology     PM  Page trast the rapid changes in adolescent slang with the conservative nature of school aged childrens games
7930,Relationships with peers acceptance by peers and the adolescents role andstatus in peer groups become of utmost importance
7931,Secondly the adolescents increased perspectivetaking capacitiesand greater understanding of emotional life allow for a level of intimacy with peers thatwas not possible earlier
7932,As adolescents gain better understanding of their own motivations and emotional experience they have greater capacity for empathy
7933,The ability and desire to share intimate experience creates intense bonds between friends
7934,Many styles that become popular with adolescents reflect rejectionof basic adult norms and assumptionsabout selfpresentation
7935,For examplefrom earliest childhood parentsteach their children that clothesshould be neat clean orderly andattractive and should promote asocially acceptable image
7936,The goth style promotes a morbidimage of violence and religious transgression
7937,These rebellious styles oftenexude a good deal of vitality and frequently become absorbed and diluted into mainstream fashion
7938,The tendency toward chumship or intense samesex friendships in early adoles cence is slowly supplanted by romantic relationships in later adolescence althoughsamesex friendships retain great importance throughout adolescence
7939,We are all familiar with the phenomena of cliques popularity peer pressureand terms such as coolness and geekiness
7940,Just as wolf packs organize into hierarchies of social statusHandy Psychology     PM  Page so do human societies
7941,Boundaries between the in group and the out group andbetween the elite and low status individuals are communicated fluently through a system of everchanging symbols
7942,Group etiquette and rituals are reflected in languageclothing cars electronic gadgets and taste in music
7943,Consider the market for luxury cars and designer clothes as well as the importance of occupational and financial success to many adults selfesteem
7944,They are also better able to distinguish betweensocial relationships that truly matter to them and those that have less relevance totheir daily lives
7945,In general sexual maturity precedes emotional maturity and young teens are often faced with feelings and social demandsthat they are not emotionally ready for
7946,The age of puberty has come earlier and earlier over the past century
7947,Moreover in our highly complex industrialized society thefull adult role is reached far later than in simpler societies
7948,Boys may be under pressure to prove their manhood and possibly to be sexually active beforethey feel ready for it
7949,Likewise the intense sex drive of the adolescent male alongwith their concern with promoting a masculine identity may lead to irresponsibleand dangerous sexual behavior or behavior that is inadequately sensitive to theneeds of the partner
7950,There ispressure to engage in sexual activity in order to be cool to maintain male atten Handy Psychology     PM  Page tion or to prove that one is not a child
7951,There is also pressure to avoid being labeled as promiscuous
7952,Despite many changes in sex roles over the past few decades the sexually promis cuous female is often still stigmatized
7953,Alternatively adolescents may feel ready toengage in sexual behavior but face restrictions on their behavior from parents peersor culture
7954,Sexual mores for adolescents have undergone many changes in recentdecades
7955,Because of this cultural flux sexual development in adolescents can presentmany challenges
7956,Adolescents benefit most from careful thoughtful and open discussion with adults about the risks and rewards of sexual activity
7957,They drive cars at fast speeds drive while intoxicated imbibe massive amountsof alcohol or illicit drugs break laws get into fights have unsafe sex and engage in manyother highrisk behaviors
7958,As the saying goes adolescents seem to believe they areimmortal
7959,While this phenomenon is well recognized it is not fully understood
7960,For one the myelination of the frontal lobe is not completeuntil the midtwenties
7961,Thus the parts of the brain responsible for impulse control andthe consideration of consequences are not fully developed
7962,Further the surge of testosterone particularly in males probably increases thrillseeking behavior
7963,There is evidence that the emotional parts of the brain are more reactive as well
7964,The combination of increased thrill seeking with inadequate impulse control can be acombustible mix
7965,The heightened emphasis on peerapproval in adolescence along with the desire to establish independence fromparental authority encourages adolescents to forcefully and publicly assert their independence
7966,Caution and selfcontrol can thus become a sign of childish dependency apotential source of great embarrassment and a target for peer ridicule
7967,Does culture influence our understanding of adolescence Although there are many biological influences on adolescent psychology adolescencedoes not take place in a cultural vacuum
7968,The very concept of adolescence is a relatively recent one
7969,Earlier in our history there was less recognition of a transitional periodbetween childhood and adulthood
7970,Marriage childbearing and occupational maturitytook place during the teen years
7971,Although there was recognition of the special characteristics of youth a period extending roughly from adolescence into early adulthood most people took on an adult role within their society in their teens
7972,As oursociety has become more complex more and more time is needed to prepare for adultparticipation in society
7973,Consequently adolescence has come to be seen as uniqueperiod to be distinguished from both childhood and adulthood
7974,PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPANHandy Psychology     PM  Page Do cultures vary with regard to the emphasis on peers Cultures vary significantly with regard to the emphasis on peers
7975,In cultures that place high value on interdependence and family ties and less value on selfsufficiencyand independence peer relationships are less central to adolescent development
7976,Additionally there is greater respect for authority and less tolerance for nonconformity
7977,As Whay are adolescents so drawn to social networking sites Adolescents are known for their emphasis on peer relationships and identityformation
7978,With recent advances in telecommunications and Internet tech nology adolescents can now remain in almost constant contact through textmessaging or Internet social networking sites
7979,Two of the most popular websites Facebook and MySpace allow participants to craft and promote a social identity by posting pictures videos and text on theirown Web pages
7980,Additionally they can add comments to their friends Web pages
7981,The following quotes were culled from various high school students pages on Facebook
7982,Any identifying information has been removed or changed to protect confidentiality
7983,Note the playful and dramatic tone as well as the abbreviations careless spelling and emphasis on music clothing and technical gadgets
7984,I totally need a new dress  AmeliAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHandy Psychology     PM  Page a significant emphasis is placed on individuality and independence in the United States peer relationships have assumed tremendous importance in the lives of manyadolescents
7985,Relatedly there is more tolerance of challenges to authority rebellionand nonconformity in American culture than in more traditional cultures
7986,He or she is biologically cognitively and socially prepared to take on an adultrole within society
7987,Young adults must achieve some degree of emotional and financial individuation from parents
7988,This does not mean that they need to cut ties withtheir parents only that the nature of their relationship should change from that ofdependency to greater equality
7989,Young adults need to achieve some degree of financial independence
7990,Many young adults are still in school even in their mid to late twenties and thus are hamperedfrom earning a full living
7991,Nonetheless they are working toward financial independence and often have an independent source of income even if they cannot work fulltime
7992,Additionally they should be learning to budget pay bills pay taxes and otherwise handle their money independently
7993,This is also a time of embarking on new intimate attachments
7994,Longterm roman tic relationships are established and most people get married during this period
7995,Many people also become parents in early adulthood and thus undertake enormousresponsibility for the lives and development of their dependent children
7996,Finally this is a time of establishing a career path
7997,Although social roles in West ern society have become much more flexible in recent decades and young adults typically make multiple changes in their work and romantic life choices still need to bemade that have farreaching consequences
7998,For example the choice to marry and havechildren with a particular partner will have lifelong implications even if the marriageends in divorce
7999,Likewise the choice to pursue higher education or a particular careerpath has extensive influence on later life
8000,This may take different forms in different cultures and subcultures
8001,In cultures that emphasize independence and self sufficiency there may be less contact with parents and less dependence PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPANHandy Psychology     PM  Page on them for advice guidance and determination of values and beliefs
8002,In cultures that emphasize family ties and traditional relationships there is less expectation of physical separation and greater respect for parental opinions
8003,Young adults must take on more responsibility for the supportof themselves and others and they are more capable of independent decisions
8004,In Western society young adults are expected to differentiate their own desires beliefs valuesand goals from those of their parents
8005,Often this is a complicated process as manyparental attitudes are not explicit and have been unconsciously absorbed over time
8006,Ultimately an important psychologicaltask of this period is to achieve an understanding of parents as threedimensionalhumans limited and flawed but precious for their unconditional love
8007,In modern Western society this generally involves taking on arole in the work force deciding on and embarking upon an occupational path
8008,At earlier points in history there was little choice in ones occupation
8009,For most members of society there is a smorgasbord of occupational choices and young adults can often feelbewildered by the sheer number of options
8010,Ones choice of occupation has farreachingimplications for ones personal identity social role financial wellbeing and general quality of life
8011,Consequently young adults make choices based on stereotyped viewsof success and career gratification with little life experience of their own to guide them
8012,The perceived number of options is also a function of education and social class
8013,Not all adolescents will feel that highstatus and highincome professions are available for them
8014,Nonetheless the choice to complete high school and even to entersome form of postsecondary education is possible for many members of Western society
8015,Thus across socioeconomic groups young adults must grapple with the task ofchoosing an occupational path
8016,Commitment to marriage or other forms of longterm romantic relationships brings a host of challenges
8017,Thus the necessary compromises and sacrifices of commitment can present considerable problems
8018,Moreover even in those people eager to find acommitted relationship it often takes time and experience to identify those traits in apotential partner that are most important to sustain a longterm relationship
8019,Once a committed relationship isattained there are numerous relationship skills that need to be developed
8020,The difficulty of these tasksis reflected in the divorce rate
8021,out of every  people get married each year and about
8022,While this is the lowest divorce rate since it is still remarkably high
8023,Although young adults may be living entirely independently withan established career and a mature set of social relationships they may still think ofthemselves as a kid and not a real adult
8024,A small helpless baby is utterly dependent on the new parent andthere is no more hiding from the reality of adult responsibilities
8025,Most people findthat for the first time in their lives their responsibility to another person is as greator greater than their responsibility to themselves
8026,While this level of selfsacrifice canbe very stressful for new parents especially very young ones many experience it as anopportunity for tremendous growth and maturity
8027,At the same time many new parents renegotiatetheir relationship with their own parents gaining new appreciation for their knowledge and experience
8028,Young people must establish a multifaceted adult identity committo deeper and more mature relationships and take on financial emotional and socialresponsibilities
8029,In so doing the young adult opens up opportunities for great satisfaction and fulfillment for greater control and empowerment and for improved socialstatus and respect
8030,In effectgrowing up means giving up the security of depending on parents the freedom of alife without commitment and responsibility and the illusion that it is possible to avoidfailure
8031,These present real psychological challenges and few young adults progresssmoothly along each line of development
8032,It is normal to have some spottiness across different developmental lines
8033,In this case young adults may become progressively more depressed as the distance between themselves and their peers becomes more and more apparent withtime
8034,In both these movies young adults idle aimlessly frustrated with their lack of forward momentum but unable to acceptthe inevitable compromises necessitated by an adult role in society
8035,Thesemight include the age of marriage bearing children attaining a first job buying ahouse andor completing education
8036,Although the settings for a social clock will varyacross cultures Neugarten suggests that all cultures have some form of agebasedexpectations of task performance
8037,For example many women expect to marry and have children ona timescale similar to that of their mothers
8038,census report theproportion of nevermarried people aged thirty to thirtyfour was over  percent
8039,In  he published a book entitled Seasons in a Womans Life using Handy Psychology     PM  Page similar methodology with a sample of women
8040,Even though his samples were small and largely limited to upperincome people his thoughts about adult development areworth considering
8041,These include early adulthood age twentytwo to forty middle adulthood age forty to sixty and late adulthood age sixty and up
8042,Levinson suggests that the first stage early adulthood ischaracterized by the creation of the initial life structure
8043,This is a period of great excite ment and satisfaction but also of notable uncertainty and anxiety
8044,To Levinson adultdevelopment involves a series of fluctuations between the creation and rearrangementof life structures
8045,A life structure refers to the entire design of a persons life includingpsychological traits social relationships and work life
8046,In general the transition between adolescence and adulthood can be anxietyprovoking
8047,People at this stage of life often feel considerableanxiety about taking on the risks and responsibilities of creating an adult lifestructure
8048,Fear of failure or of being trapped in a deadend or soulcrushingcareer can feed a desire to prolong the carefree aimless days of adolescence
8049,Two popular American movies that came out in the s address the emo tional difficulties some young adults have in making the transition from adolescence to early adulthood
8050,Clerks starring Brian OHalloran and Jeff Anderson and Reality Bites starring Winona Ryder Ethan Hawke Janeane Garofolo and Ben Stiller both play with the humor and pathos of this stage of life
8051,At the age thirty transition people have the opportunity to evaluate their life as lived so far
8052,For the first time in their life they have a past as an adult as wellas a future
8053,In the culminating phase to  the initial life structure is brought to fruition
8054,The adult experiences both thegratifications and the disappointments in life as it has turned out to be
8055,He believed that this stage depended upon a successful resolution of the previous stage identity vs
8056,Erikson believed that it is necessary tohave a stable personal identity a secure sense of self in order to establish a committed intimate relationship
8057,In an intimate partnership one has to open up ones identity to another person
8058,To some extent intimacy involves the merger of ones sense ofself with that of the other person
8059,If a secure sense of self has not been achieved itremains too threatening to loosen the reins and let another person in
8060,Such people may engage in many shortterm relationships or avoid monogamous relationships
8061,In fact the popular book Passages by Gail Sheehy was based heav ily on his research
8062,Like Levinson Gould conceptualized adult development as unfolding in a series of predictable stages
8063,Gouldproposed that the early adult years age eighteen to thirtyfive were characterized byseveral psychological illusions that are slowly relinquished over time
8064,He was particularly interested in the illusion of absolute safety
8065,One of the cardinal experiences of all human beings involves the fear of death
8066,Our drive is toward life and we are terrified at the prospect of the annihilation of life ofdeath
8067,In early adulthood the illusion of absolute safety is transferred to the fantasy ofthe one right path
8068,This path will lead to the prize to absolute safety
8069,Young adultsanxiously and desperately seek this one true path ever fearful of making a mistake of Handy Psychology     PM  Page going down the wrong path
8070,There is still considerable vigor and vitality in middle adulthood as well as considerable potential for psychological growth
8071,Middleaged adults confront a loss of physical strength and energyminor aches and pains that occur more easily and take longer to go away than everbefore and various losses in sensory and cognitive abilities
8072,There isgreater emotional maturity as well an understanding of ones self and others in moretempered and thoughtful ways
8073,There is a loss of lean body mass including both muscle and bone and a concomitant gain in body fat
8074,On average womensabdomens increase by about thirty percent and mens by about ten percent from earlyto middle adulthood
8075,There are also changes in the layers of the skin such that elasticity is lost the skin loosens and wrinkles form
8076,Gray hair is caused by a reduction ofmelanin in the hair follicles
8077,There are also important changes in the reproductive system especially for women
8078,Menopause occurs on average at age fiftyone but most women experience considerablehormonal changes for several years before
8079,These changes affect sleep temperature regulation bone density and sexual function
8080,It is important to note that physical health inmiddle adulthood is strongly influenced by healthrelated behaviors
8081,The lens of the eye becomes less flexible reducing the abil PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPANHandy Psychology     PM  Page ity of the eye to focus on close objects
8082,People in their forties frequently have difficulty reading due to presbyopia
8083,They must hold reading material at arms length to focuson the letters
8084,Consequently many people this age buy reading glasses for the firsttime
8085,There are also changes in hearing although these are not as noticeable as thechanges in vision
8086,Loss of sensitivity to highpitched sounds can begin in middleadulthood although hearing loss is generally more pronounced in later adulthood
8087,Fluid intelligence refers to raw processing power specifically aspects of attention memory and processing speed
8088,Crystallized intelligence refers to learned skills including funds of information verbal knowledge and knowledge ofsocial conventions
8089,On the other hand crystallized intelligence increases steadilythroughout middle adulthood
8090,In fact aspects of complex reasoning verbal abilityand spatial processing peak in middle adulthood and only slowly decline thereafter
8091,Older adults have aricher broader and more integrated understanding of the world at large
8092,For example if a chess master can recognizefamiliar configurations of chess pieces there is less need to memorize the positions ofeach chess piece on the board
8093,Middleaged adults often feelstress due to the numerous responsibilities they face but they are relatively free of theexistential angst that characterizes earlier periods
8094,As several theorists have noted in adolescence and early adulthood mortality is often theoretical at best
8095,Adolescents are known for their illusionsof immortality resulting at times in a reckless disregard for danger
8096,While young adults do not believe they areimmortal neither does death feel entirely real
8097,Many people of the prior generation die parents aunts and uncles older friends and colleagues and the parents of friends
8098,Some people of the adults own generation die as well
8099,In the context ofthese direct encounters with mortality death can no longer remain an abstraction
8100,In some people the confrontation with mortality in midlife can lead to panic and a frantic denial of aging and death
8101,To a small child an hour seems like an eternity
8102,By early adulthood time has sped up considerablyfrom early childhood but the young adult still experiences time as relatively static
8103,While the future exists in theory only the present feels real
8104,In contrast by midlife every year is a much smaller fraction of the adults entire life span
8105,Time seems to flow faster and faster almost as if the person iswalking on a moving sidewalk and the surrounding landscape is speeding upwith every step
8106,Because of this middle aged adults have a less static sense oftime
8107,They experience themselves and their world in a sense of flux
8108,The presentis a moving target and the future is just around the bend
8109,Likewise middle agedadults are often surprised by the speed that the present retreats into the past

8111,Even though it maybe possible to change tracks it may not be worth the cost in time money or sheerenergy
8112,For some people there might be feelings of being trapped
8113,For othersthere may be anger and disappointment at lost opportunities
8114,Optimally the confrontation with limitations in ones life promotes greater psychological maturity
8115,Difficult decisions must be made disappointments must be accepted and priorities mustbe realigned to make the best of life as it is not as we think it should be
8116,Because ofthis middleaged adults are likely to have a greater sense of self assurance than are adolescents and younger adults
8117,To the extent the adult has had experiences of success ofmastering challenges and accomplishing goals there are gains in selfconfidence
8118,In midlife one also has to confront ones own limitations
8119,The dreams of youth must be reconciled with the reality of life as lived
8120,To the extent that the discrepanciesbetween ideals and reality can be accepted there is greater selfacceptance and morestable selfesteem
8121,There can be a sense of liberty from the tyranny of youthful expectations
8122,Adults at this stage of life often have ongoing parenting responsibilities withchildren still living at home
8123,At the same time their parents are aging and frequentlyneed care
8124,Due to their greater experience and psychological maturity middleagedadults are ideally positioned to assume greater responsibility in the workplace
8125,Assumption of such supervisory rolesbrings to mind Eriksons stage of Generativity vs
8126,If the children are adolescents the parent will need to offer some supervision to the child but also allow them a good degree offreedom from parental control
8127,Finding the right balance is a difficult challenge asmany adolescents are prone to recklessness and their judgment is far from mature
8128,Parents in midlife need to findareas of fulfillment in their life that are independent of their parenting role
8129,This is toensure that the parents dependence on the parental role does not interfere with thechilds developmental need for greater independence
8130,As their parents physical and cognitive abilities deteriorateadult children must take on a caretaking role
8131,PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPAN One of the cardinal challenges of middle adulthood involves the confrontation with mortality and the loss of the youthful body
8132,Changes in modern technology such as plastic surgery collagen injections and Botox injections can prolong physical beauty
8133,This in turn undermines the psychological maturity deriv ed from acknowledgment and acceptance of the inevitable limits in life  iStock
8134,Handy Psychology     PM  Page Psychologically the role reversal between elderly parent and middleaged child can be difficult
8135,Besides the obvious stress of the new responsibilities there is a sense of sadness at the loss of the parental figure
8136,Even though the middleaged adult is fullymature and handles significant responsibilities it is still upsetting to realize there areno more grownups to fall back upon
8137,This demands a renegotiation of the adults relationshipwith work marriage family and many other aspects of life
8138,In women the illusion of absolute safety was more likely to manifest in a sense of self as helplessly dependent on a man
8139,Although many women felttrapped by their lack of autonomy the acceptance of greater selfdetermination was anxietyprovoking
8140,It stripped away the comforting illusion of the male as the omnipotentprotector
8141,Remaining ignorant of a disturbing reality forces people to constrict their own selfexperience impoverishing their personality
8142,Fortunately midlife provides an opportunity forpeople to enhance their psychological potential by shedding their denial of mortality
8143,Primarily a nuisance in middle adulthood they begin to truly interfere with everydayfunctioning in late life
8144,But it is important to distinguish between different stages ofthis last phase of life
8145,Some also speak of the oldest old those over eightyfive
8146,There is decreased cell regeneration and deterioration in cell DNA and RNA
8147,Brain cells also deteriorate with decreased neurogenesis new neurongrowth and general shrinkage of brain tissue
8148,There is musculoskeletal deteriorationwith continued loss of muscle mass and bone density
8149,Thickening of the lens of the eyecontinues to reduce vision
8150,Difficultiesmaking sense of conversation can leave the elderly feeling socially isolated
8151,Additional changes take place in the gastrointestinal cardiovascular respiratory and endocrine systems
8152,Chronic diseases become much more common at this stage inlife particularly diabetes hypertension and arthritis
8153,Perhaps even to a greater extent than at youngerages exercise diet positive mood stimulating mental activities and positive socialrelationships can promote optimal functioning
8154,Although this stage can cover many years it still marks the closing ofthe life story
8155,Adults in late life must alsoconfront the unavoidable reality of mortality and hopefully come to accept theinevitability of death
8156,Luckily older adults are often wellequipped emotionally to handle these daunt ing psychological challenges
8157,In general adults in late life have a more positive outlook are less prone to negative emotional reactions and are less egocentric thanyounger people
8158,The storied wisdom of the old is both a function of life experience anda buffer against life experience
8159,Adults in late life incur a significant amount oflosses including their job health and status and role in society
8160,Additionallymedical conditions that are more frequent in late life such as stroke and dementiacan cause depressive symptoms
8161,PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPANHandy Psychology     PM  Page Elderly people often express their depression through somatic complaints com plaints about physical problems and frequently have sleep problems and markedly reduced energy initiative and appetite
8162,The resulting selfneglect can put the elderly depressed person in real danger
8163,In fact the risk of suicide is five times higher inwhite men over the age of sixtyfive than in the general population
8164,Nonethelessdespite their exposure to multiple losses in general the elderly have a lower rate ofdepression than do younger groups
8165,This has been attributed to the greater emotionregulation and coping skills of older adults
8166,With increasing age there is generally a reduction in impulsiveimpetuous behavior and emotional volatility along with an improved ability to seethings from others perspectives
8167,In many cultures the elderly are valued for theirwise advice
8168,If the older adult is in relatively good health particularly in the earlierstages of late adulthood there is enhanced opportunity for enjoyable leisure activities
8169,By this he meant that adults at this stage are facing the end of their life
8170,Manydecisions have been made life has been largely lived and it has brought both disappointments and rewards
8171,Life will soon be over and there are no more chances
8172,In this stage in the ninth or tenth decade of life peo ple begin to look beyond their own individual lifespan
8173,Several other theorists such as Heinz Kohut Daniel Levinsonand Bernice Neugarten also write about the need in late life to come to terms withboth the positive and negative aspects of ones life as lived as well as the losses ofaging the diminished role of the self and the impending end of life
8174,For others retirement offers theopportunity to explore new interests and old passions spend more time with friendsand family and give back to the community through volunteer work or socially meaningful parttime work
8175,census data in  people aged sixtyfive and older comprised four percent of thepopulation while those aged eightyfive and over comprised only
8176,This raises concerns about the ability of governments or corporations tofund retirement pensions
8177,Lessening that concern are the same factors that accountfor the increased lifespan in the first place
8178,The advances in medical technology nutrition and lifestyle that have increased longevity also increase the vigor and productivity of seniors particularly the youngold in their sixties and early seventies
8179,In fact many people reenter the work forcesoon after retirement in volunteer or parttime positions if not fulltime jobs
8180,Middleaged adults deal with the death of their parents and other people intheir parents generation
8181,Elderly adults deal with the death of people in their owngeneration their spouses siblings and longtime friends
8182,While middleaged adultsconfront the reality of future death adults in late life recognize their own death maybe coming soon
8183,Of course the period of late life plays into this
8184,Healthy adults intheir midsixties can expect to live into their eighties eightyone for males andeightysix for females according to the U
8185,Census Bureau while people in theirninth and tenth decade of life are looking at a much shorter time horizon
8186,For one social support PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPANHandy Psychology     PM  Page retains its critical importance
8187,Although the size of peoples social circles tends to decrease with age and many older adults spend less time with acquaintances in favorof family and close friends the quality of social relationships has a powerful impact onthe sense of wellbeing
8188,Secondly engagement in meaningful and satisfying activitiessuch as hobbies creative work volunteer work or even parttime jobs are crucialsources of satisfaction for adults in late life
8189,Involvement in productive work of some kind enhances selfesteem and a sense of belonging
8190,Even thirty minutes a day of walking can have clear measurable benefits
8191,Physical exercise promotes cardiovascular health muscle strength and bone density
8192,There is considerable evidence that physical exercise is protective against dementia
8193,Their advice is sought in many matters and valued for its wisdom
8194,People live inlarge extended families and grandparents often contribute to the care of grandchildren
8195,Advances in medical technology haveincreased the health and physical strength of older people making such endeavors possible
8196,Handy Psychology     PM  Page nuclear family has replaced the extended family
8197,People are more mobile move resi dences more often and adult children can live hundreds if not thousands of milesaway from their parents
8198,Further working women do not have the time to providefulltime care for aging parents
8199,Thus the place of the elderly in society has undergone great disruption
8200,For one there has beengrowth of governmentsponsored elder care services including nursing homes adulthomes home health aides and adult day care centers
8201,Secondly there has been anextension of activities previously associated with earlier periods of life such as travelsports continuing education and paid or unpaid work far into late life
8202,Seniorstoday are likely to be more activephysically economically and sociallythan theirparents were
8203,Crystallized intelligence fund of information verbal skills vocabulary remains intact for much longer
8204,Eventually perhaps in the ninth or tenth decade oflife crystallized intelligence also starts to decline
8205,Although we do expect some intellectual decline with normal aging severe intellectual decline is not a part of normalaging but rather a symptom of dementia
8206,The two most common forms of dementia are Alzheimers disease and vascular dementia
8207,The biology of Alzheimers is characterized by the buildup of amyloidplaques and neurofibrillary tangles in and around the neuron brain cell
8208,Alzheimers starts with memory impairment and then generalizes to a broad range of cognitiveimpairments sufficiently severe to leave people unable to care for themselves
8209,Dementia is fairly rare in the midsixties about ten percent but becomes quite common by the eighties and nineties
8210,By some estimates  percent of all people over have Alzheimers disease
8211,Consequently virtually all families will be touched bydementia at some point
8212,Given the growing population of elderly peopleacross the industrialized world significant resources will be needed for elder care inthe coming years
8213,With many potentially complicatingvariables held constant such as smoking alcohol use quality of health care andincome it is much easier to have confidence in the research results
8214,David Snowdon the studys lead researcher began the study in  with a population of  nuns
8215,Remarkably the convent had preserved the essays the nuns wrote uponentering the convent in their teens or early twenties
8216,Finally the nuns gave theirpermission for their brains to be autopsied after death
8217,This is critical as theonly way to definitively diagnose Alzheimers disease is through brain autopsy
8218,Although the study is ongoing several noteworthy findings have already been published
8219,More educated nuns also had a lower chance of developing Alzheimers
8220,Do theessays reflect the earliest manifestations of Alzheimers or good habits that ultimately protect against the disease The autopsy data give clues to this  question
8221,Although the degree of brain damage due to neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques did correlatewith the degree of cognitive decline it was not a  percent correlation
8222,The researchers concluded that there was something known as cognitive reserve that protected against functional deterioration in the face of brain dis ease
8223,They believed that various factors contributed to cognitive reserve bypromoting richer neuronal networks or enhanced communication betweenbrain cells and greater cerebrovascular health
8224,Such factors seem to include education positive mood mental stimulation and healthy diet specificallythe vitamin folate
8225,Cerebrovascular health is very important because the presence of strokes dramatically reduced the cognitive performance of nuns withAlzheimers disease
8226,Because of a number of societal changes there is now more interest in the nature and quality of death and dying at least in the devel oped world
8227,Such changes include the growth of the elderly population cultural shiftstoward greater openness about distressing topics and longer intervals from the onset ofterminal illnesses to death
8228,Thanatologists work closely with the health care system toimprove the process of dying both for the dying patient and the surviving family
8229,Probably first and foremost is the issue of physicalpain and discomfort
8230,For both dying patients and their families it is critically important that the last days are physically comfortable
8231,In response the medical disciplineof palliative care has arisen to address the comfort of the terminally ill
8232,Other domains include the social psychological and spiritual realms of experi ence as well as the degree of preparation for death
8233,Social factors pertain to theinvolvement support and cohesion of or conversely conflict between family members
8234,Psychological factors include a sense of closure regarding life as lived and theawareness and acceptance of death
8235,Ideally the person will feel relatively at peace atthe time of death
8236,Preparation for death also includes planning inadvance for the medical legal and financial issues that are likely to follow
8237,In thebeginning of a life threatening illness people hope for recovery to survive the illnessor at least to prolong life
8238,As the reality of death grows closer it is important to transform the nature of hope
8239,The hope of avoiding death can be translated into the hope offinding and achieving a sense of meaning of reaching the conviction that ones lifehas had value and that death will be faced with dignity and integrity
8240,Her work was based on studies of the termi PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPANHandy Psychology     PM  Page nally ill
8241,While her model has been criticized her descriptions of the five stages of grief are still highly influential and provide a good overview of the variety of emotionalexperiences people undergo while grieving
8242,The five stages of grief are as followsdenial anger bargaining depression and acceptance
8243,This anger may be expressed at doctors at family or even at themselves
8244,It is as though they are looking for a place to puttheir anger at their illness
8245,They try to bargain withdoctors friends family and even God
8246,By holding onto the belief that they can changethe outcome of their illness through good behavior they try to maintain a sense ofcontrol
8247,Ultimatelythe person absorbs the intense and devastating shock of their terminal illness
8248,Nonetheless many people do experience the states of mind that KblerRoss describes
8249,In a series of publications from the s to the s JohnBowlby the father of attachment theory collaborated with Colin Murray Parkes tocondense KblerRosss five stages into four phases of grief
8250,Their four phases are as follows Shock and disbelief searching and yearning dis organization and despair and rebuilding and healing
8251,Thus the bereaved must undergo a process of recognizing the loss experiencing the acute pain of the loss and thenslowly rebuilding life and relationships so as to continue on without the loved one
8252,William Worden developed a similar approach speaking less of the phases than thetasks of grief
8253,Other theorists such as Robert Neimeyer and Alan Wolfelt write of related issuessuch as the need to rebuild an identity independent of the lost relationship and totransfer the relationship with the deceased out of daily life and into memory
8254,Is there research on the grief process Although there are a fair number of theories about the process of grief there has beenless in the way of actual scientific data about the normal course of grief
8255,In  Paul Handy Psychology     PM  Page Maciejewski and colleagues published a study of  bereaved adults conducted over a twentyfourmonth period
8256,They administered measures of yearning disbelief angerdepression and acceptance at three time points in the first two years after the loss
8257,Anger peaked atabout five months and depression at about six months
8258,Surprisingly even from the start acceptance was rated higher than all other grief reactions
8259,Although this study may notpertain to all types of losses it does give a good sense of the typical grief reaction tothe most common kinds of losses
8260,Poets havewritten about love perhaps as long as poets have been writing
8261,Psychologists may lackthe eloquence of poets but through empirical research we can study the nature oflove systematically
8262,We can observe people in different situations interview themabout their life experiences and develop questionnaires to investigate peoples attitudes and behaviors
8263,This way definitions of love are drawn not only from personalopinion but from scientific investigations
8264,For our purposes we are going to restrict the discussion oflove to an emotional state that one person feels in relationship with another person
8265,It is used to investigate if a single ideais made up of separate subcategories
8266,Researchers create questionnaires based on aseries of items words or scenarios related to love
8267,Participants discussed lovefrom various angles includingmedical humorous erotic andspiritual points of view
8268,Ever since this time wehave wandered the earth searchingfor our other half
8269,Socrates statedthat the love of wisdom and truthwas the highest form of love transcending erotic and romantic love
8270,Socrates felt that love of wisdom and truth was more important that romantic love iStock
8271,Through factor analyses researchers can then identify clusters of items that intercorrelate or group together
8272,Are there different types of love Some researchers suggest that there are many types of love
8273,Others suggest one corefeature to love that cuts across different types of relationships
8274,For example in using factor analysis of  items related to love John Lee categorized six majortypes of love eros erotic desire for an idealized other ludus playful or gamelike lovestorge slowly developing attachment mania obsessive and jealous love agape altruistic love and pragma practical love
8275,In otherwords many items on the scale grouped into this single component of love
8276,In this model all love is composed of three elements intimacy passion and commitment
8277,This includes sexual arousal and physical attraction as well as other kinds of intense emotional experiences
8278,For example parents can feel passionate love toward their children
8279,Commitment involves a decision to commit to loving the other and trying to maintainthat love over time
8280,Using different combinations of these three elements Sternbergdescribed eight different kinds of love nonlove low on all three elements likinghigh on intimacy only infatuated love passion only empty love commitmentonly romantic love intimacy and passion companionate love intimacy and commitment fatuous love passion and commitment and consummate love all threetogether
8281,While this approach may not capture the full complexities of love it doesseem to make intuitive sense
8282,We can speculate that all loverelationships would have high levels of intimacy romantic love would have high levels of passion and familial and longterm romantic relationships would have highlevels of commitment
8283,In fact Sternberg and Gracek found that the intimacy component of love cut across all close relationships with similar ratings for family friendship and romantic relationships
8284,In other words traits thatwe associate with masculine beautyprovide an evolutionary advantage
8285,Masculine beauty advertises to womenthe mans ability to provide physicalprotection as well as to pursue orcompete for food and other resources
8286,Masculine beauty also signals the mans ability to compete with othermen for women
8287,An appreciation ofmale beauty would help womenchoose mates that enhance their ownreproductive success both by ensuring better support in child care andby contributing genes that maximizetheir childrens own reproductive fitness
8288,While we know that culturestrongly affects our notions of masculine beautyfor example with regard to hairstyle fashion and bodily adornmentwe can still conclude that there is a biological basis to basic notions ofmale beauty and that such patterns have evolutionary significance
8289,Physical beauty sends signals to women that a man has an evolutionary and competitive advantage over less healthy andfit males iStock
8290,In other words the best way to pass genesonto the next generation may be different for men than for women
8291,Men can reproducequickly with little cost in time or energy
8292,Women on the other hand put tremendous time and energy into reproduction through pregnancy lactation and childrearing
8293,It is in their interest to mate with fewer men and be more selective in theirchoice of a mate focusing on the resources he can provide for child rearing
8294,Men stressed physical attraction and women stressedhigh status wealth and ambition
8295,In fact homosexual men are more likely toengage in promiscuous sex than heterosexual men presumably because the sexualbehavior of heterosexual men is limited by the preferences of their female partners
8296,People seek out a romantic partner not only for sexual satisfaction butalso for emotional support and fulfillment
8297,In both Busss and Sternberg and Graceksstudies attachmentrelated traits such as kindness and understanding were listed byboth sexes as the most important considerations in romantic relationships
8298,Moreoverthese findings appear to be valid across cultures as Buss collected his data from thirtyseven different cultures
8299,According to Cindy Hazan and Lisa Diamond attachmentbonds between sexual partners otherwise known as romantic love may be just asimportant to evolution as sexual selection
8300,Is romantic love related to parental love The attachment bond between mothers and fathers may have developed out of theevolutionarily older bond between mother and infant
8301,In other wordsromantic love probably evolved out of parental love
8302,Therefore the capacity to seek out and maintain a strong bond with a matei
8303,The experience of falling in love is a widespread one something that most people have experienced at some point in their life
8304,Psychologistsdescribe this emotional state as involving the idealization of the partner and a yearning to spend time with him or her
8305,There is also great sexual desire for the partner andheightened emotional arousal
8306,In their  paper Cindy Hazan and Lisa Diamondspeculated that this mental state serves to keep the lovers focused and preoccupiedwith each other long enough for a more sustainable form of love to develop
8307,Indeed research supports theshort life of infatuation several studiessuggest the average length of romanticinfatuation is about two years
8308,Signs of youthhealth and fertility always form the basisof notions of female beauty
8309,For exampleround breasts and a low waistto hip ratioare universal signs of femininity and fertility
8310,Smooth unwrinkled skin and thelack of gray hair signify youth

8314,Likewise millions of women dye their hair to maintain a youthful appearance
8315,This system is composed of the sex drive attraction  and attachment
8316,The sex drive is associated with sex hormones specifically estrogens and androgens
8317,This euphoric preoccupation with the desired mate is mediated by twokinds of neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine
8318,Dopamine is associated with the reward circuitry and is involved with many kinds of desire
8319,Norepinephrine isinvolved with arousal as well as attention and focus
8320,These hormones known as neuropeptides are evolutionarily ancient chemicals that are involved in a broad range of social behaviors
8321,Oxytocin is released duringnursing and childbirth and is also released in both males and females during sexualintercourse and after orgasm
8322,Fisher speculates that these three systems are relatively independent of each other
8323,Combining these systems in different ways allowshuman beings to engage in a broad repertoire of mating and reproductive strategies
8324,In other words people can highlight sex attachment or infatuation at different timesor with different people
8325,Do views of love vary across cultures We can presume that the components of love proposed by Sternberg can be found inall cultures
8326,Evidence of this comes from many sources including cultural anthropology psychological research and love poetry from across the world
8327,In collectivist cultures like those found in Asia and Africa relationships with family may take priority over relationships withlovers and friends
8328,In individualistic cultures like those of Northern Europe and North America friendships and romantic relationships compete with family for priority and often win
8329,Likewise the concept of duty similar to Sternbergs conceptof commitment is absolutely central to Chinese Confucianism
8330,In contrast judgingby the mountains of romance novels love songs and beauty products found inNorth America it is the passionate side of love that is prized in this culture

8333,Census Bureau fiftysix percent of the populationover age fifteen was married
8334,With the growth of singleparent households singleperson households nonmarried cohabitating couples and samesex couples is it outdated to studythe institution of marriage Although the legal institution of marriage is no longer thesole option for adult relationships it is still extremely widespread
8335,The vast majority ofpeople will be married at some point in their lifetimes with estimates as high as ninety percent
8336,Likewise marriage as an institution is extremely widespread essentially acultural universal
8337,For these reasons marriage merits discussion in its own right
8338,Are there health benefits to marriage In general marriage confers benefits for both emotional and physical health
8339,Unhappily married people report greater emotional distress than single people
8340,Thus it appears that being married has benefits over being single unless one is unhappily married
8341,It is also notclear whether the benefits are solely due to marriage per se or to the benefits of anylongterm committed relationship
8342,Research is very clear that social support is acritical protective factor against emotional and physical stress
8343,Therefore the relationship Handy Psychology     PM  Page qualities that promote intimacy and commitment are most important to a longlast ing marriage
8344,Strong communication the ability to manage conflict constructivelyshared experiences and values and high levels of warmth and affection all contributeto successful marriages
8345,In addition financial stability positive ties to the extendedfamily and positive role models in the families of both partners rather than frequentdivorces and marital acrimony are associated with longterm marriages
8346,Further overly hasty marriages such as those that take place within six months after meeting are less likely tosucceed
8347,Additionally insecure financial status distant or acrimonious relationshipswith the extended family and the absence of positive marital examples in the extendedfamily are associated with poor marital outcome
8348,As described in a  paper by JohnGottman marital failure can also be predicted by the quality of the interactionsbetween a couple
8349,Partners should not expect to share all interests values or attitudes butit is helpful to have considerable overlap
8350,While it is not necessary andcan even be destructive to hash out every little bump in the marital path it is criticalthat recurrent problems or personally meaningful issues be discussed directly
8351,Additionally inadequatecommunication can lead to emotional distance as partners can grow apart

8354,Marriage constitutes one of the most intimate and longlasting relationships in ones entire life spouses lives are profoundly intertwined
8355,Therefore it is inescapable that there will be a degree of conflict
8356,Whilesome conflict is entirely expectable if the marriage is dominated by conflict maritalsatisfaction will suffer
8357,Healthy conflict managementenhances the marital bond but destructive modes of dealing with conflict can severelydamage the marriage
8358,Are there good and bad ways to fight in a marriage There are definitely good and bad ways to fight or argue in a marriage
8359,In generalpeople should address their concerns directly keep their focus on the specific behaviors or circumstances that cause the problem clearly state emotions needs andthoughts acknowledge responsibility for ones own contribution to the problem andencourage the other person to express his or her viewpoint
8360,Ineffective strategiesinclude blaming stonewalling emotional explosiveness namecalling defensivenessand resurrection of every complaint since the beginning of the relationship
8361,While no one can be perfectly mature at all times and it is expectable that every one will regress to immature behavior occasionally it is vitally important to cultivate constructive conflict management skills
8362,By tiptoeing around the difficult issues couples introduce distance into their relationship
8363,In so doing theydeprive their relationship of the shared experience and mutual knowledge that providethe emotional foundation of marriage
8364,A healthy mutually satisfying sex life can enhance intimacy and passion and provide an important buffer against theinevitable strains and stresses of marriage
8365,An unsatisfying sex life can both cause difficulties in a marriage and be a symptom of relationship problems
8366,In tradi tional sex roles the man is the provider and the head of the household
8367,It is hisresponsibility to financially support his family and to protect them from danger
8368,He isthe final authority in the family his wife is ultimately subordinate to him
8369,In more egalitarian marriages neitherpaid work nor household responsibilities are exclusively the domain of one partner orthe other
8370,Partners have equal power and authority in the family and neither partneris subordinate to the other
8371,With the dramatic social changes that have occurred sincethe s sex roles in Western society have become considerably more egalitarian
8372,Tosome extent these social changes have even impacted nonWestern industrial societies such as India and Japan
8373,Divorced rates peaked in the s and leveled off by the s
8374,It islikely this peak in marital turmoil had more to do with the disruptions in sex roles andto couples difficulty adjusting to changing expectations than with the specific natureof the new sex roles
8375,As both men and women become accustomed to womens greaterparticipation in the workforce and their greater autonomy it seems marriages havebecome more stable
8376,Nonetheless greater individualism in general tends to lead tohigher divorce rates as people prioritize their personal satisfaction ahead of familyties
8377,On the other hand several studies have found that greater equality in sex rolescorrelated with higher marital satisfaction even in fairly traditional cultures
8378,CensusBureau an estimated  percent of thepopulation over age fifteen had nevermarried  percent were currently married  percent were widowed and  percent divorced
8379,In  an estimated percent of the population had never married  percent were married  percentwidowed and  percent divorced
8380,Has the age of marrying changed over time in the United States According to the U
8381,Census Bureau people are marrying approximately five yearslater now than they did in the midtwentieth century
8382,Do approaches to marriage vary across cultures The distinction between collectivist cultures and individualistic cultures is frequentlymade in crosscultural studies
8383,In collectivist cultures found in many Asian countriessuch as Korea India and China an individuals identity is tied to his or her socialgroup
8384,In individualistic countries such as the United States Canada and Australiathe individuals independent identity is prioritized
8385,People from collectivist culturesexpect love to grow as the marriage unfolds over time
8386,Instead people emphasize practical concerns such as income potential parenting ability and compatibility with the extended THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE LOVE MARRIAGE AND THE BABY CARRIAGE The institution of marriage has changed considerably in America over the last couple of generations

8388,Using Sternbergs triangular theory of love Ge Gao measured the role ofintimacy passion and commitment in ninety Chinese and seventyseven Americancouples in a  study
8389,Ratings of passion were higher in American than Chinesecouples but ratings of intimacy and commitment did not differ
8390,People from individualist countries also tend to have fewer children and a higher divorce rate
8391,For much of recorded history women were seen to be vastly different from men and even inferiorweak passive irrationally emotional and intellectually impaired
8392,The feminist movement in thes reacted against these derogatory views shepherding in an emphasis onthe similarities between the genders
8393,nurture research does suggest that men and women are not the same
8394,In Janet Shibley Hyde published a metaanalysis of studies on gender differencesacross several psychological traits
8395,She found that men scored considerablyhigher than women on tests of aggression and mathematical ability and moderately higher on tests of certain spatial abilities
8396,Another way that men and women may differ is in their response to stress
8397,The tend and befriend model was proposed by Shelley Taylor and colleagues in
8398,They suggest that compared to men women are more likely to exhibitnurturing and affiliative behavior in response to stress
8399,This appears to be mediated by the interaction between estrogen and oxytocin
8400,Men on the other handare more likely to exhibit a fight or flight response to stress mediated by thebrain chemicals norepinephrine and epinephrine
8401,The male sex hormone testosterone may also support mens fight or flight responses
8402,While it is reasonable to believe that men and women differ the degree of those differences mightbe strongly influenced by cultural and environmental factors
8403,Luckily nature gives women about forty weeks to prepare for this change
8404,Duringthis time both parents can make the necessary practical arrangements to prepare forthe arrival of the baby
8405,Bothmother and fathertobe must reconfigure their identity from that of their parents child into their childs parent
8406,Furthermore they must gird themselves for the loss of autonomy that inevitably comes with parenthood
8407,After a child is born a parent is nolonger a single unitary person responsible only to himself or herself
8408,From now onevery decision will be made from the vantage point of a responsible parent
8409,The womans body no longerbelongs to one person it now contains two people
8410,Likewise the womans identityexpands from beyond a selfcontained sense of self to a broader more encompassingidentity that incorporates her new child
8411,If we think of the enormous investment oftime energy and resources that parents unthinkingly bestow on their children wehave to be impressed
8412,Parents routinely spend inordinate sums of money make extraordinary sacrifices and at times even give up their lifeall for the sake of their children
8413,Evolutionary biologistssum this up to the evolutionary imperative to pass on ones genes
8414,Consequently old feelings and memories of being parented will inevitably be stimulated
8415,It mayalso happen on an unconscious level with the impact of childhood experiences onlyvisible through fantasies attitudes and expectations about the new baby
8416,If the child THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE LOVE MARRIAGE AND THE BABY CARRIAGEHandy Psychology     PM  Page hood relationship was largely positive expectant parents can gain a new appreciation for the level of work and devotionprovided by their own parents
8417,If the relationship was problematic these difficulties may interfere with thepreparation for parenthood
8418,The expectant parents may have heightened insecurities about their ability to function as aparent exaggerated fears of the babysdemands or of their ability to meet theemotional needs of their baby
8419,Alternatively there may be a constricted abilityto imagine and anticipate the future relationship with the baby at all
8420,Mothers anddaughters in particular come together as new mothers need considerable supportand information during this period
8421,Expectant parents need furniture baby clothes maternity clothing adviceand even help with everyday tasks if the pregnancy becomes physically demanding
8422,Atthis point grandparents often step back into a caretaking or at least supportive role
8423,In some cases this can lead to control battles but frequently the shared devotion tothe new baby enhances the relationship between new parents and their own parents
8424,There is tremendous hormonal upheaval and an obviously dramatic shift in bodily sizeand shape
8425,For some women the bodily changes are sources of pride and excitement
8426,Although womenhave not gained much weight yet there is often considerable discomfort
8427,In the secondtrimester the morning sickness generally resolves and the fetus grows to sufficient sizethat the mother starts to look pregnant
8428,In the third trimester most of the fetal bodily structures are already developed
8429,During thisperiod women suffer the most discomfort from the changes to their bodily size andshape
8430,They lose a good deal of mobility and often have difficulty sleeping
8431,Such emotional upset can be disruptive to the marital relationship astheir partners are most likely to take the brunt of it
8432,In fact the second trimester is known as the most enjoyable part ofpregnancy
8433,The mother is past the physical discomfort and emotional upheaval of thefirst trimester yet still relatively physically nimble
8434,We can speculate that the surges of oxytocin thatoccur during pregnancy help condition the mother to nurture her baby
8435,Research haslinked oxytocin to attachment so we can assume that increased oxytocin release during pregnancy will enhance the motherinfant bond
8436,It may also contribute to theintense preoccupation with the new baby that mothers develop during pregnancy
8437,For manymen this task can be quite challenging as they do not go through the same massivebodily changes that women do
8438,Evidently the sonograms helped the babies feel more real to the fathers
8439,Couvade has beenwitnessed in many different culturesand may have even been recorded byMarco Polo during his world travels
8440,In couvade an expectant father takeson some of the physical symptomsassociated with pregnancy
8441,By exhibitingsome of the physical symptoms ofpregnancy the expectant fathersimultaneously draws closer to his wife demands recognition of his role in thepregnancy process and psychologically prepares himself for the new babys arrival
8442,Some authors suggest there are biological causes for this phenomenon as well aspsychological ones
8443,Indeed there is evidence that during pregnancy men undergohormonal changes that are similar in quality if not quantity with their pregnantpartners
8444,feel intimidated by the enormous responsibility of parenthood anxiously doubting their capacity to handle it
8445,While women generally express such anxiety in terms of their ability to nurture men often focus upon financial concerns
8446,Many men are intensely concerned withtheir capacity to provide financial support for their growing family
8447,Finally an expectant fathers experience of pregnancy may be highly dependent on the state of the relationship with the mother
8448,Several studies note relationships between a fathers maritalsatisfaction and his involvement and satisfaction with pregnancy and child rearing
8449,This suggests that although involvement with their children is a profoundly meaningful experience for most men the fatherchild relationship is highly influenced bythe marital relationship
8450,The motherchild relationship is probably not influenced tosuch a great extent
8451,This highlights a pattern that will hold throughout parenthoodHandy Psychology     PM  Page THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE LOVE MARRIAGE AND THE BABY CARRIAGE both for the marital relationship and the child it is crucial that the focus on the new baby not overshadow the needs of the marriage
8452,Some parents talk about falling in love with their baby
8453,It is not a rational feeling it does not come from choice or deliberation
8454,It is a profoundly powerful experiencethat changes the new parents life
8455,From the perspective of evolutionary theory thisblind parental love makes perfect sense
8456,Ifparents did not feel such intense love for their children they would be hard pressed tomake the sacrifices necessary for their children to survive let alone thrive
8457,Additionally there is a tremendous loss of personal time as an infant demandsnearconstant attention
8458,There are financial changes as well if a working woman stays home to look afterher baby
8459,If she goes back to work child care arrangements must be made
8460,Meals social life laundry andmany other aspects of daily life must now be arranged around child care
8461,Eventuallyparents establish new routines but the transition period can be a time of notable stress
8462,In modern Western society changes in sex roles over thelast several decades have radically changed cultural views about fathers roles in childcare
8463,Although women still do the majority of child care fathers are now expected toassume more childcare responsibilities than their own fathers may have done
8464,Thisshift in roles can lead to some confusion as partners may have differing views andexpectations about a fathers role
8465,A number of studies address that fact that newfathers seem to lack clarity about their role as a parent
8466,Just as the lives of theindividual parents are permanently transformed by the birth of a child the marriage istransformed as well
8467,Parenthood undoubtedly brings the couple closer together theynow share the awesome and profound experience of bringing a new life into the world
8468,Nonetheless the arrival of the new baby brings considerable pressures to the marriage
8469,For one infants are extraordinarily timeconsuming and the demands of aneonate can feel relentless
8470,Secondly it takes several months before infants developregular sleep patterns
8471,The disruption in routine is also difficult on a marriage
8472,Additionalprotective factors include clarity and agreement about each parents role the establishment of routines and protected time to devote to the marriage e
8473,Social support and financial stability also help the marital transition to parenthood
8474,Parents must aim to find the balance between appropriate limit setting and empathicacceptance of the childs developmentallevel

8478,This is unfortunate as parents must tolerate some discomfort in the short runin order to raise wellregulated children
8479,Children without limits feel they have toomuch power in the relationship with their parents and this makes them feel unsafe
8480,Without this necessary skill a child will not be able to function effectively in a social setting
8481,This undermines the development of crucial problemsolving and emotionregulation skills
8482,A childs family may be willing to be indulgent theoutside world is far less likely to be as tolerant of the childs whims
8483,Thus if children arenot raised to adapt to the world outside their family they are headed for a considerableamount of frustration anxiety and interpersonal problems
8484,These problems can easilycontinue into adulthood as the previously indulged child is poorly equipped to negotiatethe inevitable frustrations encountered in the realm of work and adult relationships
8485,The child may develop an antagonistic relationship with authorityresponding to a wide range of authority figures with rebellious opposition or fearfulresentment
8486,Inadulthood this might manifest in a refusal to exercise selfcontrol or in problems withprocrastination
8487,Alternatively overly controlled children can become excessively passive their initiative and autonomy significantly constrained
8488,After observing parents interacting with their preschool children Baumrindidentified three types of interaction acceptance and involvement control meaning theexercise of parental control and autonomy granting allowing children to make theirown decisions
8489,Four different styles of parenting were identified based on these behavioral patterns
8490,Authoritative parents are high on all three types of behaviors balancing parental control and recognition of the childs autonomy
8491,Authoritarian parents are THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE LOVE MARRIAGE AND THE BABY CARRIAGEHandy Psychology     PM  Page high on parental control but low on acceptanceinvolvement and autonomy granting
8492,Permissive parents are low on parental control and high on autonomy granting
8493,They are high on acceptance but not always high on involvement as such parents can beinattentive as well as overindulgent
8494,Uninvolved parents are low on all three types of behavior
8495,Of the four parenting styles authoritative parents produce the best resultswith the most upbeat selfassured and socially and emotionally competent children
8496,Nonphysical forms of discipline such as timeouts are recommended instead
8497,A good deal of research supports the greater effectiveness of nonphysicalforms of discipline
8498,According to the theory of behaviorism intermittent reinforcement makes behavior more resistant to extinction
8499,If the parentultimately gives in to the childs demands the child learns that no does not meanno and that parents can be manipulated
8500,Physical affection plays a critical role in child development shaping the growing childsability to tolerate intimacy and physical touch
8501,In other words they workto turn specific genes off and on

8509,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE LOVE MARRIAGE AND THE BABY CARRIAGE ticularly affecting the flexibility of the stress response and capacity for positive emo tions
8510,The classic work of Rene Spitz illustrates the tragic effects of emotional deprivation
8511,Although they were kept warm clean and well fed these babieswere left with essentially no affection touch or personal attention
8512,This gross deprivaHandy Psychology     PM  Page tion profoundly stunted and distorted the infants cognitive motoric and physical development
8513,Children have to learn to recognize label and regulate their own emotions
8514,Unlike the ability to walk or speak this is not a skill that children will learn ontheir own with little effort on the parents part
8515,Thus the sensitivity of the parents to achilds experience and expression of emotion has a profound impact on the childsdeveloping emotional competence
8516,The outcomes included the childs emotional regulation peerrelationships school achievement physical health and vagal nerve tonea physiological measure of stress reactivity
8517,As might be expected high levels of emotionalcoaching and scaffoldingpraising and low levels of derogatory parenting were associated with positive outcomes

8519,found in Asia and Africa employ parenting styles thatpromote interdependence respect for authority and behavioral control
8520,found in North America and NorthWestern Europe promote independence less hierarchical relationships and greater freedom of selfexpression
8521,For example Northern Europeancultures have traditionally been more reserved about emotional expression and physical affection than Southern European cultures
8522,Census defines families as groups of people related by birth adoption ormarriage
8523,For example many homosexual couples live together for decades without the benefit of legal recognition
8524,For one thing the percentage of single households hasincreased dramatically
8525,As people are marrying later and divorcing more frequentlypeople are living alone for longer periods of their life
8526,Nonetheless married coupleswith or without children still comprise the most common family structure
8527,Accordingto the  census married couples account for more than half of U
8528,Unmarried partners of boththe same and opposite sex three generational families and single parents with childrenalso make up a large segment of American households
8529,Furthermore blended familiessuch as combinations of previously divorced familiesare also very common

8532,For example in   percent of EuropeanAmerican children percent of AfricanAmerican children  percent of Asian children and  percent ofHispanic children lived with their mother in a singleparent family
8533,The incidence of homosexual parents with children has also risen in recent decades
8534,Nor do theyseem to differ in sexual orientation with the vast majority developing heterosexualorientations
8535,Modern industrialized and Western cultures favor the nuclearfamily over the extended family
8536,Young married couples move away from their parentsto start their own new family in a separate home
8537,In many traditional cultures theboundaries between the extended family and the nuclear family are much more diffuse
8538,Multiple generations often live together in a single household and grandparentsuncles and aunts play influential roles in the couples marriage and in the rearing oftheir children
8539,Coming of age in the s and s family therapy broke away fromthe discipline of individual therapy to form its own theories and general philosophicaloutlook
8540,The core idea influenced by the seminal work of the biologist Ludwig vonBertolanffy was that families should be looked at as systems and not as a static collection of isolated parts
8541,Census tell us about household arrangements in America According to the  U

8544,American Households in the  Census Household Type  of Households Single
8545,mother father children the nature of the family isdetermined by the interactions between family members
8546,The pattern of interactionsamong family members creates the structure of the family system
8547,Families are also composed of subsystems such as the siblings or the parents
8548,Because the family is asystem the members cannot be seen in isolation
8549,If you change one part you changethe other parts as well
8550,Moreover activity in one part of the system may reflect dynamics in the rest of the system
8551,For example children may act out at school to force theirestranged parents to unite to discipline them
8552,He developed aschool of family therapy called structural family therapy
8553,Boundaries refer to the lines between dif ferent family members or subsystems that mark the limits of influence informationand decisionmaking power
8554,For example there needs to be a clear boundary between THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE LOVE MARRIAGE AND THE BABY CARRIAGEHandy Psychology     PM  Page parents and children
8555,Children do not need to know about the sex lives of their parents or the details of their financial situation
8556,Moreover children should not have undueinfluence on their parents marriage
8557,If the boundaries are too rigidthere is no communication or mutual influence across generational or interpersonalboundaries
8558,If the boundaries are too permeable then there is insufficient respect for privacy and differentfamily members inappropriately interfere with each others decisions
8559,Forexample parents should listen to the opinions and the preferences of their childrenbut still make the final decisions
8560,The demands of immature minds excessively influence parental decisions or even the parental marriage
8561,Thisnot only throws the family off kilter because the adults are not in control but it alsoleaves the children feeling insecure and unprotected
8562,While parents should not expect to always get itright they should nonetheless strive to maintain appropriate generational boundaries
8563,In triangulation  a third person is brought into a twoperson relation ship as a means of diffusing tension between the original dyad
8564,For example a parentmay align with a child in an argument against the other parent
8565,Such boundaries refer to the degree of influence time and information given to Handy Psychology     PM  Page people outside the family
8566,For example families with few relationships outside the imme diate family have rigid external boundaries
8567,In a typical nuclear family the marital subsystem has more power than other subsystems
8568,For example the children mightdevelop behavioral problems in response to the marital difficulties of the parents
8569,One important benefit involves a sense of community of belonging to a larger social group
8570,Secondly extended family members can providevery valuable assistance offering practical financial and emotional support
8571,For example many grandmothers babysit while mothers are at work
8572,Extended family members can provide alternative role models andrelationships for children
8573,For example a mother may be loving but also very anxious
8574,Potential drawbacks include conflicts between parents and extended family members
8575,For optimal adjustment family membersmust work out ways to manage conflict and clarify the boundaries around issues suchas decision making privacy and amount of time spent together
8576,Thefamily spends more time together as children are not capable of independent sociallives
8577,The extended family is often more involved at this time as well as parents needconsiderable support with child care
8578,As the children grow older and more independent parents must loosen the reigns
8579,Family members are less exclusively involvedwith each other and more involved with the outside world
8580,Parents depend less onextended family for help in child care
8581,Eventually parents and adult children establish more egalitarian relationships a transformation that can be quite challenging at times
8582,Parents must allow their grownchildren more independence and adult children must take on responsibility for theirown lives
8583,As the grown children start their own families parents become grandparents and the family relationships are reconfigured again
8584,This is adaptive as long as the parent remainssolidly in control and the older child remains in the role of the child and is not recastinto a coparent
8585,Likewise the child should not be cast in the role of substitutespouse responsible to meet the emotional needs of the parent
8586,Handy Psychology     PM  Page There is also likely to be more involvement of extended family members with sin gleparent families
8587,This can be an extremely important source of support for the fam ily but also raises issues about the boundaries of control involvement and decisionmaking power between the parent and the grandparents aunts uncles etc
8588,With the massive social changes of the s and s particularly the womens movement and the sexual revolution the cultural attitude towarddivorce shifted dramatically
8589,The social stigma of divorce more or less disappeared andchildren of divorced parents were no longer marked by shame
8590,In the s the divorcerate shot up peaking in the late s and early s
8591,By  it was predicted that percent of all marriages would end in divorce
8592,While the divorce rate has come downin the past twenty years divorce is still extremely common
8593,percent offortyyearold men and  percent of fortyyearold women had been divorced
8594,This effect appears to be separate from thedeclining marriage rate
8595,In other words we cannot say that there are fewer divorces simply because there are fewer marriages
8596,While the marriage rate for  year olds steadilydeclined across the same period the divorce rate clearly peaked before it declined
8597,Census report couples married before the age of thirty were more likely toget divorced than those married at thirty or older
8598,Other riskfactors for divorce include financial instability distant or acrimonious relationshipswith the extended family and lack of positive marital role models
8599,It is not so much the amount of conflict that puts a marriageat risk
8600,Most importantly divorced parents can no longer live full time with their childrenand coparenting custody and visitation issues are perhaps the most stressful andconflictual issues in a divorce
8601,There are also added financial pressures becauseincomes that supported one household now must support two
8602,People getover the acute grieving process and depression hostility and regret subside

8613,Handy Psychology     PM  Page it is critical to come up with a binding solution to financial and custody disputes
8614,Once a legal solution is in place the rancor generally settles down although somepeople report ongoing hostility around coparenting arrangements
8615,Some divorcedcouples establish friendships after their divorce but this seems to be relatively rare
8616,The most common outcome is a relatively amicable but not overly involved relationship
8617,Not surprisingly couples without children generally have considerably less contact after divorce than those with children
8618,Such ongoing hostility isvery psychologically costly especially for the children
8619,Sometimes continued hostilityleads to disengagement between the noncustodial parent generally the father and thechildren
8620,Increased hostility can also keep the partners overly involved with each other
8621,In fact some researchers believe that ongoing conflict reflects the partners inability toaccept the end of the relationship as if it is better to have negative contact than none atall
8622,In both cases ongoing hostility is harmful for all involved and divorced couplesbenefit by finding ways to reduce hostility and to resolve conflict in healthier ways
8623,Often there are majorchanges in the childs life there may be a move to a new house or a new school
8624,The parents are going through a highly challenging time and it is very difficult to fully shield the children from the parents upsand downs
8625,They found that the childs adjustment was impacted both by therelationship with each parent and by the parents relationship with one another
8626,Forexample both a positive fatherchild relationship and maternal warmth predicted to achilds wellbeing
8627,Moreover the relationship between the parents affected their behavior toward their children
8628,In sum a hostile noncooperativerelationship between divorced parents has a longterm destructive effect on children
8629,In short do not triangulate your child into your battle with your spouse
8630,in front of your child Bribe your child out of competition Spend large amounts of money in an with the other parent attempt to woo children away from the other parent
8631,As there are clear negative effects of divorce forboth adults and children we can conclude that divorce should not be taken lightly
8632,Couples should try to save their marriages they should work on improved conflictresolution and seek out couples therapy if necessary
8633,If parents decide ondivorce it is incumbent on them to proceed through the divorce process in athoughtful and emotionally controlled way
8634,If they do not they cause unnecessaryemotional pain for their children
8635,Sexuality refers to all thoughtsfeelings and behaviors associated with sexual arousal
8636,This includes sexual fantasiessexual orientation the physiology of sexual arousal and actual sexual behavior
8637,Although there were many scholars of sexuality in the nineteenth centurysome of the most famous are Richard vonKrafftEbbing Havelock Ellis and Sigmund Freudmost of these investigators werephysicians and were concerned with illness and pathology
8638,It was not until the middle of the twentieth century that sexology included largescale studies of normal sexuality
8639,Most peoplecredit Alfred Kinsey with pioneering the systematic and empirical study of normal sexuality in the twentieth century
8640,William Masters and Virginia Johnson followed a fewdecades later with a revolutionary emphasis on sex therapy
8641,Their innovation was toapply the principles of behavioral therapy to improve sexual functioning and enjoyment
8642,Current sexologists study normal and atypical patterns of sexual behaviordesire and attractions and address biological psychological relational and societalinfluences on sexual health
8643,Nonetheless sex is an extremely difficult and controversial topic to talk about
8644,Manywould argue that the scientific study of sexuality lags far behind scientific study ofmany other areas of human behavior
8645,We do know that sexuality involves great passion and the relinquishment of everyday normal inhibitions
8646,In the heat of sexual passion people can violate critical social rules and betray important relationships
8647,Probably because of this all societies develop codes to regulate sexual behavior
8648,Breaking social rules about sexual behavior can bringsevere consequences even death in some cultures
8649,It is possible that the evolutionaryimportance of sexuality may contribute to the intense emotional reaction most peoplehave about the topic
8650,In other words people feel so strongly about sexuality because itis so central to our evolutionary survival
8651,Born into a devout Methodist family with a strict repressive father Kinseys quest tobring human sexuality out of the closetand into the open nonjudgmental lightof scientific inquiry was partly fueled byhis own childhood experiences
8652,He originally started his career as an entomologista student of insects
8653,The obsessive attention to detail he put into the cataloging ofmillions of insect specimens carried overinto his work in sexology
8654,The movie Kinsey written and directedby Bill Condon portrayed the dramaticinterplay between the personal and professional life of this influential figure

8657,Some couples canmaintain a close and satisfying relationship with little sexual activity
8658,For many othercouples sexual intimacy is an important part of the relationship and disruptions tosexual life can either cause relationship problems or be a symptom of them
8659,It is alsoimportant to note that sexual activity generally decreases with age particularly in thelast few decades of life
8660,Because of this older couples may place far less emphasis onsexual intimacy than do younger couples
8661,As the elderly population increases andmore people stay physically and mentally vigorous late into their life it is likely thatthe topic of geriatric sexuality will gain more attention
8662,Do men and women differ with regard to sexuality In William Masters and Virginia Johnsons pioneering work on human sexuality in thes and s it was assumed that the sexual response worked the same for both menand women
8663,All people followed the four stages of sexual arousal excitement plateauorgasm and resolution
8664,Compared to women men masturbate moreuse more pornography are more reactive to visual cues and experience sexual desiremore spontaneously
8665,Women on the other hand are less likely to become spontaneouslysexually aroused and their sexual desire is much more reactive to their surrounding circumstances
8666,For example the quality of a womans relationship with a potential sexualpartner greatly affects her feelings of sexual attraction
8667,In this way science supports theclich that women like to be wined and dined and men like sexy outfits
8668,Men he suggested have a fixed biologically determined sexdrive that is relatively insensitive to context
8669,Women on the other hand have a muchmore variable sex drive far more responsive to the surrounding circumstances
8670,Hebased these conclusions on a broad range of empirical findings
8671,According to thisresearch women have greater variation both in the level of sexual activity and choiceof gender over time
8672,Moreover in women sexuality is far more influenced by culturalfactors such as education religion and peer and parental attitudes
8673,These complaints often co occur they are not necessarily separatefrom each other
8674,blood flow to thegenitals and vaginal lubrication may notalways correspond to her subjective senseof sexual arousal
8675,While some physiological response may occur quite easily theconscious sense of sexual excitement ismuch more tied to a womans emotionalstate
8676,Feelings of depression anxiety andemotional distance can dampen sexualdesire while feelings of relaxation andintimacy heighten it
8677,Negative emotionscan be in response to current situationsbut also a result of longterm emotionaldifficulties related to sex
8678,Erectile dysfunction and ejaculatory difficulty generally increase with ageand may relate to the reduced testosterone levels associated with aging
8679,Sexualdesire decreases with age as well although this does not have to be a problem ifboth partners are satisfied with their sexual life
8680,Medical conditions such as heartdisease and diabetes can also interfere with sexual function in men
8681,These conditions become more frequent with age but are also impacted by health behaviorssuch as alcoholism smoking diet and exercise
8682,Emotional factors play a role aswell including depression stress and relationship problems
8683,A range of deepseatedconflicts about sexuality stemming from important childhood relationships canfurther complicate sexual function
8684,Fear of vaginal dryness pain or lack of response can immediately dampen a womans sexualarousal
8685,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE LOVE MARRIAGE AND THE BABY CARRIAGE For many couples sexual intimacy is an important part of the relationship
8686,Disruptions to sexual life can either causerelationship problems or be a symptom of them  iStock
8687,For example you might feel disgust at the thought of eating chicken if you gotsick one time after eating rotten chicken
8688,Conditioning plays a very important role in sexual response for both men and women
8689,Expectations of failure of discomfort or of lack ofresponse can dampen sexual arousal
8690,Likewise positive expectations of pleasure andexcitement can heighten sexual response
8691,Sex therapists work to break the association betweensexual activity and stress performance anxiety or discomfort
8692,They aim to replace suchnegative associations with positive associations of pleasure comfort and intimacy
8693,In women the hormone estrogen affects sexual function promoting vaginal lubrication and elasticity
8694,After menopause estrogen levels drop off dramatically in women causing vaginal dryness and sometimes pain during intercourse
8695,Many people assume that sexual needs andpreferences should not have to be explicitly stated and thus shy away from direct communication
8696,Some women are embarrassed to directly state their desires fearing theywould appear unseemly or critical of their partner
8697,Enhancing sexualcommunication between partners can be a quick and easy way to improve the qualityof a couples sexual life
8698,This is accomplished through a type of chemical called the PDE phosphodiesterase type  inhibitors
8699,Several other drugs of the same class have been developedthat are also effective with erectile dysfunction
8700,Premature ejaculation is treated with the SSRIs a class of antidepressants that work on the serotonin system e
8701,Couples issues are alsoextremely important and can involve emotional distance poor communication unresolved conflict and mutual misunderstandings about each partners sexual needs
8702,In order to help people relax and learn to enjoysexual intimacy it is often useful to forbid them to actually engage in sexual activity
8703,This takes the pressure off removing the problem of performance anxiety or fear ofdiscomfort
8704,Instead couples are instructed to express physical affection in nonsexualways until they are completely relaxed
8705,From there they slowly increase sexual contact moving in very small steps
8706,In this way negative associations are extinguished tobe replaced with positive associations
8707,This technique has been highly successful witha wide range of sexual dysfunctions
8708,For example many aspects of Muslim culture celebrate sensuality but orthodox Islam is adamant about segregation of the sexes and the covering of womens bodiesin public
8709,Likewise in orthodox Judaism a husband is obligated to make love to his wifealthough women must cover their hair in public and unrelated men and women cannotshake hands
8710,Other cultures are restrictive about any aspect of sexuality devaluing it asdecadent and sinful
8711,the early Christian theologian wrote with great disgust about fleshly desire
8712,Likewise Alfred Kinsey  was partiallymotivated to study sexuality in response to the sexually repressive Christianity he experienced in his childhood
8713,In contrast other cultures are far more liberal about sexualexpression
8714,In many ancient cultures sexual acts were incorporated into religious rituals
8715,Phallic processions were often used in the worship of Dionysus the Greek God ofwine
8716,Similar processions have been found in Japan and other countries
8717,Removal of the clitoris greatly reduces awomans capacity for sexual pleasure
8718,Is there an evolutionary function to controlling womens sexuality  The remarkable pervasiveness of attempts to control female sexuality suggests itserves an evolutionary function possibly the protection of paternity
8719,While a mothercan be very confident that her children are her own men can never be  percentpositive of their childrens paternity
8720,Controlling his partners sexual freedomenhances a fathers confidence and that of his relatives in the paternity of the children he is raising
8721,Similar behavior is found in the mateguarding of prairie voles and other animal species
8722,American law generally prevents public exposure of womensbreasts or of either sexs genitals
8723,There is also wide cultural variation in attitudes toward homosexuality
8724,In many cultures homosexuality is considered sinful and morally unacceptable
8725,In other cultures homosexuality is considered a normal rite of passage
8726,Both in ancient Greece and in the Sambia tribe of Papua New Guinea homosexual relations between young boys and older males were considered a normal part of development
8727,In the United States today the subject remainsintensely controversial with some people accepting homosexuality as a normal part of human sexuality and others still finding it religiously and morallyobjectionable
8728,In general attitudes toward sexuality have become dramatically more open relaxed and liberal
8729,Advertisements for the treatment of erectile dysfunctiongrace the pages of weekly magazines and fairly graphic depictions of sexual encounters are easily found on cable television
8730,For people born in the last few decades itmay be hard to appreciate the sea change in cultural mores that this represents
8731,With this work has come much controversy as to the nature stability andeven existence of sexual orientation
8732,It is important to consider someones sexual attractionsand fantasies in addition to their sexual behavior because external constraints havemore direct influence on behavior than on internal psychological processes
8733,Two particularly striking turns of phrase involved the substitution of white meat for chickenbreast and piano limb for piano leg
8734,Handy Psychology     PM  Page because of social expectations although their primary sexual desires and fantasiesinvolve members of the same sex
8735,Is sexual orientation a category or a continuum  There is some controversy in theresearch literature as to whether sexualorientation exists as discrete categoriesor as a continuum
8736,In other words canwe classify people into heterosexualhomosexual or bisexual categories or dopeople vary along a continuum rangingfrom heterosexual to homosexualAlthough there is a fair amount of evidence that people do not fall intoabsolute categories and some capacityfor bisexual feelings thoughts or behavior exists in many people there is otherevidence that most people fall largely onone or the other side of the continuum
8737,In a study of  subjects published in by Steven Gangestad Michael Bailey and Nicholas Martin  percent of men andabout  percent of women scored three or above on the Kinsey scale
8738,About  percentof men and  percent of women scored a  or  on the scale
8739,That left about  percent of the men and  percent of the women to score   exclusively heterosexual
8740,In general men are more likely to fall at the extreme ends of the scale while women are more likely to fall in the middle
8741,The number of people engaging in homosexual behavior is likely much smaller than the number of people experiencing homosexual attraction or fantasies
8742,In a  study by Randall Sell James Wells and David Wypij about  percent of females and between percent to  percent of men across the United States the United Kingdom andFrance reported homosexual behavior in the past five years
8743,About  percent of malesand  percent of females reported homosexual attraction but not behavior since agefifteen
8744,Combining measures of attraction and behavior about  percent of both menand women reported either homosexual attraction or behavior since the age of fifteen
8745,Thisis partly because the issue is very complex and partly because of the political implicationsof the question
8746,There is a fair amount of evidence of a biological basis for homosexualityat least for some people
8747,Three biological models of homosexuality consider prenatal hormones brain anatomy and genetic influences
8748,There is also support for social psychological and situational factors that contribute to homosexual feelings or behaviors
8749,Women with CAH report elevated levels of typically masculine interests and activities and increased frequency of homosexual or bisexual fantasies and behavior
8750,In  Simon LeVay published work suggesting that a certain partof the hypothalamus the region of the brain that controls hormone function may besmaller in homosexual men than in heterosexual men
8751,The geneticcomponent of homosexuality has also been explored largely through twin studies
8752,The correspondence in sexual orientation between identical and fraternal twins givesinformation as to the genetic heritability of sexual orientation
8753,If identical twins aremore similar in their sexual orientation than fraternal twins this suggests thatgenetics play an important role because identical twins share  percent of theirgenes while fraternal twins share only  percent
8754,Genetics may be less important in people with milderhomosexual tendencies
8755,The availability of heterosexual partners also affects the likelihood of homosexual behavior
8756,In rigidlysexsegregated settings such as prison homosexual behavior is quite frequent
8757,So far we have addressed the social influences on sexual behavior  not feelings fantasies or desire
8758,Recent research suggests that for women more than for men sexual attraction often follows feelings of intimacy
8759,In this case sexual desire is influenced by the quality of the relationship
8760,Likewise in some cases painful negativerelationships with members of the opposite sex can turn people away from heterosexuality and toward the same sex
8761,By gender nonconforming behavior Bailey means interests activities toys and even body movements that are associated with the opposite sex e
8762,In that vein a study of childhood home videos supported a relationship between gender nonconforming behavior in childhood andhomosexual tendencies in adulthood
8763,Do men and women differ with regards to sexual orientation An explosion of research into female sexuality supports the notion that sexual orientation in women is different from that in men
8764,Men seem to be more categorical in theirsexual orientation they are more likely to be either heterosexual or homosexual
8765,Women on the other hand tend to be more flexible in their sexual orientation lesscategorically heterosexual or homosexual
8766,Fascinating new studies of the physiological response of men and women to vari ous sexual images adds support to this theory
8767,Meredith Chivers Michael Seto andRay Blanchard measured genital response to different sexual images
8768,While physiological response in men was for the most part oriented toward either adult women or men women responded sexually to a much broader range of images
8769,In fact womenhad a small physiological response to images of bonobo chimps mating
8770,Moreoverthe physical response in women was often at odds with their verbal descriptions
8771,These findings are consistent with the distinction mentioned earlier between the physiological responses in women and their conscious emotional experience
8772,Thesefindings also align with Baumeisters theory that sexuality in men tends to be relatively fixed and unvarying while sexuality in women is more fluid and more responsive tosituational factors
8773,Perhaps because of the medical origins of clinical psychology psychological research has concentrated on healing the sick and reducing suffering
8774,Whileit is hard to argue with those aims this focus has meant that the study of happinessand of positive emotion has been relatively neglected until recently
8775,Surely we would all like more from ourlives than that
8776,Positive emotions can include curiosity joy contentment excitement interest andor pleasure
8777,Most researchers are more interested in the effects of chronic happiness or the ongoing propensity to experience positive mood than in the immediate effects of a momentary happy feeling
8778,Our needs are being met we have adequate resources and we are reaching our  THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE MOTIVATION AND THESEARCH FOR HAPP INESSHandy Psychology     PM  Page goals
8779,Positive emotional states also encourage people to engage with the environ ment to seek out and take on new goals
8780,We can contrast the effects of positive emotions with those of negative emotions such as depression or fear
8781,These emotions signal to the individual that something is not right that the environment is not safe andthat the best course of action is withdrawal and avoidance
8782,In a  study by Ed Diener and colleagues the proportion of time that people felt positive emotions was a better predictor of their evaluation of their overall happiness than theintensity of their positive emotions
8783,In other words happy people tend to feel mildly ormoderately happy most of the time but may not feel intensely happy all that often
8784,There may be physiological indications of positive mood suchas low levels of stress hormones but there are no objective measures of happiness per se
8785,Nonetheless selfreports ofhappiness have yielded meaningful data in a large body of research
8786,The second type of rating allows researchers toconnect emotional reactions to the specific activities people are engaging in at the time
8787,In  Sonja Lyubomirsky Laura King and Ed Diener published a metaanalysis on research looking at the relationship between positive mood and life functioning
8788,These traits inturn are related to a wealth of positive outcomes including increased popularity socialengagement prosocial helpful behavior coping skills and even physical health
8789,For example in a recent study of five thousand people high levelsof positive mood predicted to fewer hospitalizations five years later and a lower incidence of stroke six years later
8790,In other words happy people are more likely to get married have successful marriagesand even have more friends
8791,Similar results have been found with German and American samples
8792,Over a sixyear period people with higher levels of happiness earlier in the study were more likely to have a happy marriage later in the study
8793,Thus at any given time people with high levels of positivemood tend to have better jobs higher income and more autonomous and meaningfulwork than less happy people
8794,For example if we want tolook at the effect of happiness on coping skills we can perform a metaanalysison all the available studies on this topic in order to determine the overall effect size of this relationship
8795,Metaanalyses give us much more robust and reliable information than data from individual studies
8796,Handy Psychology     PM  Page effects of working at an unpleasant job at some point in their lives
8797,In fact the effect wasparticularly pronounced with students from higherincome families
8798,Presumably thesestudents had fewer barriers to occupational success than students from lowerincomefamilies
8799,The earlier happinessresearchers were quite pessimistic about the degree of control we have over our ownhappiness assuming that we can do little to affect our happiness in any sustainableway
8800,In this view our general level of happiness is genetically deter mined and largely untouched by life events
8801,While significant life events may knock usabove or below our set point the effect is only temporary and we return to our baselinein relatively short order
8802,Although most happiness researchers have since temperedthis extreme stance a fair amount of evidence suggests there is some merit to this idea
8803,Secondlyexternal conditions often have little to do with happiness levels
8804,The findings from this studyhave been used to justify the idea ofthe happiness set point
8805,The authors found that lottery winners were onlyslightly and not statistically significantly happier than their neighborsand that paralyzed accident victimswere only modestly less happy thantheir neighbors
8806,On a  scale of happiness lottery winners scored an average of
8807,All three groups be  lieved they would be equally happy inthe future but compared to the othertwo groups accident victims believedthey had been happier in the past
8808,Does sudden good fortune like winning the lottery make us happier One important study concluded not by muchiStock
8809,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE MOTIVATION AND THE SEARCH FOR HAPPINESS faction over time despite an initial drop in happiness ratings
8810,If we are destined to return to our happiness set point over time then positive lifeevents can only give us a temporary lift
8811,In their view external events doaffect our overall sense of wellbeingwe are not immune to our environment
8812,Nevertheless over time we do tend to adapt to our circumstances both good and bad
8813,More specifically researchers have studied the contributions of genetics demographic characteristics interpersonal relationships moneyattitude toward life and sense of control
8814,Most geneticstudies use samples that do not vary dramatically in their environment or life circumstances
8815,We may be perfectly happy with our cute little cottage as long as our neighbors and friends livein similar houses
8816,The term social comparisonrefers to the way we evaluate our own belongings through comparison with ourneighbors belongings
8817,Therefore because most genetic studies do not include samples from a wide range of environments the importance of genetics may be exaggerated
8818,age gender ethnicity matter but not as much as we might expect accounting for to  percent of overall happiness scores
8819,Estimates similar to this have been reportedin other happiness studies
8820,There isalso a large body of literature attesting to the powerful effect of social support on ourresistance to stress and physical illness as well as our general wellbeing
8821,Do our attitudes affect our level of happiness Several lines of research point to the importance of the way we engage with life ineffect our attitude toward life
8822,Lyubormirsky and colleagues suggest that  percentof our overall happiness depends on our active attempts to foster our own happinessthrough our thoughts activities and goals
8823,This viewpoint is echoed by Martin Seligman in his work on positive psychology
8824,Aningenious  study by Wendy Johnson and Robert Krueger sheds some light onthese confusing findings
8825,In their view the objective amount of financial resources is less important than the subjective perception of financial status
8826,In a study of  twin pairs Johnson and Krueger found that peoples perception of their financial circumstancesthat is whether they believed they had enough moneyhad only a modest relationship with their actual income and assets
8827,Likewise their satisfaction with theirlife was far less related to actual prosperity than to perception of prosperity
8828,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE MOTIVATION AND THE SEARCH FOR HAPPINESSHandy Psychology     PM  Page Can meditation benefit your health and emotional well being Awealth of evidence suggests that happiness is mediated by an area of the brain known as the left prefrontal cortex
8829,The prefrontal cortex isthe most anterior or forward part of the frontal cortex see Chapter for more on brain anatomy
8830,Brainimaging studies electroencephalogram EEG studies and evenresearch on the effect of strokes allsupport the role of the left prefrontalcortex in positive emotions
8831,Richard Davidson has conducted a number of investigations in thisarea
8832,In fact out of the twelvefactors studied perceived control over ones life was the single most important factorcontributing to life satisfaction
8833,Unlike previous happiness researchers Seligman is a staunch believer in the ability of each person to improve his or her general emotional wellbeing
8834,Hisearlier seminal work on learned helplessness contributed to the development of cog nitive behavioral therapies for depression
8835,Instead he breaks happiness or the good life into three components positive emotion the pleasant life engagement the engaged life and meaning the meaningful life
8836,Positive emotions about our past include feelings of contentment fulfillment satisfaction serenity and pride
8837,Positive emotions about our future include confidence optimism hope faith and trust
8838,Positive emotions about our present include theability to experience pleasure from immediate experience
8839,This also involves the ability toattend to immediate experience and not be distracted by concerns about the future or past
8840,Interestingly this aspect of the good life appears to be the least important in that ithas the lowest correlations with a persons ratings of life satisfaction
8841,In the engaged life we are not isolatedindividuals floating on a selfimposed island of alienation but rather we are activelyengaged with the world around us
8842,Seligman believes that increasing life engagementinvolves identifying signature strengthsones own particular strengths and interestsand then putting them to use
8843,The particular cause does not matter and might includepolitics religion community service or family
8844,In this way people gain a sense ofbelonging to a larger group cause or institution and they enhance their sense of selfworth and life purpose
8845,The importance of a meaningful life suggests that a lifedevoted to selfcentered aims ultimately provides limited life satisfaction
8846,This is consistent with the notion of the  Seligman believes that giving back to the larger community is an important part of happiness  iStock
8847,Thus if wewant to increase our level of happiness we are better off considering the way we liveour life rather than solely focusing on the pursuit of pleasure
8848,These included creativity curiosity openmindedness love of learning and perspectivefor wisdom and knowledge authenticity bravery persistence and zest for courage kindness love and social intelligence for humanity fairness leadership and teamwork forjustice forgiveness modesty prudence and selfregulation for temperance appreciationof beauty and excellence gratitude hope humor and religiousness for transcendence
8849,The rankings of the character strengths were notablysimilar from country to country with kindness fairness authenticity gratitude andopenmindedness most commonly endorsed most like me

8852,Visitors to the Website were invited to participate in exercises designed to increase their happiness with a warning that some visitors would be assigned to a placebo condition
8853,Placebo conditions are routinely used as a comparison against the active treatmentcondition
8854,Study participants were assigned to perform one of the following exercisesfor one week only
8855,In the placebo condition subjects had to write about early memories each night
8856,All of the conditions including the placebo condition improved happiness scores and reduced depression scores immediately after the exercises were completed
8857,Oneweek after that scores for the placebo condition returned to baseline and stayed therefor the next six months
8858,The effect of you at your best and identifying signaturestrengths also disappeared within one week after the exercises ended
8859,Remarkably the effectsof the three good things and using signature strengths interventions lasted for theentire six months of the study period
8860,Here theyadapted the exercises used in their Webbased study to more intensive forms of psychotherapy
8861,Nineteen students were assigned to two hours per week of group therapy for six weeks while twentyone were assigned to a notreatment control group
8862,Treatment involved a package of six exercises similar to the ones assigned in the earlier Webbased study
8863,In a second study more severely Handy Psychology     PM  Page depressed patients were treated in individual therapy and compared to equally depressed patients in usual treatment psychotherapy with or without medication
8864,The individualtherapy utilized many of the same techniques as the earlier two studies but adapted theinterventions to address the greater severity of depression
8865,Studying happiness across different countries can be very helpful forpublic policy planners allowing them to identify the social and political factors thatpromote wellbeing
8866,The second has todo with the selection of study subjects
8867,The sample from each country should be representative of the entire population
8868,In his World Database of Happiness he has compileddata on happiness studies from countries all over the world into a publicly availableWebsite  There is also data on the correlates ofhappiness
8869,Nonetheless a countryswealth and its happiness ratings are not entirely aligned
8870,Therefore money only THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE MOTIVATION AND THE SEARCH FOR HAPPINESSHandy Psychology     PM  Page accounts for part of the story
8871,According to Veenhovens studies war political instabil ity totalitarian governments and economic chaos pull happiness ratings down
8872,It alsoseems that democracy security gender equality strong social programs political stability and greater political and economic freedom promote happiness in a countryscitizens
8873,The other six countries ranged from the fourteenth happiest country Ireland to thefiftyfifth Hong Kong

8891,If we make mistakes in thesecalculations we eventually recognize them and correct our behavior

8896,This was not due to the cost of living as inflationhad remained quite low
8897,While psychology cannotaccount for the full complexity of economic eventslarger political legislative environmental and cultural factors play a central rolemore and more economists arerecognizing the critical importance of peoples emotional responses to money
8898,It developed as a reaction against the prevailing view of rational eco THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE MOTIVATION AND THE SEARCH FOR HAPPINESSHandy Psychology     PM  Page nomic man
8899,The focus of behavioral economics is the actual psychology of human financial decision making
8900,Some of the scientists involved include Daniel Kahneman Amos Tversky Daniel Ariely Read Montagueand Richard Thaler
8901,There have also been a number of books written by science journalists such as Jonah Lehrer and Jason Zweig
8902,The risk is the loss of money forexample through a bad investment or through spending too much on something oflittle value
8903,The reward is the possibility of making more money or the purchase ofsomething we value
8904,Remember themedian refers to the amount that equally divides the top and bottom half ofthe population

8906,Median Households Amount with Debt of Debt Real Estate Primary Residence Home Mortgage or
8907,Examples of reward include food sex andsocial status examples of risk include danger from predators withinspecies aggression and loss of resources
8908,Our emotionallife evolved as a means for us to quickly andefficiently recognize and respond to cues inthe environment that are relevant to oursurvival
8909,Our core emotionssuch asdesire happiness sadness fear and angerhelp us process information about riskand reward
8910,Because emotions and the partsof the brain that mediate them are relativelyold on an evolutionary scale we share manyof our core emotions with other mammalssuch as primates cats and dogs
8911,In fact the emotional brain is frequently more active than the partsof our brain involved with thought
8912,Our fear motivates usto avoid loss in this case the loss of money
8913,Desire motivates us to pursue rewardsuch as money or the goods that money can buy
8914,For one thingour emotions are geared almost entirely toward the present
8915,Secondly our emo tions are stimulus bound in other words they are highly and sometimes excessivelyresponsive to cues in the environment
8916,In fact it takes considerablemental effort to put longterm consequences ahead of immediate gratification
8917,As expected the bidsmade from credit cards were much higher in fact twice as high as those made withcash
8918,In another study Laurence Ausubel looked at consumer response to two commercial mortgages
8919,percent for sixmonths that was followed by a lifetime rate of  percent
8920,Ausubel found that consumers chose the first mortgage almost three times moreoften than the second mortgage
8921,Hence they chose the mortgage that would savethem money in the short run but cost far more money in the long run
8922,These cues can then influence our appraisal of risk and rewardand sometimes throwus entirely off course
8923,For example Dan Ariely and colleagues held an auction for arange of items
8924,Before people were allowed to bid in the auction they were asked towrite down the last two digits of their social security number
8925,In other words whether the risk or the reward is highlighted drastically affects ourown appraisal of risk and reward
8926,Decisions were strongly influencedby the way that risks and rewards were framed
8927,As we can imagine advertisers are wellaware of this tendency and put it to good use
8928,We are highly attuned tothe intensity of a risk or reward and get emotionally aroused by high value rewards or risks but we do a poor job of balancing the intensity of a consequence with its probability
8929,For example many people are more afraid of a terrorist attack than of hypertension although far more people in the developed Western world will die from heart disease than from a terrorist attack
8930,Consequentlywe tend to avoid a choice that will lose us money in the short run even if it will makeus more money in the long run
8931,It is important to remember that this tendency isstimulus bound
8932,So we are not responding to the actual possibility of loss as much as the cuethat signals the possibility of loss
8933,Because of this manipulation of cues will strongly influence our behavior
8934,The deMartino experiment on the framing effect described above supports our tendency toward loss aversion
8935,A group of physicians wasgiven a scenario involving an outbreak of a lethal disease
8936,In the first condition twooptions were described in terms of the number of people that would live
8937,In option  there was a onethirdchance that  people would be saved and a twothirds chance that no one would besaved
8938,Only  percent of the physicians chose the second riskier strategy
8939,This way you maximize your profit on the sale of thestock
8940,Leaving aside the difficulty of predicting whether a stock is going to increase ordecrease in value this action goes against our basic emotional nature
8941,As detailed inthe section on behaviorism we are primed to repeat behaviors that are rewarded anddiscontinue behaviors that are punished
8942,For one the frontal lobe the area of thebrain that mediates complex thought has a limited amount of processing capability
8943,The complex cognitive capacities that the frontal lobe provides take up a good deal ofenergy and calories and incorporate a large amount of neurocircuitry
8944,In other wordsintellectual analysis of financial information is very expensive
8945,Consequently ourbrain is highly dependent on energyefficient shortcuts that allow us to process a lot ofinformation very quickly
8946,While these shortcuts allow us to function in the real worldthey can also lead us astray
8947,Three cognitive shortcuts that influence our thinkingabout money include chunking sensitivity to context and the zerosum gamebetween our emotions and cognition
8948,In order to expand thecapacity of our memory we group information into larger chunks
8949,This is useful untilwe forget that the larger chunks were originally made up of smaller units
8950,In other words our estimation of the value of an object will varytremendously depending on the situation
8951,The economist Richard Thaler asked peopleif they would go twenty minutes out of their way to save five dollars on either a calculator or a  leather jacket
8952,Sixtyeight percent of people said yes for the calculator but only  percent said yes for the leather jacket
8953,Even though the amount ofmoney was exactly the same the five dollars seemed like it was worth more in the first condition as it was a larger amount relative to the cost of the calculator
8954,In the secondcondition the five dollars seemed like it was worth less because it was smaller relativeto the cost of the leather jacket
8955,Thebrain depends on energy just like a car depends on gas
8956,If too much fuel is going toour prefrontal cortex to support cognition less fuel is available to the parts of thefrontal lobe that inhibit our emotional impulses
8957,Subjects were given two different memory tasks an easy task to remember two digits and a difficult task to rememberseven digits
8958,Remember we can only hold about seven digits in mind at a time
8959,Subjects were then offered their choice of either chocolate cake or a healthy fruit salad
8960,People with the easy task were more likely to take the healthy food while people withthe difficult task were more likely to take the chocolate cake
8961,The authors interpretedthis to mean that energy expended to perform the harder memory task depleted thebrains ability to resist temptation
8962,Consider the amount of money people are willing to spend for highstatus belongings
8963,In effect people THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE MOTIVATION AND THE SEARCH FOR HAPPINESSHandy Psychology     PM  Page are buying social status
8964,Likewise our sense of a fairsalary a reasonable price and the worthof a purchase is often judged according tothe social context
8965,Older brainimaging technologieslike MRI PET and SPECT allowed us to take a snapshot of the brain
8966,By recordingblood flow or glucose uptake we could map a pattern of brain activity at a given pointin time
8967,Now by recording the behavior of magnetized atoms we canwatch brain activity over time
8968,This is criti cally important if we want to investigate brain activity during a sequence of mental processes
8969,Advertisers have long understood the importance of the emotional brain in making purchasing decisions even beforefMRI research
8970,For example a company selling lipstick associatesthe product with a life of beauty youth and glamour eventhough its unrealistic to believe lipstick will provide all thesethings iStock
8971,These divide fairly neatly into areas associated withcognitive or emotional processes
8972,The prefrontal cortex is involved with careful analy sis quantitative reasoning and consideration of future consequences it is the seat ofplanning for the future
8973,Several smaller areas deep within the middle of the brainmediate the emotional aspects of our financial life
8974,The nucleus accumbens  a central point in the dopaminergic reward circuitry is involved with desire and motivation topursue reward
8975,The prefrontal cortex integrates information from the rest ofthe brain creating an overview of our current situation
8976,Not only does the prefrontalcortex create a representation of our self in our environment but it can create repre THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE MOTIVATION AND THE SEARCH FOR HAPPINESS This is a photograph of an MRI brain scan
8977,Arrows point to areas of the brain that are close to those regions involved with our response to money
8978,The prefrontal cortex PFC is involved in our analysis of longterm consequences of financial decisions
8979,Th e amygdala is particularly responsive to fearful cues and the nucleus accumbens is a key player in the reward system mobilizing us topursue rewarding stimuli  iStock
8980,In this way the prefrontal cortex supports our ability to plan set future goals and correct our behavior in pursuit of these goals
8981,The prefrontal cortex is also involved with the precise careful analysis of information such asthe calculation of cost over time
8982,Because the prefrontal cortex can create and hold representations of possible events and not just current events our prefrontal cortex allows us to be more flexiblein our thinking and even to come up with creative new solutions to problems
8983,This isin contrast with the evolutionarily older parts of the brain involved with emotion
8984,These areas are more stimulus dependent more bound to cues in the present
8985,Thefrontal lobe is also involved in inhibiting our emotional reactions it inhibits the limbic system and other parts of the brain that mediate drive and motivation
8986,In otherwords the frontal cortex allows us to regulate emotion and impulse with thought
8987,Although the prefrontal cortex is powerful it isslow and inefficient
8988,Thus we would miss a good deal of information if we were solelydependent on our frontal lobe for reading our environment
8989,In fact without a sense of somethings personal value weare unable to make decisions
8990,For example people with lesions in their orbital frontalcortex cannot make decisions
8991,This is a region that integrates information about ouremotions into our reading of current and future events
8992,Furthermore if we thinkabout a decision too much it distorts our decisions
8993,In a  study by Timothy Wilson and colleagues undergraduate women were given the option to pick one of five posters
8994,Severalweeks later  percent of the second group regretted their decision while none of thefirst group did
8995,Three bottles of winewere poured into five different bottles giving the impression that allfive bottles contained differentwines
8996,The bottles original labelswere removed and replaced withnew price tags
8997,Even though somebottles with different prices actually contained the same wine subjects clearly preferred the mostexpensive wine
8998,Moreover the prefrontal cortex was the area of thebrain that most strongly respondedto the price tag
8999,A balancebetween thought and emotion is necessary for effective decisionmaking
9000,Do we judge wine based on the price tag One study says we do believing that a costlier wine must be better than acheaper wine even if the same wine is put in both bottlesiStock
9001,This suggests that purchasing deci sions are driven more by the balance of pain and desire than by a rational assessmentof our options
9002,In the last decade or so it has received considerable attention because of its central role in a wide range of psychological phenomena
9003,The dopaminergic reward circuitry starts in the ventral tegmentum an area in the midbrain
9004,This par ticular dopamine tract is called the mesolimbic dopaminergic tract meaning it runsthrough the limbic system in the middle of the brain
9005,The reward circuitry responds to reward cues and serves to mobilize the organism to pursue reward
9006,Subjectively we experiencethis kind of mobilization as desire excitement or craving
9007,The reward system is centrally involved in our financial life
9008,For one it responds to the intensity of areward but not the probability
9009,Forexample in an fMRI study by Brian Knutson the nucleus accumbens was twice as activated in response to a promised reward of five dollars as to a reward of one dollar
9010,This lack of discrimination between lowprobability andhighprobability rewards can explain our attraction to lottery tickets
9011,To the extent that our frontal lobedoes process probability information our reward system may overpower it
9012,In fact an unpredicted reward is perhaps three to four times asactivating as a predictable reward
9013,Parkinsons disease is caused by cell death of the dopamine neurons in the basal ganglia
9014,The treatment usually involves medication that increasesthe amount of dopamine in the brain
9015,Consequently we tend to overestimate our ability to predictfuture events from past events
9016,If there is a good run in the stockmarket or in the real estate market people tend to assume this run will continue forever
9017,In truth a streak of good luck can end at any time
9018,Hence we becomeoverconfident at our ability to predict future events
9019,The amygdala is particularly responsive to fearful cues that is cues of danger
9020,This activates physiological stress responses such as rapid heart beat perspiration shallow breath etc
9021,The amygdala is highly responsive to cues of financial loss
9022,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE MOTIVATION AND THE SEARCH FOR HAPPINESSHandy Psychology     PM  Page Cues signaling immediate danger of loss activate the amygdala
9023,Like the nucleus accumbens and the dopaminergic reward system theamygdala is highly attuned to immediate cues but not very good at evaluating themeaning of the cues in the context of current and future circumstances
9024,It communicates information about our internal bodily states to ourcortex
9025,In this way it contributes to experiences of disgust and pain
9026,Our rela tionships with groups pervade almost every aspect of our lives
9027,We are raised in fami lies and educated in schools
9028,Most of us work in a group setting and many of us live infamilies of our own
9029,Moreover we all live in a community belong to one or more ethnic groups and are categorized into a specific gender
9030,Groups shape our daily lifepowerfully influence our identity and selfesteem and even shape our very perceptionof the world around us
9031,Consequently our psychology and the brain that creates ithave evolved to promote our participation in groups
9032,Is a group larger than the sum of its parts The basic assumption of group dynamics is that there are characteristics of the groupthat cannot be reduced to the behavior of individual group members
9033,In other wordsthe group has a personality of its own
9034,Individual group members may come and go but the characteristics of the group continue
9035,This is not to say that groups do not change or thatindividual members do not matter but that groups can develop an enduring identityand character that is independent of individual members
9036,A good deal of research on thestructure and behavior of groups has been performed within a branch of psychologyknown as social psychology
9037,Social psychologists conducted research on groupnorms group identity and on conformity
9038,One of the pioneers of group dynamics wasa social psychologist named Kurt Lewin
9039,Did psychoanalysis have any influence on the study of group dynamics  While social psychologists were interested in the uniformity of groupsthat is theway that group members act in concertsome psychoanalysts became interestedin the interactions among group members
9040,From working in clinical settings these clinicians recognized that group dynamics influenced the ways people relateto each other
9041,Specifically they noticed the ways that group members formedalliances with each other split into different factions and aligned with and thenrebelled against group leaders
9042,Another influential clinician in the group therapy movement is the psychiatrist Irvin Yalom
9043,Group identity is a critical part of a groups wellbeing andmuch of the behavior of a group will serve to promote and maintain group identity
9044,For example specific rituals forms of dress and speech patterns can help distinguishgroup members from nonmembers and thus promote group identity
9045,We see this withteenage cliques religious groups and even military regiments
9046,Our social identity is a function of our group memberships
9047,By identifying with certain groups we state that we share values goals and beliefs withthat group
9048,Moreover our selfesteem is impacted by our status and value within thegroup as well as the groups status in relation to other groups
9049,Likewise people cangain selfesteem by joining a group that values them andor is valued by others
9050,For example within a corporate setting individual group members areexpected to dress and act professionally
9051,They should not wear overly casual clothesengage in illegal behavior drink alcohol or behave in explicitly sexual or violent ways
9052,Note the distinctive costume including black felt or fur hats long black coats and long side curls known as peyos
9053,These outfits mark the boundaries between the ingroup and the outgroup and play a crucia l role in maintaining group identity  Shutterstock
9054,The group in this case the corporation would act immediately to bring the employee back in line
9055,Cohesive groups have a strong group identity and tightly adhere to groupnorms
9056,These include shared goals that haveemotional significance to group members as well as a history of success in reachingthose goals
9057,Effective leaders attend both to thegoals of the group and to the social and emotional needs of the group
9058,Finally opposition to or contrast with an outgroup can also promote group cohesion
9059,In some casesthis can be harmless or even beneficial as with rivalry between sports teams
9060,This can takethe form of racism prejudice or even wars
9061,Beforebeing accepted to the group an initiate must undergo various trials most involvingsome degree of discomfort pain and humiliation
9062,Such rites serve to increase initiates loyalty and obedience to the group and to heighten the boundary between the ingroup and the outgroup
9063,This theory first presented by Leon Festinger in  states that people tend to rationalize away contradictory thoughts
9064,Therefore an initiate might reason if I wentthough all this trouble to join this group I must really want to get in
9065,Are there examples of modern initiation rites Anthropologists have long spoken about initiation rites in premodern societies
9066,Forexample adolescent boys in the Fulani tribe in West Africa engage in whipping battles Handy Psychology     PM  Page with other adolescent boys as a rite of passage into adulthood
9067,Related ordeals for ado lescent males are found across different tribes in New Guinea
9068,Many rites in modernWestern culture may not be recognized as initiation rites per se although they maywell serve that function
9069,For example boot camp in the marines hazing in fraternities and thirtysixhour work shifts for medical residents may function as initiationrites
9070,Initiates must go through painful and often humiliating trials before beingaccepted into an exclusive group
9071,The amygdala is abrain region associated with the fear response
9072,GROUP DYNAMICS AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE Hazing rituals in fraternities can be seen as an example of a modern initiation rite
9073,Although hazing practices have led to lawsuits a nd even deaths on occasion the continuing popularity of this practice speaks to the psychological importance that initiation rite s can have for group identity and cohesion  iStock
9074,Considerthe intense pressure to conform that many adolescents feel regarding their choice ofclothing music interests and even friends
9075,Most adults would consider these decisions to be either minor or personal certainly not a target of intense social pressure
9076,Inother words they work to regain their former state in the face of change
9077,In a pioneering experiment by Muzafer Sherif in  people were exposed to an optical illusion called the autokinetic effect
9078,If you shine a pinprick of light in a completely dark room the dot of light will appear to move
9079,He first testedpeople alone and then in groups of two or three
9080,Subjects were recruited to take part in an experiment of visual judgment
9081,The groupswere asked to match a target line with one of three comparison lines
9082,In factonly one member of the group was an actual subject
9083,The others were part of theexperiment with instructions to unanimously state the wrong answer twothirds of the time
9084,In fact the nave participants did conform to thewrong answer either fully or in part  percent of the time
9085,Handy Psychology     PM  Page ly group members tend to be far more responsive to majority opinions than to minor ity opinions
9086,If the ideas of the majority are not strongly held and do not carry much personal or emotional weight the group will be less closed to new ideas and minorityopinions
9087,Moreover if the minority group is consistent in their positions this hasmore impact than if they are not consistent
9088,Further majority influence seems to bemost powerful in the immediate aftermath of the discussion and in public settings
9089,Asthere is social cost to deviance people tend to conform publicly
9090,They realize that even unpopular opinions can haveconsiderable impact over time
9091,Are all group roles the same Although some uniformity of values behaviors and viewpoints is necessary withingroups group members are not all interchangeable
9092,For example in a work setting every employee has a specific set of tasksand responsibilities
9093,Group roles are also differentiated according to status and inmost groups there is some degree of a status hierarchy
9094,In other words some roleshave more power and prestige than others
9095,A psychoanalyst in the tradition of Melanie Klein  his main point was that the psychology of groups paralleled that of individuals
9096,Like many before him he was struckby the primitive quality of many group processes the regressed and emotionallyuncontrolled behavior that groups sometimes demonstrate
9097,Bion believed that the primitive quality of group psychology corresponded to the most primitive aspects of individual psychology
9098,An immature or more primitive mindthinks only in extremes and in opposites goodbad lovehate
9099,A mature mind canunderstand complexity can see that people are a mix of good and bad
9100,The world existsin shades of gray it is not just black and white
9101,In the same way that individuals can GROUP DYNAMICS AND THE PUBLIC SPHEREHandy Psychology     PM  Page regress to more immature modes of thinking groups too can lose track of shades of gray and jump to extremes
9102,The part of the group thatwants change can split against the part that wants to stay the same
9103,The followers ofone leader split against the followers of a rival
9104,There may be a split between supportersand opponents of a controversial group member
9105,These splits can become very antagonistic and a previously harmonious group can suddenly erupt into civil war
9106,At somepoint just about everybody will encounter these kinds of splits in their everyday lifeperhaps in a work situation a family conflict or even within a religious community
9107,It is important to recognize that these splits reflect a group dynamic and are not simply a product of individual behavior
9108,Leon Festinger suggested that people compare their own positions with their peers and then act to avoid deviating fromthe group norm
9109,Once a fracture has occurred within a group the two new groups are liable topolarize into extreme positions
9110,Prejudice and racism both refer to a negative view of one group of people Handy Psychology     PM  Page based solely on their membership in that group
9111,Rupert Brown defines prejudice as a derogatory attitude negative emotion or discriminatory behavior toward members ofan outgroup because of membership in that outgroup
9112,Racism is a specific form of prejudice involving prejudicial attitudes or behavior toward members of an ethnicgroup
9113,Social psychologists have long been interested in the phenomenon ofprejudice and have contributed much to our understanding of it
9114,The term stereotype as used in social science was first introduced by the journalist Walter Lippman in
9115,Common contemporary stereotypes are that Asians are hardworking and studious Hispanics are macho and that librarians are introverts
9116,We create concepts in order to make sense of the endlesscomplexity we encounter in our environment
9117,This is a necessary part of humanthought allowing us to process information efficiently and quickly
9118,If we did not create categories our entire life would be a buzzing mass of confusion
9119,Social categorization is a critical part of our social life and is evident as early as infancy
9120,Furthermore people tend to minimize differences within groups and to maximize dif ferences between them
9121,Finally people tend to evaluate outgroups more negatively than ingroups
9122,In this way social categories easily lend themselves to stereotypes ingeneral and to negative stereotypes in particular
9123,People frequently do not recognize that they are thinking in a stereotypical way GROUP DYNAMICS AND THE PUBLIC SPHEREHandy Psychology     PM  Page and assume that their views of various outgroups are based on solid information
9124,Likewise stereotypes are often quite persistent even in the face of contradictory information
9125,This occurs because people favor information confirming the stereotype andare more likely to ignore or disregard information contradicting the stereotype
9126,Furthermore stereotypes are often selfserving and help people in powerful in groups rationalize their privileged position relative to less privileged outgroups
9127,Forcenturies women were depicted as emotional and childish and African Americans aslazy and unintelligent
9128,More recently homosexuals have been portrayed as sexuallypredatory and thus a threat to our schools and our military
9129,Such views justify the exclusion of these outgroups from power and privilege
9130,Our tendencyto stereotype can also be shaped by cues in the environment
9131,In fact people have to struggle hard notto see them selves through the eyes of the stereotyper and not to act in the way that they are perceived
9132,People are prejudicedagainst other people because of their membership in a particular group
9133,Understanding the dynamics of intergroup relations can help shed light on social prejudice
9134,Unfortunately there is no one theory that totally accounts for the relationships between different groups
9135,One theory holds that social prejudice stems from frustration caused by deprivation of needed resources
9136,Other research points to the natureof group identity in itself as a contributor to intergroup tension
9137,As soon as people selfidentify as part of one group they tend to think more negatively about other groups
9138,Thedolls were identical except for skincolor some were white and somewere black
9139,As expected the childrenwere all able to distinguish the raceof the dolls
9140,More importantly thechildren tended to prefer the whitedoll over the black doll attributingmore positive characteristics to thewhite doll
9141,This research was used in the Supreme Court case Brown vs
9142,GROUP DYNAMICS AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE Is ingroup chauvinism natural Some capacity for favoritism of ones own group over others appears to be a natural human tendency
9143,In many studies people attribute more positive traits to their owngroup than to other groups
9144,In Marilynn Brewer and Donald Campbell published a survey of thirty tribal groups inEast Africa
9145,Their subjects had been asked to rate their own tribe and other tribes on aseries of traits
9146,Twentyseven of the thirty groups rated their own group more positively than any other group
9147,Ingroup favoritism or chauvinism can also be created in experimental research
9148,In a series of classic studies published in the s and s Muzafer and CarolynSherif and their colleagues recruited a group of twelveyearold boys to attend aHandy Psychology     PM  Page summer camp
9149,Following these games the boys very clearly displayed ingroup chauvinism
9150,They consistently rated their teams performance assuperior to that of the other team
9151,Furthermore  percent of the boys identifiedtheir best friends from within their own group even though prior to group assignment many had best friends in the other group
9152,In some cases the devaluing of theoutgroup started immediately after group assignment even before the competitivegames began
9153,Moreover group chauvinism will kick in and people will start to evaluate theother group in exaggeratedly negative terms while idealizing their own group
9154,As this tension escalates thegroups further polarize taking more extreme positions against each other
9155,The outgroup becomes evil and badly intentioned while the ingroup remains morally decentand justified in their behavior
9156,Do shared goals improve intergroup relations One important way to decrease intergroup prejudice is to introduce shared goals
9157,Failure can raise tensionsagain especially if there is a prior history of conflict or competition between thegroups
9158,It is as if the groups want to blame each other for the failure
9159,Groups grew angry because they felt deprived oftheir basic needs
9160,This aggression was then expressed either toward the perceivedsource of their deprivation or toward a convenient target in other words a scapegoat
9161,Later authors such as Leonard Berkowitz and Ted Robert Gurr revised this theory
9162,Intergroup aggression did not arise so much out of actual deprivation but more from relative deprivation
9163,This notion is consistent with research on the relationship between money and happiness
9164,Further in a  paper by Reeve Vanneman and Thomas Pettigrew a distinction wasmade between collective deprivation and egoistic deprivation
9165,In collective deprivation people feel that their own group is deprived relative to another group
9166,In egoistic deprivation people feel deprived as an individual but not interms of group membership
9167,One example would be the riseof Hitler and Nazism in Germany that followed the devastation of World War I
9168,Germany faced defeat followed by extremely punitive conditions imposed by the Treatyof Versaille this wrecked the German economy and unnecessarily humiliated aonceproud nation
9169,In an attempt to rebuild German pride and group identity Hitlerused the Jews as a scapegoat blaming them for all of Germanys troubles
9170,In another example of scapegoating a  study by Carl Hovland and Robert Sears looked at the relationship between the price of cotton and the number of lynchings of African Americans that took place in the American South between  and
9171,A negative or inverse correlation was found the number of lynchings increasedas the economy declined
9172,Inthis view intergroup contact under positive conditions can reduce social prejudice
9173,The necessary conditions includecooperation toward shared goals equalstatus between groups and the supportof local authorities and cultural norms
9174,In a  reviewStephen Wright and Donald Taylor alsonoted the effectiveness of identificationwith a superordinate group
9175,In otherwords different groups can cometogether as part of one overarchinggroup for example as part of one community or of a common humanity
9176,Do crossgroup friendships reduce social prejudice Positive emotional experiences with members of different groups can also reduce neg ative stereotypes
9177,Having close friends from different groups is especially effective inthis regard
9178,For one it is near impossible tohold onto a simplistic negative stereotype of someone you know well
9179,Secondly aclose relationship promotes identification with the other person and of the groupsthey belong to
9180,This is referred to as including the other in the self a notion introduced by Stephen Wright Arthur Aron and colleagues
9181,Morality is determined both byour reason that is by our cognitive analysis and by our emotional response
9182,Handy Psychology     PM  Page ogy tries to bring a scientific vantage point to the study of morality
9183,It is not the place of science to make moral decisions
9184,Psychology is a science andtherefore does not deal in the realm of value
9185,This information inturn can allow individuals and society to make informed moral decisions
9186,Hopefully this can also helppeople enhance their moral decisionmaking abilities so that they make morethoughtful mature and beneficial moral decisions
9187,If everybody simply acted out of selfinterest with no concerneither for other people or for the wellbeing of the group at large the group wouldquickly dissolve into a freeforall
9188,Human beings have evolved with powerful selfprotective and selfpromoting motivations and drives
9189,A good part of our motivations areentirely selfish our desires angers and fears serve to promote our own individualinterests often at the expense of other people
9190,Sometimes this erupts in horrificexploitation of or even violence against others
9191,On the other hand humans have alsoevolved as social animals
9192,We are powerfully oriented toward social organization andmost of our emotions serve social functions
9193,Along with our selfserving motivationswe have also evolved moral capacities
9194,Some sense that we must balance our owninterest with the interests of others is deeply encoded in our genes
9195,Carol Gilligan protested this narrow focus andemphasized the importance of compassion and caring
9196,More recent psychologistssuch as Steven Pinker emphasize an evolutionary approach to human morality
9197,In a article Pinker noted that some of our most strongly held moral positions maynot have any basis in reasoning or compassion
9198,These scenarios were first described by the psychologist Jonathan Haidt
9199,From research such as this psychologists have concluded that evolution has inscribed in us the tendency to react with emotional disgust or horror at certain classesof situations
9200,Such situations have evolutionary significance and involve behaviors thatover time are destructive to our species
9201,For example the incest taboo is observed inmany animal species and serves to protect variability in the gene pool
9202,An aversion toeating members of our own family and our pets become part of our family has obvious benefits for kinship survival
9203,Across cultures people express disapproval and distress at the thought of harm coming to an innocent person
9204,A respect for authority and the value of fair treatment formembers of the community also appear to be cultural universals
9205,The puritysanctitycategory relates to the emotion of disgust and involves moral judgments about dietarylaws sexual practices urination defecation and other similar issues
9206,One way of understanding this is to assume that different people and different groups vary in the way they rank the five categories
9207,This can explain the intense cultural dividebetween traditional Islamic cultures and Western European cultures over the  controversy regarding a Danish cartoon about the prophet Mohammed
9208,The Islamic side feltit was a moral transgression for the cartoonist to ridicule the Islamic prophet authorityrespect and ingrouployalty while the Europeans felt the cartoonist had a moralright to free expression fairnessreciprocity without fear of violence harmcare
9209,Do political liberals and conservatives differ in the way they understand morality Attitudes toward the five categories of moral concerns may also influence politicalbeliefs
9210,Things we now consider to behorribly immoral were not alwaysseen that way
9211,More recently in fact well into thenineteenth century slavery was notconsidered immoral in the UnitedStates
9212,Moreover behavior once seenas highly immoral is no longer seenthat way by many people
9213,Premaritalsex was seen as highly immoral only afew decades ago and now is widelyconsidered acceptable
9214,Likewisethere is far more tolerance of publicdisagreement with people in authority than there used to be
9215,If we consider these changes in light of JonathanHaidts five moral categories we cansee that within Western society considerations of fairnessreciprocity have grown stronger while considerations ofauthorityrespect and ingrouployalty have lessened
9216,An illustration of the Greek hero Achilles defeating Hector in battle
9217,In ancient times morality was based on concepts ofhonor and killing other people was often seen as anhonorable thing to do
9218,That stands in stark contrast to todayssense of morality  iStock
9219,GROUP DYNAMICS AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE liberals and conservatives were compared with each other liberals valued harmcare and fairnessreciprocity more than conservatives did and conservatives valued authorityrespect ingrouployalty and puritysanctity more than liberals did
9220,These differencesheld even after accounting for the effects of age gender education and income
9221,Earlier theorists of moral development such as Piaget and KohlbergHandy Psychology     PM  Page emphasized the importance of cognitive development in moral maturity
9222,Two specific cognitive skills include the ability to take another persons perspective that is to putyourself in anothers shoes and the ability to recognize abstract rules that can begeneralized across many situations
9223,Certainly the GoldenRule to do unto others as you would have them do unto you assumes that we cantake another persons perspective
9224,Because children have an immature capacity for either abstraction or perspective taking they are not held to the same moral standards as adults
9225,Our ability to feel anotherspain and to imagine our own pain if put in the same situation underlies our concernfor the wellbeing of others
9226,If we have direct personal contact with the people affected by our decisionswe are much more likely to be influenced by empathy and emotion than if we have  If the only way to save five workmen on a trolley track is to divert the trolley onto another track thus killing just one man on that track would you divert the trolley  iStockHandy Psychology     PM  Page less immediate contact with them if the people involved feel more abstract
9227,JoshuaGreene Jonathan Cohen and colleagues asked people to consider the trolley problemand similar scenarios while undergoing fMRI brain imaging
9228,The authors divided theirmoral dilemmas into moralpersonal and moralimpersonal scenarios
9229,pushing the large man in front of the trolley is an example of a moralpersonal scenario
9230,pulling the switch is an example of a moralimpersonal scenario
9231,The medial frontal region is associated with theprocessing of interpersonal relations and possibly empathy
9232,The anterior cingulateis associated with processing conflicting messages from different parts of the brain
9233,The dorsolateral frontal region is involved with rationalthought and analysis
9234,The scenario involves a trolley that is hurtling down the trackout of control after the trolley driver has become unconscious
9235,You can save the workmen by throwing a switch that will divert the trolley onto another track
9236,Willyou throw the switch sacrificing one man to save five others In these circumstances most people say yes
9237,Handy Psychology     PM  Page This suggests that the farther away we are from the human cost of our actions the more our moral decisions are based on cold rational analysis rather than gut emotion
9238,These kind of rational moral decisions are known as utilitarian judgments  and involve a kind of costbenefit analysis
9239,Initially they apply rules in simplistic and rigidways Ooh you said stupid Youre not supposed to say stupid
9240,With time theydevelop a better understanding of the purpose that rules serve
9241,Nonetheless somecapacity to respond to the feelings of others is evident as early as infancy and evenfouryearolds can distinguish between prohibitions that serve a true moral purposesuch as protecting people from harm and those that simply express a preference suchas not sitting on the couch
9242,Influencedby Jean Piaget he developed a large body of research investigating moral reasoning
9243,Like Piaget he was interested in intellectual development in the way that theability to reason changes across development
9244,He wrote up scenarios that involved a moral dilemma and presentedthem to his research subjects
9245,Based on his research Kohlberg divided moral development into three levels pre conventional conventional and postconventional
9246,Each level contains two stages for a total of six stages altogether
9247,The first level preconventional morality  is most commonly found in children under ten
9248,In this level morality is determined by the consequences of the action tothe person performing the behaviorwhether the individual is punished or rewarded
9249,In the second level conventional morality  the morality of a behavior is determined by its effect on social relationships
9250,The third and final level is called postconvention al morality
9251,In this stage the person is interested in abstract concepts of justice and a just society
9252,Kohlberg believed that all children go through the same sequence ofstages in the same order
9253,A fair amount of research supports this view for the first twolevels but the scientific evidence for the third level is much weaker
9254,Although Madoff was a widelyrespected member of his communityand a devoted family man he defrauded friends family colleagues andmany charities of approximately billion
9255,Did Madoff justify his behaviorto himself as he did it We do notknow but we can imagine he mightwell have
9256,Infact the very nature of cognitionmakes it inherently easy to justifybehavior that is clearly against ourmoral code
9257,Emotion slants everythought we have and does so largelyoutside of consciousness
9258,In otherwords emotions bias our interpretation of events we tend to interpretemotionally significant events inways that are consistent with ouremotions
9259,If we want something to be true we often convince ourselves it is true
9260,A disgraced Bernard Madoff is led away by federal agents after being charged with creating a Ponzi scheme to rip off hiscustomers of billions of dollars
9261,She suggested that his emphasis on abstract thought and impersonal lawsreflected a typically masculine bias to favor thought over emotion
9262,Gilligan claimed thatwomen are more likely to emphasize emotions and interpersonal relationships thanmen and therefore more likely to score at stage  the first stage in conventional moralHandy Psychology     PM  Page ity
9263,This did not mean that women were less moral than men only that they made moral judgments in different ways
9264,While Gilligans critique raises importantpoints about Kohlbergs exclusive focus on intellect she also has been criticized foroversimplifying the female style of moral reasoning
9265,Office politics issues of leadership productivity and staff moraleallof these reflect group processes
9266,The field of study that specializes in group dynamicsin the workplace is known as organizational psychology
9267,Although this can refer to any group united in a common purposefor example a religious social or community organization in this context organi zations refer to those groups that unite for the purpose of paid work
9268,Organizationscan be very small like a fiveperson startup company or enormous like an international conglomerate with a workforce of thirty thousand people
9269,Small organizationstend to be more informally organized while larger organizations depend on greaterstandardization of policies and procedures
9270,An example of this would be a cooperative or a Quaker religiouscommunity
9271,In these entirely nonhierarchical organizations decisions are made by consensus only
9272,The decision is not made until the entire organization comes to agreement
9273,This chain continues up the hierarchy until the very top
9274,Because large corporations have been the most frequent consumers of this kind of information mostorganizational psychology research has been conducted in fairly traditional corporateenvironments
9275,Nonetheless the insights of organizational psychology can be fruitfullyapplied to a large array of work environments
9276,Writing in an age of massive industrialization early theorists of organizational structureaimed to replicate the precision of a finely tuned machine
9277,He believed that the methods of empirical science should be adapted to engineer efficiency in the workplace
9278,Another pioneer in this arenawas Max Weber  a renowned German sociologist
9279,While Taylor focused onthe structure of tasks Weber focused on the authority structure
9280,Weber idealized the precision and control of a hierarchically organized bureaucracy
9281,His aim was to standardizeworker behavior and company policies into a completely impersonal rulebound system
9282,Workers were cogs in a wheel their motivation and morale were of little importanceto the functioning of the workplace
9283,In fact Taylor believed that workers had nointrinsic motivation to work
9284,Rather their performance could only be motivated bycarrots specifically pay and sticks negative consequences for undesirable behavior
9285,Likewise Weber emphasized the rational and impersonal nature of bureaucratic rulesas an antidote to irrational emotional impulses
9286,A movement arose in reaction to this dramatically dehumanizing model
9287,The human relations approach recognized that people are motivated by their emotional and social needs as well by monetary rewards
9288,The surprise results of afamous series of experiments known as the Hawthorne studies gave birth to this move ment
9289,A later versionof this approach the neohuman relations school  recognized that managers have to attend both to task performance and to the socialemotional aspects of work life
9290,In this view organizations are seen more like living organisms than likemachines
9291,It is therelationships between the subsystems that make up the structure of the system
9292,Therefore systems theory is particularly focused on relationships among individuals and groups within the work setting
9293,While the classic organizational theories assumedthat all members of the organization shared the same goals systems approaches recognize that different subsystems can have very different interests and agendas
9294,Office politics marksan inescapable and sometimes very difficult part of such daytoday work life
9295,This approach emphasizes the competition for power thatoften goes on within an organization
9296,The experiment was conduct ed from the vantage point of Frederick Winslow Taylors theory of scientific management
9297,They attended to the temperature and level of humidity in the room the hours worked theamount of sleep the workers had their meals and various other variables
9298,After a year or two of this performance greatly improved
9299,This was at first attributed to the experimental manipulations e
9300,The experimenters finally realized that theimprovement in worker performance was due less to changes in task conditionsthan to the human element inherent in the studies
9301,While conducting thesestudies the experimenters continually consulted the workers and paid carefulattention to almost every detail of their work life
9302,There are several avenues to power in the workplaceincluding control over the distribution of rewards and punishments authority professional expertise or the use of personal charm
9303,Because the pursuit of power is sucha potent and frequent motivator there is often competition between different subsystems over access to power or even access to the symbols of power
9304,Of course such competition can occur among smaller units within these subsystemssuch as individuals or coalitions of individuals
9305,Likewise in pursuit of power or in anattempt to maintain power people frequently build alliances and coalitions
9306,Ones network of alliances is a powerful tool within office politics
9307,Does the degree of hierarchy affect the motivation for power  We can speculate that the quest for power is heightened in strongly hierarchical systems
9308,Sometimes groups are largely autonomous functioning with very little active leadership
9309,Sometimes external factors such as organizational structure and culture or larger economic conditions can constrain a leaders impact
9310,Are there certain personality traits that make a better leader Earlier research studied the personality traits that contributed to effective leadership
9311,The taskoriented leader does this by clarifying thegroups goals delineating each workers responsibilities and addressing any barriersto goal completion
9312,A socioemotional leader addresses the overall morale of the groupmembers
9313,This includes consideration of group cohesion and morale the emotionsand needs of individual workers and withingroup relationships
9314,Therefore most organizational psychologists conclude that leaders shouldattend to the demands of the task andto the socioemotional needs of the work group
9315,Not enough structure prevents efficient coordinated efforts toward the groups goals
9316,It can also result in chaos corruption and abuse of power
9317,Too much structure leavesthe organization inflexible and poorly adapted to change or to variability in local conditions
9318,Because of this a parallel underground system can develop outside the rulesof the formal structure
9319,Thus organizations can varyfrom strongly centralized decisionmaking practices to highly participatory decisionmaking practices
9320,They believed that there is no onesizefitsall leadership style but that leadershave to adapt to different situations
9321,They listed seven characteristics that might influence a decision such as the amount of information needed to make the decision thesignificance of the decision employee support for the decision and other relatedissues
9322,They then made a decision tree based on the seven characteristics resulting in possible situations
9323,CII was listed for  of the  situations while CI and GII were appropriate for  out of
9324,Interestingly the most autocratic styles AI and AII were only appropriate for three and five situations respective GROUP DYNAMICS AND THE PUBLIC SPHEREHandy Psychology     PM  Page ly
9325,In sum this work suggests that consultative styles are appropriate for a broader array of circumstances than are autocratic styles
9326,He did not believe that employees had any intrinsic motivation to work rather that people would only work for rewards such as pay or punishments such as fear of being fired
9327,The human relations approach considered theemotional and social needs of employees
9328,Influenced by Abraham Maslows hierarchy of needsvarious theorists came up with multifaceted theories of employees motivational needs
9329,In  Clayton Alderfer proposed a threepart model of worker motivation existenceneeds basic physical needs relatedness needs for social connection and support andgrowth needs for realizing their own potential similar to Maslows selfactualizationneeds
9330,In  Wofford and Srinivasan suggested that worker performance reflectedfour factors competence motivation role perception and the limitations determinedby the setting
9331,A managers job would be to address each issue as it became relevant
9332,Thesubjects were asked about the high points and the low points of their work life
9333,Forhigh points subjects frequently listed moments of accomplishment and recognitionincreased challenge promotion to a higher level of responsibility and increasedautonomy
9334,For low points subjects complained of problems with managerial and policy decisions of the company recognition salary and relations with superiors
9335,Hertzberg interpreted these results to mean that causes of job satisfaction were intrinsic to the job inherent within the work itself while causes of job dissatisfaction were extrinsic due to context
9336,He integrated these insights into his twofactor theory of worker motivation also known as the motivationhygiene theory
9337,Over the years the study was repeated multiple times in different settings
9338,Handy Psychology     PM  Page A consistent finding was that people attributed positive outcomes to intrinsic or internal causes selfcaused and negative outcomes to extrinsic or external causes
9339,In other words we credit ourselves for our successes and blame others for our disappointments

9349,GROUP DYNAMICS AND THE PUBLIC SPHEREHandy Psychology     PM  Page If your behavior is fair and appropriate in time it will be appreciated by all involved even if the employee in question is unhappy in the moment
9350,Undermine group hierarchy  To the extent that a hierarchy is defined in your group it should be followed
9351,Do not undermine a supervisor by granting inappropriate power to his or her sub ordinates
9352,If someone needs to be promoted change the hierarchy formally
9353,The StrongCampbell Interest Inventory is a well known test that aims to match personal interests personality types and occupational choice
9354,This andsimilar tests are used in vocational counseling to help people decide on a career direction
9355,According to their interests people are characterized according to six personalitydimensions realistic investigative artistic social enterprising and conventionalRIASEC
9356,For example mechanics and construction workersscore high on realistic biologists and social scientists score high on investigative andclinical psychologists and high school teachers score high on social
9357,Newer adaptations of this test such as the Campbell Interest and Skill Survey and the Strong Interest Inventory have also been developed
9358,Based on Carl Jungs theory of personality types the MyersBriggs classifies people into one of sixteen personality types depending on their scores on fourdichotomies pairs of opposites
9359,intuition N refers tothe way people gather information Do they focus on concrete facts or do they try toorganize information into patterns The third dimension thinking T vs
9360,feeling F Handy Psychology     PM  Page relates to the way people make decisions Do they focus more on facts and principles or on interpersonal concerns The final dimension judging J vs

9362,ENTJ INFP  ESFJ and have been linked to specific occupations
9363,Although this test makes good intuitive sensethatis it appears to make senseit has been criticized as lacking adequate scientific validation
9364,Despite these criticisms the test remains very popular in many settings
9365,Some of these are external such as opportunity education economic conditions and professional connections
9366,In a  study of  Romanian engineers by Marcela Rodika Luca creativityand selfmanagement were better predictors of success than intelligence
9367,Moreoverintelligence was more closely related to academic than professional success
9368,Ofcourse the sample was already selfselected for a high level of intelligence
9369,Thereforein jobs demanding high intellectual ability after a certain level of intelligence is metadditional intelligence may not add much to the mix
9370,Additionally based on the many studies that highlight the importance of human relationsgood interpersonal skills are clearly important in the workplace
9371,Finally internal locus of control  the tendency to believe one has the power to affect ones situation also contributes to success
9372,In contrast people with an external locus of control tend to be more passive
9373,You do not exist in isolation you are part of a large network that exists to serve the interests of the organization whetherthat be making widgets serving meals or cutting hair
9374,Your behavior affectsother people just as their behavior affects you
9375,This may seem obvious but it is surprisingly easy to forget
9376,GROUP DYNAMICS AND THE PUBLIC SPHEREHandy Psychology     PM  Page  If there is a problem with completing your responsibilities let your supervisor know
9377,Dont hide your deficits out of fear of looking bad
9378,Most supervisors will be willing to work with you if you need extra support or education or if theres a problem in the system that interferes with your job
9379,Address your needs preferences and complaints from the point of view of a member of a system

9385,If you stick to doing your job you will most likely end up all right
9386,From Wilhelm Wundts  studies of perception in the late nineteenth century psychology has moved to the study of thegroup as seen for example in social and organizational psychology
9387,More recentlypsychology has moved into the public sphere conducting studies on the personalitiesof politicians voting behavior and even ballot design
9388,Do politicians have particular personality traits Although there has not been much empirical research into the personality traits ofpoliticians there has certainly been a lot of commentary on this topic from psychoanalysts and other clinicians
9389,The extensive media coverage of the lives of politiciansprovides ample opportunity for clinicians to make inferences about their psychological traits
9390,The information in the media shares many similarities with the kind ofinformation that psychotherapists gain from their patients during the course of treat Handy Psychology     PM  Page ment
9391,Notably the conclusions that dif ferent clinicians draw are quite similar
9392,One of the most common traits that clinicians talk about is that of narcissismmaybe because the most active mediacoverage of politicians follows scandals
9393,In order to compensate for their fragile selfesteem narcissistic people become preoccupied with theirselfimage and intensely sensitive to perceived shame or humiliation
9394,Typical narcissists have a grandiose sense of self withan inflated sense of selfimportance and anelevated need for attention status andrecognition
9395,The Diagnostic and Statisti cal Manual fourth edition DSMIV orDSMIVTR lists nine criteria for the diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder
9396,In order to meet DSMIVTR criteria forNarcissistic Personality Disorder an individual has to display a pervasive sense ofgrandiosity excessive need for attention and lack of empathy across a broad array ofsituations
9397,Five of the following nine criteria need to be met
9398,Belief that he or she is special and only can be understood by other special high status individuals or groups
9399,Sense of entitlementassumption that others should accommodate to the per sons needs and desires
9400,GROUP DYNAMICS AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE A  study suggests that politicians may have a higher level of narcissistic traits than the general population  iStock
9401,Often envious of others or believes others are envious of him or her
9402,Published by Raskin and Hall in  it has become a widely used test of narcissistic traits
9403,In  Robert Emmons divided the total NPI score into four distinctdimensions leadershipauthority superiorityarrogance selfabsorptionselfadmiration and exploitativenessentitlement
9404,Emmons found that the first three subscaleswere correlated with adaptive personality traits such as selfconfidence extraversioninitiative and ambition while the fourth subscale was correlated with measures ofpsychopathology
9405,This study suggests that narcissistic traits can have both positiveand negative implications
9406,Do politicians score higher on the NPI than people in other professions In one of the few studies to empirically investigate narcissistic traits in politiciansRobert Hill and Gregory Yousey administered the NPI to  university faculty fortytwo politicians state legislators from four states ninetynine clergy both protestantministers and Catholic priests and  librarians
9407,Their  study found a statistically significant difference in total scores with politicians scoring higher than theother three professional groups
9408,In terms of the four subscales politicians scored thehighest on the leadershipauthority subscale and clergy scored the lowest on theexploitativenessentitlement subscale
9409,In other words politicians did score higher than the other three groups in total narcissism but the differences seemed mainly due to their high scores on the leadershipauthority scores
9410,Interestingly although the differences did not reach statisticalsignificance politicians also had the highest scores on superiorityarrogance andexploitativenessentitlement subscales and professors had the highest scores on selfabsorptionselfadmiration
9411,Does narcissism create the politician or does politics create the narcissist This is an important question
9412,While there is little to no research investigating thisquestion most clinicians believe that the personality and the job interact with eachother
9413,The traits necessary for success in politics have to be there from the beginning
9414,It takes considerable selfconfidence extraversion and ambition to wage a successfulpolitical campaign
9415,But the experience of political power also has very potent psycho Handy Psychology     PM  Page logical effects
9416,The power and public attention can be intoxicating leading people to feel they are entitled to special treatment and should not be held back by any limits
9417,Clinicians have further comment ed that the need for a managed and massaged public image can make politicians feelunaccountable for their private behavior
9418,Their public persona becomes entirely cutoff from their authentic private selves
9419,All that matters is the image not the actualbeliefs or behavior
9420,In fact the psychiatrist Robert Millman has coined the termacquired situational narcissism  referring to the explosive impact of fame power and celebrity on narcissistic tendencies
9421,Politiciansget in trouble for financial shenanigans abuse of power and sexual indiscretions
9422,Dont they realize they are bound to get caught As discussed above politicians mayhave a higher level of narcissistic traits than is found in the general population andthese traits are only strengthened in the seductive spotlight of elected office
9423,Theperks of power can create a semidelusional sense of entitlement and invincibility
9424,In a television interview on ABC News Edwards attributed his behaviorto narcissistic attitudes that had mushroomed during his very highprofile campaign
9425,In  I made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in away that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
9426,I recognized my mistake and I told my wife that I had a liaison with another woman and I asked forher forgiveness
9427,In the course of several campaigns I started to believe that Iwas special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic

9433,According to the theory of sexual selection  men gain an evolutionary advantage from pursuing multiple mates
9434,In many species males pursue social dominance in order to gain access to a harem of females
9435,In short these alpha males maximize theirevolutionary fitness by seeking out youth variety and quantity in their sexualencounters
9436,While such behavior among humans is certainly not universal neither isit unprecedented or even that unusual
9437,Are celebrities narcissistic in the same way that politicians are In a  study Mark Young and Drew Pinsky administered the Narcissistic Personality Inventory NPI to  celebrities
9438,They found that celebrities scored significantlyhigher on the NPI than both the general population and a comparison group of MBAHandy Psychology     PM  Page GROUP DYNAMICS AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE students
9439,Furtherreality television celebrities produced the highest NPI scores followed by comediansactors and musicians
9440,Interestingly they found no correlation between NPI scoresand years of experience in the entertainment industry
9441,This suggests that the celebrities narcissistic tendencies may have predated their entrance into the industry
9442,Several studies have looked at it from an absorptionaddiction model suggesting that extreme forms of celebrity worship may reflect a kind of addiction
9443,Otherresearch has found that mild forms of celebrity worship are quite common and unrelated to psychopathology while more extreme forms do seem correlated with emotional disturbance
9444,In a  study John Maltby James Houran and Lynn McCutcheon administered the Celebrity Attitudes scale and a personality measure known as the Revised EysenckPersonality Questionnaire to  students and  community residents
9445,They foundmodest but statistically significant associations between different kinds of celebrityworship and different personality traits
9446,In Eysencks scale psychoticism is less about psychosis than about aggression psychopathy and social alienation
9447,If you look at itfrom a classic rationalist view of costs and benefits you can argue that it doesnt makemuch sense to vote
9448,Voting takes time energy and even money if you have to miss aday of work to get to the polling place
9449,And any single person is unlikely to feel thathis or her vote will change the outcome of an election
9450,Nonetheless people do voteand their participation in electoral politics remains critical for the survival of thedemocratic system
9451,Psychologists and their colleagues in other fields have consideredHandy Psychology     PM  Page the possible motivations for voting
9452,Among other factors they have suggested the role of habit social pressure altruism and even genetics
9453,Regular voters or habitual voters aremore likely to have lived in the same house over several election cycles according toWendy Wood John Aldrich and Jacob Montgomery
9454,Does social pressure cause people to vote Researchers have also looked at the impact of social pressure on voting behavior
9455,Notsurprisingly fear of public exposure can motivate people to get to the polling place
9456,Apolitical scientist named Donald Green mailed out letters to about  Michiganhouseholds before the  primary election
9457,One letter simply remindedpeople of their civic duty to vote the second letter reminded the recipients that votingrecords whether or not people voted were publicly available
9458,The third letter included information on recipients previous voting behavior and the fourth letter listed thepast voting behavior of recipients neighbors
9459,It also stated that the recipients ownvoter turnout would be reported in another letter sent out to their community
9460,Does genetics play a role in voting behavior James Fowler and Laura Baker have conducted a series of studies on voting behaviorin families
9461,They found that the party affiliation of adopted children tended to be similar to that of their adopted parents and siblings suggesting that party affiliation wasculturally transmitted
9462,In sum this work suggests that voter turnout is related togenetics while party affiliation is related to environment
9463,Perhapsaltruism is related to a sense of socialcommitment specifically to a sense ofconnection to the social group and a feeling of responsibility for its wellbeing
9464,Additionally we can speculate that altruism may have some genetic componentperhaps accounting for the apparentgenetic influence on voter turnout
9465,Therefore people tend to fall back on shortcuts basing their decisions on personal liking of candidates identification with candidates hot button issues and simple messages that stimulate strong emotional responses
9466,It is important to realize that muchof this emotional information processing can be unconscious
9467,In short many campaigns try to influence voterresponse by shaping voters emotional reactions
9468,One powerful way to do this is GROUP DYNAMICS AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE Voting behavior is certainly not a purely intellectual activity researchers have found that other factors including socialpressure feelings of altruism and even genetics can play arole iStock
9469,Politicians try to create either negative or positive associations with particular issues or candidates
9470,This can be done through careful use of language meticulously designed visual images and intentional use of emotionallysignificant symbols
9471,For example the colors of the American flag grace almost everynational campaign and though it may be a clich politicians are frequently photographed holding babies
9472,These images prod the voter to associate the candidate withpatriotism and support of the family
9473,Through language he aims to attract the listeners attention implant ideasin their memory and stimulate either positive or negative emotional responses
9474,In his book Luntz states that the most effective political rhetoric is characterized byrepetition consistency simple plain language catchy memorable phrases and shortsentences
9475,A politicians words shouldbe pleasant to listen to with a rhythmic flow
9476,While the message should be consistentsome degree of novelty is also important to capture the listeners attention
9477,While Luntz has been criticizedfor promoting style over substance and in effect manipulation over communicationhe states that content is not entirely irrelevant
9478,In a  memo to Republican party membersthat was widely disseminated in the media Luntz listed  phrases that should neverbe said
9479,In support of the power oflanguage Luntz stated that twothirds of Americans wanted to personalize SocialSecurity while only onethird wanted to privatize it

9481,Votes were entered via touch screenor key pad and races were presented either one at a time or all at once
9482,Elderly voters performed best on thecombination of touch screen ballots with races presented one at a time
9483,Additionallyballot design should not favor one candidate over the other
9484,For example in a study by Joanne Miller and John Krosnick name order was found to significantlyaffect voter choice in fortyeight percent of  races in the  Ohio state elections
9485,On average the candidate on the top of the list received
9486,percent more votes thanthe candidates listed further down the ballot
9487,While that may not seem like a largemargin it is enough to win an election
9488,Nonetheless it is difficultto come up with a precise definition of mental illness
9489,In the most recent version ofthe Diagnostic and Statistic Manual DSM a mental disorder is defined as a psychological pattern that causes distress or dysfunction and that is beyond the norms ofthe individuals culture
9490,Even though a mental illness must cause distress or dysfunction to some extent we judge the pathology of behavior by its relationship to cultural norms
9491,This raises the question of whether all abnormal behavior is pathologicaland whether all normal behavior is mentally healthy
9492,Clearly people can engage inunusual behavior that is not pathological
9493,We do not want to diagnose any kind oforiginal or unconventional behavior as mentally ill
9494,Drug abuse violence and anorexia can be very common in certain social groups butall cause distress or dysfunction
9495,A delusion is defined as a fixedfalse belief that is considered abnormal within the persons culture
9496,Nonetheless it is not always easy toseparate a delusion from a belief thathas become acceptable within a certain subculture
9497,For example the author David Icke has very successfully promotedthe idea that the world is run by aconspiracy known as the Illuminatia term dating back to earlier conspiracy theories
9498,Most of the major political and economic figures in the world today includingGeorge W
9499,Bush Hillary Clinton and even the late Princess Diana are actuallyconsidered to be lizard people
9500,There are several different branches of the lizardpeople including the Grays the Adopted Grays the Crinklies the Tall Blondsthe Tall Robots and the Annunaki
9501,Bush is reportedly a member ofthe Annunaki branch of the lizard people
9502,Are these beliefs delusional Most of us would consider these ideas to be false beliefs that are culturally abnormal
9503,Nonetheless David Icke has many followersand his books have sold very well
9504,Within a certain subculture therefore thesebeliefs are not considered abnormal
9505,According to one conspiracy theory prominent politicians and other leaders in the world are actually alien lizard peoplecalled the Illuminati  iStock
9506,With no common language to describe clinical observations there could beno coordination among clinicians researchers or people working in public policy
9507,There would be no way to research the prevalence etiology cause outcome or progression of the illness
9508,Without a grounding of scientific data there would be no wayHandy Psychology     PM  Page ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESS to systematically develop and test treatments
9509,Treatments would be fragmented ad hoc and untested ultimately based on personal opinion instead of scientific fact
9510,The course of an illness refers to its progression over time
9511,DSMIVTR has sixteen general categories with multiple diagnoses in each category
9512,Examples of these categories include eating disorders psychotic disordersimpulse control disorders mood disorders anxiety disorders and mental disordersdue to a general medical condition
9513,DSMIV is the fourth edition of the DSM published in
9514,This edition made minimal changes to the diagnoses but updated the literaturereview in the manual
9515,The DSM system provides a standardized method to diagnosemental illness
9516,Diagnoses are provided on five axes the first axis axis I lists specific clinical syndromessuch as schizophrenia or major depression
9517,The second axis axis II lists personalitydisorders and mental retardation chronic conditions that affect the full range of apersons psychological functioning
9518,The Census Bureau aimed for an accurate estimation of the U
9519,By  there were seven categoriesmania melancholia monomania paresis dementia dipsomania and epilepsy
9520,In the official psychiatric professional associations decided it was time to designtheir own classification system taking the diagnosis of mental illness out of the handsof the government
9521,This system applied mainly to the most severely ill inpatients those living in mental hospitals
9522,After World War II brought back veterans suffering from the psychological aftereffects of war the diagnostic systems were expandHandy Psychology     PM  Page ed to consider the needs of outpatients those living in the community
9523,The first edi tion of the DSM was published in  DSMIII came in  DSMIIIR in  andDSMIV in
9524,Do psychiatric classifications change over time Because human psychology and culture are so complex and so variable it is very hardto come up with a foolproof system for diagnosing mental illness
9525,The first editions ofthe DSM were strongly influenced by prevailing psychological theories and were poorly linked to empirical research
9526,Diagnoses are prototypesthey are only idealsand few patients fit the classification perfectly
9527,In factmany patients do not quite fit into any diagnostic category
9528,Moreover it is also criticalto remember that the classification system applies to a pattern of symptoms
9529,For this reason DSMIVTR only refersto individuals with schizophrenia for example and not schizophrenics
9530,Along with changes to the criteria and classification ofspecific diagnoses some very general changes were also proposed
9531,For one the firstthree axes of the fiveaxis diagnostic system will be collapsed into one axis
9532,In DSMIVaxis I is for clinical syndromes axis II for personality disorders and mental retardation and axis III for medical disorders that might be relevant to the mental condition
9533,In DSMV that will all be coded on one line
9534,Also DSMV puts much more emphasis ondimensional ratings than any previous DSM edition
9535,In other words clinicians will ratepatients in terms of the severity of various clinical traits such as depression anxiety etc and not just categorize them as either having or not having a particular disorder
9536,Diagnostic categories will be retained in DSMV but there will be more room fordimensional ratings
9537,Because the DSMV system has yet to be finalized we will focushere on the diagnostic system of DSMIV and DSMIVTR
9538,In many culturesdepression is less likely to involve conscious feelings of sadness and more likely toinvolve preoccupation with bodily ailments
9539,Likewise the content of schizophrenicdelusions and hallucinations is strongly influenced by cultural themes
9540,Delusions ofbeing the messiah are frequently found in Jerusalem while delusions of being trackedby the CIA are more likely to be found in the United States
9541,In addition some cultureshave developed unique forms of expressing emotional distress
9542,Ataque de Nervios This is commonly found among Latin Americans par ticularly those from the Caribbean
9543,Ataques serve as a means of expressingintense emotional distress often following a disturbing event
9544,Symptomsinclude uncontrollable shouting or crying trance aggressive verbal orphysical behavior trembling or fainting
9545,Bouffee delirante This syndrome is found in West Africa and in Haiti
9546,This may be mostsimilar to the DSM IV diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder
9547,Koro Fear of a Retracting Penis This rather bizarre syndrome is found in South and East Asia including China Thailand and India
9548,The word koro is believed to be of Malaysian origin but the syndrome has several different names across the region including shook yang shook yong and suo yang in China and jinjinia bemar in India
9549,The syndrome is characterized by acute anxiety that the persons genitals including breasts in a womanwill retract into the body and even cause death
9550,Although in the United States such asyndrome would be seen as a bizarre delusion koro would be more accurately diagnosed as a conversion disorder
9551,Importantly they are recognized as illnesses or as dis turbed behavior within their host culture
9552,Most of these syndromes indicate that theindividual is overwhelmed by strong negative emotions
9553,Examples include Attaque denervios from Latin American cultures Koro from Chinese and East Asian culturesand ghost sickness from Native American peoples
9554,Althoughdescriptions of similar clinical presentations date back to the earliest periods of written history the term schizophrenia and the current definition of the disorder arerelatively recent
9555,The Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler  coined theactual term schizophrenia from the Greek words for split mind
9556,According toDSMIV schizophrenia is characterized by two or more of the following symptomsdelusions hallucinations disorganized speech disorganized or catatonic behaviorand negative symptoms
9557,Schizophrenia involves psychiatric symptoms like delusions hallucinations and disorganized behavior
9558,Handy Psychology     PM  Page month and result in significant social or occupational impairment andor reduction in selfcare
9559,Some sign of the disorder must have been present for at least six monthsand the symptoms cannot be due to another condition such as substanceinducedpsychosis or a medical condition
9560,There are a number of different types of psychotic symptoms  Delusions refer to a fixed false belief that is considered abnormal within the persons culture
9561,Bizarre delusions are physically impossible as in the belief that the queen of England is on the planet Mars sending messages to a chip in your brain
9562,A non bizarre delusion is physically possible such as the false belief that a celebrity is in love with you or that you are being bugged by the FBI
9563,Hallucinations refer to a perceptual experience of something that is not really there
9564,Hallucinations can be auditory sense of sound visual sense of sightolfactory sense of smell or tactile sense of touch
9565,Auditory hallucinations arethe most common and often involve one or more voices talking
9566,Disorganized speech and behavior generally reflect disorganized thought a breakdown of the coherent logical flow of thought
9567,All the symptoms mentioned so far refer to positive symptoms or problematic traits that are present
9568,In contrast negative symptoms reflect the absence of healthy traits
9569,Specifically negative symptoms refer to blunted or flat affect or emotion and adulling of motivation initiative energy and cognitive activity
9570,Does the person display a logical andorderly flow of ideas Or are the ideas jumbled only loosely related to each other andultimately impossible to understand There are many kinds of thought disorder  Paucity of ideation refers to the lack of adequate thought content
9571,Other terms refer specifically to the organization of the persons thought and range in severity from mild and fairly normal to entirely incomprehensible
9572,Circumstantial thought is roundabout but eventually gets to the point
9573,If you ask a circumstantial patient a question he or she will go a long way around thepoint but eventually answer the question
9574,With effort you can understand the person but it takes considerable concentration to identify the connections between thedifferent ideas
9575,Flight of Ideas is similar to tangential thought but is also characterized by a highly energized overproduction of thought
9576,Word salad is essentially gibberish with no clear relationship between the words in the sentence
9577,While thought disorder can be present in many psychiatric illnesses severe thought disorder is most characteristic of schizophrenia
9578,Is split personality the same as schizophrenia The popular understanding of psychiatric terminology is often quite different from thetechnical meaning of the terms
9579,Split personality more accurately refers to dissociative identity disorderDID formerly known as multiple personality disorder
9580,While schizophrenia is a diagnosis of psychotic symptoms DID is classified under the category of dissociative disorders
9581,DID generally develops in childhood as a means of coping with extreme traumaticexperiences such as ongoing sexual or physical abuse
9582,People manage the overwhelming emotions occasioned by the trauma by splitting their conscious experience into multiple identities
9583,There may be the cute little girl the responsible young man and therebellious teenager
9584,In contrast people with schizophrenia generally have aconsistent sense of their own identity but have ongoing struggles with psychosis
9585,Is schizophrenia curable  At this point in time schizophrenia is not curable

9596,Unfortunately we have fewer tools to treat the negative symptoms
9597,Many people with schizophrenia canlive in the community enjoy social relationships and even perform volunteer or parttime work
9598,Is all psychosis schizophrenia People can suffer from psychosis without meeting criteria for schizophrenia
9599,People with mood disorders such as majordepressive disorder or bipolar disorder can often present with psychotic symptoms
9600,Inaddition people under severe stress can sometimes experience psychotic symptoms
9601,It is classified as a mood disorder and is characterized by at least one manic episode and typically one or moremajor depressive episodes
9602,The person also displays symptoms of increased activity with much higher levels of energy initiative andimpulsivity than normal
9603,More specifically three or more of the following symptoms must be present or four if the mood is only irritable inflated selfesteem or grandiosity a decreased needfor sleep an increase in amount of talking or pressure to keep talking flight of ideas orracing thoughts distractibility an increase in goaldirected activity and an increase inrisky pleasurable behavior
9604,People in manic episodes frequently engage in reckless andexcessive spending sexual activity or substance abuse
9605,They can also have psychoticsymptoms during manic episodes but the symptoms tend to be moodcongruent consistent with their elevated expansive mood
9606,For example they may have grandiosedelusions that they are going to Washington D
9607,Peoplewith bipolar disorder tend to have a higher baseline than people with schizophrenia
9608,Little known in his own day hiswork currently sells for millions ofdollars
9609,Over the intervening century many people have theorized aboutthe nature of the mental illness thateventually killed him
9610,While we cannever be fully confident of any diagnosis made in the absence of theactual patient van Gogh left a treasure trove of letters mainly writtento or by his devoted brother Theo
9611,From these letters we can identifyseveral major depressive episodeswith psychotic features
9612,Although such symptoms might suggest manic episodes Blumerconcluded that van Gogh suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy greatly exacerbated by his intake of absinthe a popular but highly alcoholic beverage
9613,It is alsopossible that he suffered from both illnesses epilepsy and bipolar disorder
9614,Tragically his sister also suffered from mental illness possibly schizophrenia andwas eventually confined to an asylum
9615,It is well known that the nineteenth century artist Vincent van Gogh suffered from mental illness
9616,The exact nature of hissuffering is still a matter of some debate  iStock
9617,Therefore the term depression covers a very wide range of experiences
9618,At themost mild end of the spectrum are transient feelings of sadness
9619,Longer periods ofsadness following losses or other upsetting events also fall within the normal range ofhuman experience
9620,While feelings of depression following difficult life experiences are still very com mon severe depression is markedly different from these milder and more transienttypes of depression
9621,DSMIV refers to the most severe form of depression as a major depressive episode
9622,To meet criteria for a major depressive episode the individual hasto exhibit at least five of the following symptoms over a twoweek period and thesymptoms have to represent a change from the persons previous state
9623,These symptoms include consistently depressed mood diminished interest in activities significant weight gain or loss not due to dieting increase or decrease in sleep insomniaor hypersomnia physical restlessness or slowing down psychomotor agitation orretardation loss of energy feelings of worthlessness and guilt and thoughts of deathor suicide
9624,Consequently there is a disproportionately higher rate of suicide in these artists
9625,For example the novelistsErnest Hemingway and Virginia Woolf both committed suicide as did the poets AnneSexton and Sylvia Plath
9626,OCD ischaracterized by obsessions that are repetitive senseless and intrusive thoughts thatgenerally increase anxiety andor compulsions that are repetitive senseless behaviorsthat often serve to reduce the anxiety caused by the obsession
9627,Common obsessions Handy Psychology     PM  Page include an unrealistic and excessive fear of danger of contamination or of commit ting hurtful or morally unacceptable actions
9628,Common compulsions include repetitivecleaning checking ordering arranging and hoarding behaviors
9629,Although these symptoms can become debilitatingtruly taking over a persons lifean individual with OCD always retains some degree of insight into the pathologyof their behavior
9630,Autism is categorized by deficits or abnormalbehavior in three areas social interaction communication and range of interests
9631,Their communication skills are also abnormalwith delayed language development improper use of personal pronouns and stereotyped or repetitive use of language Your parents is coming Your parents is coming
9632,For example a person with autism can developan obsessive interest in trains and memorize the entire schedule of a given transit system
9633,Some of these symptoms relate to another characteristic one thatis well researched but not yet captured in the DSM system
9634,People with autism frequently suffer from a deficit in theory of mind
9635,This refers to the ability to understand another persons subjective experience and is a necessaryfirst step in empathy
9636,Because of their impaired theory of mind people with autismcan have a very difficult time making sense of social interaction and often find socialsituations extremely stressful
9637,It is not clear whether Aspergers syndrome is simply a milder form of autismor whether it is a truly separate syndrome
9638,As with autism Aspergers syndrome ischaracterized by deficits in social interaction and a restricted range of interests evident from early childhood
9639,People with relatively mild forms of Aspergers can be verysuccessful generally in fields that focus on logical analysis factual information ormanipulation of objects for example computer programming engineering or mathematics but they may still have difficulty negotiating social situations
9640,We do know that many forms of mental illnesshave a genetic component to them and specific genes related to the production of neu rotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine have been associated with several forms of mental illness
9641,We also know that early childhood environment plays animportant role stable loving environments protect against mental illness and chaotic neglectful and traumatic environments raise the risk of it
9642,We also know that highlevels of stress in both childhood and adulthood contribute to mental illness
9643,Moreover Silberman reported an evenlarger spike in autism and Aspergers diagnoses in Silicon Valley as well as othertechnologyheavy areas
9644,One explanation for this involves the concept of assortative mating first pro posed by the psychologist Simon BaronCohen
9645,People with Aspergers or autismtraits otherwise known as autistic spectrum traits are known to be talented inthe kind of logical and analytic thinking integral to computer science
9646,Likewise anelevated rate of autistic spectrum disorders has been found among the relatives ofprofessionals or students in physics mathematics and engineering
9647,Consequentlythe huge expansion of the technology industry in the s set the stage for muchlarger concentrations of people with autistic spectrum features than had existedpreviously
9648,In this way men and women with similar genes could come togethermarry and have children
9649,Such parents passed their combined genes onto the nextgeneration increasing the concentration of autism spectrum genes
9650,Handy Psychology     PM  Page Particular disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder and acute stress disor der are specifically linked to extremely stressful events
9651,We also know that the physi cal environment plays a role in mental health and mental illness
9652,Environmental toxins substances of abuse and even exposure to substances of abuse in utero can allcontribute to the development of mental illness
9653,In middle of the twentieth century there was an excessiveemphasis on environmental causes
9654,Phrases such as the schizophrenigenic motherand the refrigerator mother put unnecessary blame on mothers for disorders suchas schizophrenia and autism
9655,Starting in the s the pendulum swung back towarda biological and genetic approach in some cases unnecessarily diminishing theimpact of the environment
9656,Now it is widelyunderstood that all psychological processes involve the interaction between geneticsand environment
9657,More specifically different environmental conditions for example degree of maternaltouch can affect whether specific genes are turned on or off
9658,Many organizations servingindividuals with psychiatric conditions compile similar lists as a wayto reduce the stigma associated withmental illness
9659,Note that some ofthese diagnoses are controversial asmany were made after the person inquestion died
9660,King George III British monarch Psychotic Disorder Due to Porphyria
9661,Winston Churchill British prime minister Major Depressive Disorder Many famous people throughout history have suffered from a mental illness or disability
9662,Can any one gene cause mental illness As far as we know the major mental illnesses are not singlegene disorders
9663,Unlike certain medical and neurological disorders for example Huntingtons disease psychiatric disorders cannot be attributed to any one gene
9664,While multiple genes havebeen linked to psychiatric disorders for example neureulin catechol Omethyltransferase and dysbindin genes for schizophrenia these genes are best understoodas risk factors for the disease rather than as definite causes
9665,Not all people with thegene will have the disorder and not all people with the disorder will have the gene
9666,Any one of these vul nerability genes raises the risk of the disorder but not by a large amount
9667,The greaterthe number of vulnerability genes that any given person has the greater the risk ofdeveloping the disorder
9668,Are some psychiatric disorders more genetically based than others Different psychiatric disorders vary as to the relative importance of genetics or environment
9669,The most severe mental illnesses such as schizophrenia bipolar disorder autismand obsessive compulsive disorder are seen to have a strong genetic component withenvironment playing a largely supportive role
9670,Disorders such as posttraumatic stressdisorder dissociative disorders and various personality disorders have a much strongerenvironmental component with genetics playing a more supportive role
9671,This refers to specific patterns of dysfunction in thought emotions and behavior
9672,Sometimes the problem is more widespread and not just restricted to a specific pattern of behavior
9673,In factthe definition of personality per se is not entirely settled
9674,This includes the individuals selfperception as well as theirtypical mode of relating to other people
9675,Personality is largely established by late adolescence or early adulthood
9676,Nonetheless personality is not entirely fixed and there is possibility for change throughout adulthood
9677,It is possible to divide the large literature on personality pathology into three overall approaches categorical dimensional  and schema
9678,The categorical approach suggests that different kinds of personality pathology can be classified into specific categories as isfound in the DSM
9679,The dimensional approach suggests that people vary as to the strengthof various personality traits and that each individual will have a unique profile of highand low scores on measures of these traits
9680,Perhaps the best known dimensionalapproach is the FiveFactor Model as described by Paul Costa and Robert McCrae
9681,In this view our personality is shaped byour expectations of ourselves and other people in relationships
9682,This set of expectations or schemas operates largely out of consciousness and guides our thoughtsemotions and behaviors in meaningful situations
9683,The psychiatrist Robert Cloninger suggested that personality ismade up of both temperament and character
9684,Temperament refers to biologicallybased personality traits that are determined by genetics
9685,Character refers to the partsof personality that are most influenced by the environment
9686,In this way he integratedboth genetic and environmental explanations of personality
9687,Depending on the theoretical orientation such expectations might be termed schemas representations  or internal work ing models
9688,Schemas grow out of early childhood experiences and by adulthood theyare difficult but not impossible to change
9689,For example if a childs mother is lovingempathic and emotionally stable the child will learn that the world is safe understandable and benevolent
9690,Likewise if the child is raised in a rejecting hurtful and neglectful environment this will teach the child a suspicious and pessimistic view of the world
9691,Sucha negative outlook will guide the childs behavior thus eliciting negative and rejectingresponses from others further confirming the childs pessimistic schemas
9692,This general model of personality pathology has received empirical support from a huge range of research and has been integral to the development of many types of psychotherapy
9693,Moreover it only accounts for the learned aspects of personality and not the inborn or biological aspects
9694,In the beginningof psychoanalysis in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the focus waslargely on the battles between drives and defenses between sexual and aggressiveinstincts and the need to inhibit them
9695,With time noted psychoanalysts such as OttoRank Melanie Klein D
9696,Fairbarnexpanded that rather narrow focus to include their patients characteristic ways ofengaging with the world around them
9697,To some degree all of these pioneering psychoanalysts linked the personality traits of their adult patients to their early childhoodrelationships with parents
9698,This approach later became known as object relations andincluded an assumption that early childhood relationships impacted adult personalityby etching a particular picture of the world into the patients mind
9699,Although there is considerable evidence supporting the impact of early childhood relationships on adultpersonality there is also solid evidence that many personality traitssuch as shynessextraversion sensationseeking and even impulse controlare genetically determined
9700,In the early s Robert Cloninger proposed that personality reflected thecombination of both temperament and character
9701,He defined temperament as inborn genetically transmitted traits that influence the way we process information
9702,He proposed three specific traits of temperament harm avoidance novelty seeking and reward dependence
9703,Harm avoidance may be mediated by the neurotransmitter serotonin while nov elty seeking has been associated with both dopamine and norepinephrine
9704,He believed character to involve learned patterns of interacting with the environment reflecting concepts of the world that were in large part formed in earlychildhood
9705,Cloninger proposed three character traits selfdirectedness initiative ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESSHandy Psychology     PM  Page responsibility and personal agency cooperativeness helpfulness prosocial orienta tion and selftranscendance spirituallyinclined able to rise above selfabsorption
9706,His Temperament and Character Inventory TCI is a selfreport questionnaire withseven scales measuring the four temperament and three character dimensions
9707,Genetic studies suggest that many genescode for either behavioral activation or inhibition
9708,In other words many of the genesthat influence personality seem to code for either sensation seeking impulsive andextraverted traits or anxious harm avoidant and introverted traits
9709,Psychiatric disorders such as alcohol abuse borderline and antisocial personality disorder and attention deficit disorder are associated with behavioral activation genes while other disorders or traits such as depression anxiety and introversion are associated withbehavioral inhibition genes
9710,If more monozygotic than dizygotic twins have thesame diagnosis we can assume that the disorder has a genetic component
9711,By usingvery complex statistical analyses on a sample of  Norwegian twins Kendler andcolleagues determined that the ten DSMIV personality disorder diagnoses were about percent attributable to genetics and about  percent due to nongenetic causessuch as the environment
9712,Moreover the authors performed factor analysis to identify common factors that might influence risk for more than one diagnosis
9713,Three genetic factorswere identified in this study an overall negative emotionality factor an impulsivi Handy Psychology     PM  Page typoor behavioral control factor and an inhibitionavoidance factor
9714,In other wordsthe environmental risks appeared to beunique for each personality disorder
9715,The DSM approach topersonality disorders is the official diagnostic system of the mental health field
9716,The DSM system defines a personalitydisorder as an enduring pattern of innerexperience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of the individuals culture is pervasive and inflexible has an onset in adolescence or early adulthood is stable over time and leads to distress or impairment
9717,DSMIVTR lists tenpersonality disorders grouped into Clusters A B and C
9718,Two additional personality diagnoses depressive and passiveaggressive negativis tic are listed in the appendix as awaiting further study
9719,Cluster B disorders including histrionic borderline narcissistic and antisocial personality disorders are seen as impulsive and emotionally erratic
9720,Cluster C disorders include avoidant dependent and obsessivecompulsive personality disorders and are associated with high anxiety
9721,In other words different raters reliably diagnose people in similar ways and the different criteria of each diagnosis strongly correlate with one another
9722,For one the categorical approach does not account for severity
9723,Secondly the diagnoses are not mutually exclusive and people may meet criteria for more than one diagnosis
9724,Thirdly the diagnoses are far from exhaustive and many types of personality pathology are not easily diagnosed in DSMIV
9725,The Five Factor Model of personality has received consid erable attention in the research literature
9726,As presented by Paul Costa and RobertMcCrae the Five Factors include openness to experience conscientiousness extra version agreeableness and neuroticism OCEAN
9727,The labels for these categories have varied slightly across different studies but the OCEAN labels are nowwidely accepted
9728,Even though there is good evidence that these traits are associatedwith clinically relevant outcomes are stable over time and have some genetic component to them it is important to note that they are derived from statistical analyses ofword lists and not from clinical observations
9729,The Five Factor Model has also been criticized because it isdoes not provide an actual theory of personality only a set of empirical findings
9730,Classified as a Cluster B personality disorder it is characterized by highly erratic and tempestuous behavior
9731,To meet criteria for the DSMIV diagnosis the personmust meet at least five of the following criteria frantic efforts to avoid real or imaginedabandonment a pattern of very intense and unstable interpersonal relationships withswings between idealizing and devaluing others identity disturbance reflected in a strikingly unstable sense of self marked impulsivity in at least two areas e
9732,sex substanceabuse binge eating recurrent suicidal behavior gestures or threats or selfmutilatingbehavior such as cutting or burning the self without intent to die chronic feelings ofemptiness poorly regulated anger with inappropriate anger outbursts and transient andstressinduced paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms
9733,Much research haslinked Borderline Personality Disorder with a history of severe trauma such as childhoodsexual abuse although not all people with this disorder report such histories
9734,In order to compensate for their fragile selfesteem narcissistic people become preoccupied with their Handy Psychology     PM  Page selfimage and are intensely sensitive to perceived shame or humiliation
9735,Typical nar cissists have a grandiose sense of self with an inflated sense of selfimportance and anelevated need for attention status and recognition
9736,In order to meet criteria for theDSMIV diagnosis of Narcissistic Personality Disorder an individual must meet five ofthe following nine criteria has a grandiose sense of selfimportance has a preoccupation with fantasies of unlimited success carries a belief that he or she is special andonly can be understood by other special high status individuals or groups need forexcessive admiration displays a sense of entitlementthe assumption that othersshould accommodate to the persons needs and desires is interpersonally exploitativelacks empathy is often envious of others or believes others are envious of him or herand exhibits arrogant haughty attitudes or behaviors
9737,Is it necessarily bad to be narcissistic Some concern with selfesteem social status and accomplishment is a universal partof human psychology
9738,Thus we can see Narcissistic Personality Disorder as an extremepoint on a range of behavior that includes normal human tendencies
9739,In a  study by Robert Emmons several narcissistic traits were correlated withmeasures of adaptive personality traits such as selfconfidence extraversion initiativeand ambition
9740,Thus some degree of narcissism may be adaptive with regard toambition initiative and selfconfidence
9741,They are characterized by callous and exploitive behavior and by a lack of empathy orremorse
9742,In keeping with the often impulsive and reckless behavior associated withthis disorder ASPD is classified as a Cluster B personality disorder
9743,Unsurprisingly people with ASPD are particularly common in prison populations
9744,In general schizotypal personality disorder is characterizedby discomfort with social situations and odd eccentric behavior
9745,The DSMIV diagnosis requires five of the following nine criteria ideas but not delusions of reference odd beliefs or magical thinking e

9756,People with schizotypal personality disorder have an elevated incidence of schizophrenia intheir families and therefore probably share some genetic loading with schizophrenia
9757,If your environment supports your behavior do you still have a  personality disorder By definition a psychiatric disorder in DSMIV needs to cause distress or dysfunctionand must be outside the norms of ones culture
9758,In factthe newspapers are full of reports of outrageous behavior on the part of celebrities andpoliticians
9759,Forone they want to collapse the diagnosis of personality disorders into axis I along with allother psychiatric and even medical disorders

9770,Would Stalin meet DSMIV criteria for Antisocial Personality Disorder It appears that Stalin met at least five DSMIV criteria for Antisocial Personality Disorder
9771,He repeatedly broke the law before he was in powerand after attaining power he simply created the law to suit his needs
9772,He lied andconned others to maintain his position of absolute power

9777,As early as  the World Health Organization discouraged the use of the word addiction in a mental health context stating that the word had become toocolloquial and was not sufficiently precise
9778,Consequently the major diagnostic systems DSM and ICD diagnose substance abuse and dependence rather than addiction
9779,Nonetheless addiction remains a widely used term within the field as well as the pop ular culture
9780,While use of the word addiction generally refers to a chemical substance such as heroin or cocaine people also speak of behavioral addictions such ascompulsive gambling or addiction to sex
9781,In fact a new category of behavioral addictions is being considered for DSMV
9782,Data are based on interviews with  subjects aged  or older
9783,For one recreational use of substances is extremely widespread affectingalmost half the U
9784,Nonetheless use of highly addictive substances suchas heroin and methamphetamine is far less common than use of less addictive substances such as marijuana and pain relievers
9785,Secondly there is a large differencebetween lifetime use and recent use suggesting that recreational drug use is eitherinfrequent or temporary for most people
9786,Is there a difference between recreational drug use and addiction Almost half the U
9787,population uses an illicit substance at some point in their life
9788,Severe addiction particularly to the most addictive substances such as heroin cocaine or methamphetamine lays waste to peoples lives
9789,Furthermore approximately  percent of people with substance dependence commit suicide generally in the midst of a substanceinduced depression
9790,More specifically substance abuse requires recurrent use of the substance resulting in failure to meet major role obligations exposure to situations thatare physically hazardous e
9791,drunk driving recurrent legal problems and continued use despite repeated negative social consequences
9792,In addition to causingsocial occupational andor financial problems substance dependence also requiresa physiological addiction to the drug
9793,Additionally there can be an increase in the amount of substance used over time a persistent desireto cut down or unsuccessful efforts to doso considerable amounts of time spent inpursuit of the substance sacrifice ofimportant life activities because of substance use andor the continued use ofthe substance despite clear physiologicalor psychological damage from it
9794,For example tolerance for amphetamine and opiates is generally stronger than that for alcohol
9795,Consequently people with a history ofopiate abuse or dependence often require much more opiates to treat pain than theaverage person
9796,Because the brain has become adapted to the chemical removal of thechemical sends the brain into a disregulated state
9797,Depending on the substance withdrawal symptoms caninclude changes in heart rate vomiting confusion pain and even seizures
9798,Theeffects of withdrawal are generally opposite to the effects of intoxication
9799,For examplepeople become energetic and euphoric during cocaine intoxication but experiencefatigue and depression during cocaine withdrawal
9800,Are addictions pleasurable Few people suffering from substance dependence would say that addictions are pleasurable
9801,Many addicts will say that the use of the drug was initially pleasurable butthat as the addiction set in the pleasure was counterbalanced by craving
9802,At thispoint they used the drug to reduce the discomfort of craving or withdrawal as muchas to bring pleasure
9803,Drugs such as cocaine amphetamine and nicotine have a direct effect on the dopamine system
9804,Other drugs such as heroin andmarijuana may have an indirect effect on this system
9805,The dopamine neurons originate deep in a region of the midbrain called the ventral tegmental area
9806,These dopamine neurons course through the middle of the brain connecting with a smallstructure in the forebrain known as the nucleus accumbens
9807,In other words this system is central to an animals experience of desire and motivation
9808,Activation of the reward system stimulatespleasurable feelings of euphoria energy and enthusiasm
9809,Many drugs of abuse directlystimulate this chemical system providing an immediate and intensely pleasurableexperience
9810,Over time activating the dopamine reward system by outside chemicals changes the structure of the brain reducing itsability to regulate the dopamine system
9811,Because of the direct effect of substances of abuse on neurotransmitters there is often a dramatic change in neurotransmitter function
9812,For example in response to foreign chemicals that mimic theactivity of neurotransmitters the neurons may decrease production of their own neurotransmitters
9813,This change of the actual structure of theneurons contributes to the addictive process
9814,Drug tolerance the need for moreand more of the same drug to achieve the same psychological effect is also related tothe changes in the neurons structure
9815,Moreover changes to the neurons can lead to areduction in brain volume in other words brain shrinkage
9816,Are some drugs more addictive than others There are at least two ways that drugs can vary in their addictive potential
9817,Drugs with longer halflives havea less quick and intense high and cause less abrupt withdrawal syndromes
9818,The intensity of the dopamine spike that a drug causes also affects itsaddiction potential
9819,Although drugs such as cocaine nicotine and amphetamine allcause an increase in dopamine activity they vary tremendously in terms of thestrength of the spikes they cause
9820,Although its popularity in the UnitedStates is fairly recent it was first developed in the nineteenth century and used by theJapanese and the Germans during World War II
9821,One of the reasons it is so powerfully addictive is that it causes a dopamine spike much stronger than cocaine and vastly larger than nicotine
9822,This spike is ten to times higher than baseline levels and five to ten times higher than the spikes causedby natural rewards such as food or sex
9823,Tragically thisgreatly enhanced release of dopamine damages the dopamine neurons in a processcalled neurotoxicity
9824,Changes in the dopamine neurons takes place within days of useboth within humans and animals and the effects can last for months or years

9829,Drug Abuse or Dependence Drug Abuse or Dependence Dependence Any Type
9830,Is there a genetic basis to addiction A fair amount of research in the past few decades has pointed to a genetic componentto addiction
9831,Specific genes related to the neurotransmitter serotonin have beenlinked to earlyonset alcoholism though it is unclear if this is related to alcoholismper se or to poor behavioral control
9832,In addition Kenneth Kendler and colleagueshave performed twin studies looking at the relative contribution of genes and environment to the abuse of or dependence on six different substances cannabis marijuana cocaine hallucinogens sedatives stimulants and opiates
9833,From their comparisonof  malemale twin pairs the authors concluded that on average each form ofdrug addiction was about  percent attributable to genetics and  percent attributable to environment
9834,ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESSHandy Psychology     PM  Page Moreover there appeared to be a genetic vulnerability to developing drug addic tion in general but not to developing an addiction to any particular drug
9835,Similarly there was a general effect of environment influencing the likelihood of any kind ofdrug abusedependence rather than abuse of a specific drug
9836,Interestingly opiateaddiction seemed more heavily influenced by environment  percent than genetics percent
9837,Perhaps opiates are less available than other drugs and as a result opiate abuse is heavily dependent on exposure to drugs in the environment
9838,In other words adults with addictionreport a higher incidence of childhood trauma and neglect than adults withoutaddiction
9839,In these circumstances drug use can be very attractive because it servesat least at first to reduce negative emotion and enhance positive emotion
9840,In theabsence of effective emotional regulation skills any shortcut to positive emotioncan be very appealing
9841,Moreover people with poor impulse control are less likelyto monitor their drug use
9842,As a result recreational drug use is more likely to escalate into addiction
9843,Drugs and crime are closely linked partly because people often lose their jobs because of their addiction and turn to crime  iStock
9844,As is clear in the chart substance use disorders start inthe early teens peak at age  and then subside after that
9845,The abrupt decline afterage  is consistent with research suggesting many people conquer their substanceproblems without treatment
9846,These data come from the  National Survey on DrugUse and Health for subjects aged  or older conducted by SAMHSA of the U
9847,Classification of substance abuse anddependence is based on DSMIV diagnostic criteria
9848,Population in  Abusing or Dependent on Drugs or Alcohol According to Age Age Illicit Drugs Alcohol Drugs or Alcohol
9849,For onethe addiction may destroy the persons ability to hold a job removing the means to ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESSHandy Psychology     PM  Page pay for the drug
9850,In this situation drug addicts may turn to crime in order to obtain the money needed to pay for their drug
9851,Common forms of criminal activity includerobbery drug dealing and prostitution
9852,In fact it has been estimated that  percent of car accidents and more than percent of murders involve alcohol intoxication
9853,Thirdly most Western countries outlaw the most common drugs of abuse
9854,Unfortunately this fails to erase demand for thedrugs though many argue that it does decrease demand
9855,Consequently the market for illicit drugs goes underground and becomes the domain of criminals
9856,Competitionwithin the illicit drug trade has led to a tremendous amount of violence dating backto the days of Al Capone in the s
9857,People are always aware of their drug useand of their choice to use
9858,Thus we cannot say addicted individuals have no choiceand no control over their drug use
9859,Nonetheless it is important to realize that addiction changes the brain
9860,In the most addictive drugs the cravings are overwhelmingand the ability to inhibit selfdestructive behavior is very weak
9861,This is because theparts of the brain that monitor behavior employ social judgment and inhibit harmfulactions are significantly compromised at the same time that the reward system is onoverdrive
9862,Therefore it is fair to say that addicted individuals have some control overtheir behavior but far far less control than a nonaddicted person
9863,Some addicts havelittle to no motivation to change their behavior
9864,At this point the individual does not believe he or she has a problem and is resistant to suggestions to change
9865,There maybe considerable denial about the extent of the problem
9866,In this stage the individual is aware there is a problem and is beginning to consider taking action to change
9867,The person is now taking steps in preparation of change
9868,Forexample he or she may start researching drug treatment options or talking to familyand friends about the need to stop using the drug
9869,Nonetheless there is still ambivalence about giving up the substance
9870,Handy Psychology     PM  Page The fourth stage is termed action
9871,At this point the person takes actual steps to stop the substance use
9872,This may involve joining a twelvestep group an outpatient treatment center or even getting admitted for inpatient treatment
9873,The person alsorecognizes the need to change a broad array of psychological and social patterns associated with the addiction
9874,In the fifth maintenance phase the person has successfully stopped using the sub stance
9875,Still there is ongoing risk of relapse and the person needs to take care to prevent backsliding
9876,There will be need for ongoing support and treatment often in theform of a twelvestep group such as Alcoholics Anonymous AA
9877,There is also need forcontinuing attention to ways of handling emotions relationships and responsibilities
9878,In the final phase termination the person has successfully mastered the addic tion
9879,The temptation to use is no longer a significant danger
9880,Nonetheless people donot necessarily travel through these stages in a straightforward manner and there isfrequently movement back and forth between the stages
9881,Medications are available totreat withdrawal decrease drug cravings or reduce enjoyment of the substance
9882,Psychosocial treatments include a wide variety of therapies designed to help the addictedindividual choose to stop using the drug combat cravings and handle the emotionaland interpersonal challenges of daily life without resorting to substances
9883,Depending on the severity of the addiction including the motivation to stop the drug the level of functioning inthe community the presence of coexisting psychiatric or medical problems and thelevel of family support the addicted individual may need more or less structure intheir treatment
9884,Higher functioning individuals with less debilitating addictions maybe successfully treated in an outpatient setting or a twelvestep program such as Alcoholics Anonymous
9885,Ingeneral withdrawal is treated with a drug that is similar to the drug of abuse
9886,In thisway the individual is weaned off the chemical substance slowly
9887,Common medicationsfor alcohol withdrawal include a class of antianxiety drugs known as benzodiazepines ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESSHandy Psychology     PM  Page particularly diazepam brand name Valium and chlordiazepoxide Librium
9888,With drawal from opiates such as heroin opium morphine or oxycodone OxyContin isoften treated with methadone or clonidine
9889,Methadone maintenance is the most common pharmacological treatment of opiate addiction serving to reduce craving andwithdrawal
9890,Naltrexone is also used to reduce craving by blocking the reinforcingeffects of both opiates and alcohol
9891,Italso gives much less of a high than other opiates so it is less likely to be used as arecreational drug
9892,There is considerable research that methadone maintenancereduces the crime violence medical problems and mortality associated with severeopiate addiction
9893,Nonetheless there is controversy around methadone maintenancebecause many individuals may stay on methadone for many years rather than becoming entirely drugfree
9894,Drinking alcohol after taking disulfiram causes nausea vomiting and many otherunpleasant symptoms
9895,As the medication stays in the system for at least a week it can bea potent motivator not to drink
9896,Group therapies are useful indecreasing the stigma of the addiction confronting denial of the problem and providing encouragement and support for the struggle toward sobriety
9897,As social animals weare all highly suggestive to peer influences and tend to conform to group norms

9910,Therapists aim to reduce a patients suffering via verbal discussion
9911,Granted psychotherapy involves far more than just conversation but it isdistinguished from other kinds of therapiessuch as physical speech occupationalor medical therapyby its emphasis on talking
9912,one of the worlds first psychotherapy patients described it as the talking cure

9914,Otherwise there would be no need for trained professionalsfriends and family woulddo just as well
9915,It helps them learn abouttheir motivations emotions and behavior along with their effect on others
9916,With greater selfunderstanding people are better equipped to handle lifes chal lenges
9917,Additionally some people lack the necessary psychological skills to functionwell in life
9918,For example they could have difficulty managing anger negotiating conflict maintaining positive emotion confronting anxietyprovoking stimuli or controlling selfdestructive impulses
9919,Psychotherapy can teach people new skills to betterhandle these challenges
9920,Does psychotherapy work Originally there was little scientific data to back up psychotherapists claims about theeffectiveness of psychotherapy
9921,There now exists an entire field of psychotherapy research and there is substantial data supporting the positive effects of psychotherapy
9922,Consequently wecan now state with confidence Yes psychotherapy does work
9923,Additional schools of psychotherapy include family systems approaches and group psychotherapy
9924,The mental health questionnaire was sent out as part of a larger study polling readers on their opinions of appliances and services
9925,Out ofthe  people sent the questionnaire  responded and  answeredthe mental health questions
9926,Of these  people had discussed emotionalproblems with family friends or clergy  had turned to some combinationof mental health professionals support groups or family physicians and had consulted a mental health professional most frequently a psychologist psychiatrist  or social worker
9927,People treated by psychologists psychiatrists and social workers did better than those treated by other professionals and the difference waslarger over time
9928,No specific type of therapy worked better than any other
9929,Most psychotherapy studies are highly controlled efficacy studies with fixed length therapies manualized treatments and specific criteria for selecting patients
9930,This effectiveness study is much less con trolled but much more representative of the real world
9931,Patients pick their owntherapists present with all manner of problems and stay in therapy as long asthey and their therapist agree to continue
9932,If a treatment is not working the therapist may haveswitched to another approach
9933,Although there have been many developments since his death in  certain pillars of the discipline remain
9934,Psychoanalysis aims to alleviate emotional distress by bringing unconscious patterns ofthought emotion and desire into awareness
9935,This is done through longterm explorationof the persons mental processes in a onetoone relationship with the psychoanalyst
9936,Psychoanalysts also believe that early childhood experiences and relationships haveprofound influence on adult relationships
9937,Through the process of free associationunconscious childhood feelings and beliefs can emerge to be understood andreworked with the tools of a mature adult mind
9938,Psychodynamic psy chotherapy has adjusted to the financial and schedule constraints of modern life
9939,In typical psychodynamic therapy there are one to two fortyfive to fiftyminute sessionsper week
9940,Both therapist and patient sit up and face each other
9941,As with psychoanalysis psychodynamic therapy tends to be of indefinite length often for many years and relatively nondirective
9942,The therapist aims to guide selfexploration rather than provide answers or educate the patient in new modes ofbehavior
9943,In other words both psychoanalysis and psychodynamic therapy providesocial support and promote insight but neither one teaches specific skills
9944,Early in the development of psychoanalysis Freudrealized that analysands can develop inappropriately intense feelings about their analysts
9945,He quickly recognized this transference to be part of the clinical material believing the patient is likely to transfer his or her psychic conflicts onto the analyst
9946,Through exploring the analysands feelings about the analyst much can be learnedabout the inner workings of the analysands mind
9947,In the early days of psychoanalysis countertransference was seen mainly as a negative reflecting childish responses on the part of the analystthat were best suppressed and controlled
9948,In current approaches to psychodynamicwork countertransference is now incorporated into the therapeutic work
9949,Direct discussion of the relationship between therapist and patient can be awkward and stressful and the therapistmust introduce such topics carefully and in a constructive manner
9950,This means that contemporary psychoanalytic therapists no longer believe in the blank screen model of psychoanalysis
9951,In this model the patients experience within the therapy is seen solely as a product of the patients mental processes
9952,Contemporary psychoanalytic thinkers now believe that both therapist and patient contribute to the therapeutic relationship
9953,Moreover the emotional experience of the therapist can be a very valuable source of information both about the interpersonal process within the therapy and thepatients emotional experience
9954,For example if the therapist starts feeling annoyedand irritated during the session this might reflect passiveaggressive behavior on thepart of the patient
9955,Likewise if the therapist starts feeling sad this may reflect unacknowledged sad feelings on the part of the patient
9956,Clearly the therapists countertransference needs to be interpreted with caution so the patient is not unfairly heldaccountable for the therapists emotional state
9957,Through these mental manipulationswe keep ourselves blissfully unaware of uncomfortable information
9958,In her classic book The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defense  Anna Freud  listed ten defense mechanisms
9959,Anna Freud was the youngest of Sigmund Freuds six children
9960,ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESSHandy Psychology     PM  Page Types of Defense Mechanisms Defense Mechanism Explanation Displacement Here the person expresses feelings toward one person or situation that are really aimed at another
9961,Introjection In introjection people internalize the person or action that has caused anxiety thus moving from the passive to theactive role
9962,This is similar to the process ofidentifying with the aggressor
9963,Isolation In isolation the intellectual awareness of an event isdisconnected from emotional experience
9964,The person isaware of everything that happened but is completely out oftouch with the emotional meaning of the event
9965,Regression In regression a person avoids anxiety by reverting back to anearlier developmental stage
9966,For example adolescents afraidof their budding sexuality might regress to their presexualchildhood
9967,Repression Sigmund Freud believed repression to be the primary defense mechanism used to ward off threatening mentalcontent
9968,In repression disturbing emotions thoughts andmemories are pushed entirely out of awareness
9969,For example a rageful person becomes overlysolicitous of the other person
9970,Sublimation Here the person redirects the forbidden impulse into asocially valued activity
9971,For example childhood aggressionmay be sublimated into a career as a surgeon
9972,These principals were established through scientific researchconducted in the early twentieth century
9973,For example we may develop strong feelings about a particular song CS because we associate with anemotionally important time in our life UCS such as a romantic break up or greatvacation
9974,The new learned reaction is known as the conditioned response CR
9975,In these disorders the people have learned to associate various stimuli with fear
9976,To treat the anxiety disorder it is necessary to dissociate the feared object e
9977,In this way the conditioned stimulus dogs is disconnected from the conditioned response fear of dogs
9978,Techniques such as flooding andsystematic desensitization expose people to their feared objects either gradually systematic desensitization or all at once flooding
9979,The conditioned stimulusbecomes decoupled from the conditioned response and voil the person is no longerafraid of dogs
9980,Further a new association can be created between the formerly fearedobject and feelings of relaxation and calm
9981,In other words a pairing is made betweenthe conditioned stimulus and a new positive conditioned response
9982,Imagin ing a dog might get a rating of  seeing a picture of a dog a score of  and touchinga dog a score of
9983,Next the client is exposed to the situations listedon the hierarchy starting with the least anxietyprovoking imagining the dog andgradually moving up the list to the most anxietyprovoking petting the dog
9984,At eachpoint clients are instructed to use relaxation techniques until they can tolerate eachstep on the hierarchy without undue anxiety
9985,This is an extremely effective techniqueand it is used to help people overcome all manner of anxiety problems including thefear of flying public speaking heights or test taking
9986,Rewarded behaviors aremore likely to be repeated punished behaviors are less so
9987,Skinner  in the srelies on the principals of operant conditioning
9988,It employs carefully designed rewardsor positive reinforcement to encourage desirable behavior
9989,Alternatively punishment can be used to decrease frequency of undesirable behavior
9990,In sum behavioral modification changes behavior by manipulating the rewards andpunishments that motivate people to perform the behavior
9991,Such techniques are used in child rearing and animal training as well as the treat ment of emotionally disturbed children and individuals with mental retardation
9992,Operant conditioning techniques are also widely used in situations requiring some degree ofsocial control for example in prisons schools and even the workplace
9993,For the most part people seeking out psychotherapy on their own do so because they are already motivated to change
9994,Previously behaviorists had thoroughly dismissed subjective experiences as unworthy of Handy Psychology     PM  Page scientific attention
9995,Taking advantage of this movement psychologists such as Aaron Beck  Albert Ellis  and Martin Seligman  developed anew form of psychotherapy known as cognitive psychotherapy
9996,All three branches of cognitive therapy start from the premise that psychological distress can be linked to maladaptive thoughts
9997,The negative consequencesof these patterns reinforce the problematic thoughts creating a vicious cycle
9998,Are there positive consequences that motivate the person to perform the behavior Often the answer isnot so obvious
9999,One of the basic techniques of behavioral therapy is functional behavioral analysis
10000,First the child cries to get her parents back into the room
10001,At that point the motherspends up to  minutes with the child cleaning her up and soothing her
10002,Thisfunctional analysis makes clear that vomiting is reinforcing for the childbecause it brings her mothers attention
10003,The treatment for this kind of problemwould be to change the contingencies of the childs crying
10004,Instead of entering the room to reassure the child in response to the childs crying the parentshould enter the room at a fixed time interval
10005,This way the childs crying losesthe power to control the parents behavior
10006,The parent first enters the room at afrequent rate so that the child is only left alone for short time periods
10007,The parent then spaces out the time intervals so that the child slowly adapts to fallingasleep without the parent
10008,This process is the basis of the Ferber method a wellknown technique for conditioning babies to sleep through the night
10009,These are habitual ways of thinking that contribute to a depressive mindset
10010,Information is distorted to maintain a negative and pessimistic world view
10011,In his book Feeling Good The New Mood Therapy the psychiatrist David Burns listed the following cognitive distortions
10012,If you are not com pletely successful you are a total failure
10013,Overgeneralization You generalize from a single negative event to a much larg er pattern
10014,Mental Filter You hone in on one negative detail and let that detail cloud your view of the larger picture
10015,Disqualifying the Positive You find reasons to discount positive information
10016,The cute girl next door was nice to youbecause she felt sorry for you
10017,This type of cognitive distortion allows you tomaintain your negative view of the world despite contradictory evidence
10018,Jumping to Conclusions You jump to negative conclusions in the absence of any evidence
10019,Predicting the Future You predict that things will end up badly and then treat your predictions as if they were already fact
10020,Catastrophizing or Minimizing In catastrophic thinking you exaggerate the negative impact or significance of an event blowing it up into giant proportions
10021,Emotional Reasoning You dont distinguish between your emotions and out side reality
10022,Just because you feel something you assume it must be true
10023,Shoulding You feel you can only motivate yourself with a constant sense of guilt or obligation
10024,You should must or ought to do all sorts of things
10025,You cannot trust yourself to act appropriately unless you are forced to do so
10026,Labeling A negative event or behavior is generalized to the persons entire char acter
10027,For example your husband is a selfish lout you are a pathetic wreck andyour neighbor is total snob
10028,Personalization You assume that you were the cause of something that may have had nothing to do with you
10029,Your boss shuts himself in his office becausehes mad at you
10030,Humanistic therapiesas championed by psychotherapists such as Carl Rogers Fritz Perls  Victor Frankl  and Rollo Maywere considered the third force in psychology providing an alternativeto the two earlier movements
10031,While psychoanalysis focused on the relief of psychological conflict and behaviorism focused on changing behavior humanistic psychologyemphasized the potential for growth
10032,Concepts such as selfactualization unconditional positive regard and the search for meaning highlighted the basic human need to find fulfillment happiness and meaning in life
10033,The aim of humanistic therapy is less the reduction of psychopathology than the realization of human potential
10034,Emphasis is less on the past as with psychoanalysis andpsychodynamic therapies and more on the present
10035,Both types of therapy engage the patient in oneonone discussions witha psychotherapist
10036,Both presume that verbal exploration of emotionally relevant thoughtsfeelings and problems can help people improve their lives
10037,Theyare then asked to tell that person everything that they are feeling
10038,Interestingly the empty chair technique has similarities with the behavioral technique of systematic desensitization
10039,By practicing a feared conversation without the actualperson present the client is asked to confront something anxietyprovoking at a lowerlevel of anxiety
10040,If the person can master the anxiety at that lower intensity presumably heor she can move from there onto the more challenging situation
10041,Hopefully the personcan progress from talking to the empty chair to a conversation with the actual person
10042,Family therapists challenged the emphasis on the indi vidual a fundamental part of all earlier forms of psychotherapy
10043,In family systemstheory it is believed that families operate as systems and that no one member of thefamily can be understood in isolation from the other members of the family
10044,Although there are many strains of family therapy including the structural family therapy of Salvador Minuchin the strategic family therapy of Jay Haley and the experiential family therapy of Carl Whitaker and Virginia Satir all family therapists believein bringing the entire family or key members into the room
10045,Family therapists address the patterns of interaction between family members
10046,Are the mother and the oldest child allying together against the father Is the childacting out at school to force his estranged parents to talk to each other Are the parents failing to set adequate boundaries with their children giving the children toomuch power Family therapy works by helping family members gain insight intotheir problematic patterns and then work together to change
10047,Unlike psychodynamictherapy family therapy addresses the present patterns of interaction with far lessemphasis on the past although past history is recognized if it has contributed to present patterns
10048,The theory behind family therapy is that individuals do not operate in isolation but instead are part of a complex family system
10049,It is therefore important for the therapist to understand the entire family in order to treat one of its members  iStock
10050,Behavioral therapy is most effective foranxiety disorders such as phobias panic disorder and obsessivecompulsive disorder
10051,Cognitive therapy is highly effective in mild to moderate depression
10052,Impulsive andcompulsive behaviors such as pathological gambling selfinjurious behaviors andpoor anger management respond well to skillsbuilding therapies using bothbehavioral and cognitive components
10053,People with mild to moderate personality disorders respond to longterm insight oriented treatments such as psychodynamic therapy although people with severe personality disorders may also need skillsbuilding treatments
10054,For example dialecticalbehavioral therapy DBT is specifically designed to treat borderline personality disorder
10055,It is based on behavioral principles and makes use of functional behavioral analyses but also addresses the poor emotional regulation and problematic interpersonalrelationships associated with this disorder
10056,Certainlywith shortterm problems that are not particularly severe many people can providereassurance and support without years of professional training
10057,Moreover the differencebetween the two grew the longer people stayed in treatment
10058,Among therapist factors personality variablessuch as genuineness and empathy as perceived by the patient are very important
10059,If the therapist believes thatthe therapy can help this contributes to a positive outcome
10060,Among patient variablesmotivation to change hope and positive expectations of the therapy promote positiveresults
10061,General functioning level and degree of social support also contribute to therapy outcome
10062,Many studies also stress the centrality of the ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESSHandy Psychology     PM  Page therapeutic alliance
10063,As in any relationship this is to some extent apersonal decision
10064,A therapist may provide a perfect fit for one person but not click aswell with his or her friend
10065,As noted above someproblems are best treated with specific types of therapy for example anxiety disordersrespond very well to behavioral therapy
10066,The personality style of the therapist will also affect the type of therapy that is pro vided
10067,Some therapists are gentle and supportive while others tend more towardtough love
10068,Some patients may prefer the first type of therapist while others mayfind such a therapist too soft and prefer to be challenged
10069,Cognitivebehavioral therapies tend to be short term while humanisticand psychodynamic therapies tend to be longer
10070,Research suggests that minor and relatively recent problems may notrequire longterm treatment while more severe complex and long lasting problemswill take more time
10071,The length of the treatment also depends on the preferences ofthe patient
10072,Some patients are happy with resolution of the presenting symptom and choose to stop treatment as soon as there is symptomatic improvement
10073,Other patients areinterested in greater selfexploration and personality development and stay in therapymuch longer
10074,Once doomed to a life of anguish utter dysfunction and often squalid conditions many people with mental illness can now live satisfying lives in the community
10075,Although modern psychopharmacology has broughttremendous benefits it is not without complications
10076,Secondly the drugs are only effective if they are taken as prescribed
10077,Nonadherence to medication is probably the single greatest reason for treatment failure
10078,Finally clinical trialsresearch into the efficacy and safety of certain medications are extremely expensive
10079,Consequently some professionals and patients are concerned about the safety of takingmedications especially for long periods of time
10080,These drugs are divided into two general categories typicals and atypicals
10081,Typical antipsychotics are highly effective drugs but have a range of problematic side effects
10082,Anticholinergic effects including dry mouth blurred vision and confusion are found in low potency typicals such as chlorpromazine and thioridazine
10083,Extrapyramidal side effects EPS are more common in highpotency typicals such ashaloperidol and fluphenazine
10084,ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESSHandy Psychology     PM  Page Atypical antipsychotics include risperidone Risperdal olanzapine Zyprexa que tiapine Seroquel ziprasidone Geodon and aripiprazole Aricept
10085,The atypicals entered the market in the s although the first atypical clozapine Clozaril wasintroduced considerably earlier but fell out of favor due to the risk of agranulocytosisa potentially fatal disorder of the white blood cells
10086,Atypicals work on a range of neurotransmitters including serotonin dopamine and norepinephrine
10087,While atypicals areless likely to cause the kinds of side effects associated with typical antipsychotics theybring their own sideeffect profile
10088,Most importantly atypicals have a higher risk ofmetabolic syndrome characterized by insulin resistance high blood pressure weightgain and high blood sugar
10089,It is now considered perhaps the most effective antipsychotic medication
10090,The table below lists commonly used drugs and their uses
10091,Not only did the atypicals have a more Handy Psychology     PM  Page benign side effect profile than the typicals atypicals were assumed to be more effective in treating both the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia
10092,Positive symptoms refer to the active psychotic symptoms and negative symptoms to the social withdrawal reduced energy and emotional flattening associated with schizophrenia
10093,The CATIE study is a landmark study published in  that challenged assumptions about the superiority of atypicals over typicals
10094,While olanzapineZyprexa proved superior to perphenizine it also had the highest rates of metabolic sideeffects
10095,Of note this study was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health a government institution
10096,Commonly prescribed SSRIs include fluoxetine Prozacsertraline Zoloft citalopram Celexa and paroxetine Paxil
10097,SSRIs are very effectiveand safer than other classes of antidepressants but they do have side effects the mostbothersome being sexual side effects
10098,SSRIs are also helpful in the treatment of anxiety conditions and obsessivecompulsive disorder
10099,ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESS Although some psychologists are licensed to prescribe medications psychiatrists or primary care doctors prescribe most psychia tric drugs iStock
10100,Handy Psychology     PM  Page Prior to the arrival of the SSRIs in the s heterocyclics were the most fre quently prescribed class of antidepressants
10101,Commonly used heterocyclics include imipramine Tofranil amitriptyline Elavil and nortriptyline Pamelor
10102,They also impact the histaminic and and acetylcholine neurotransmitter systems
10103,They aremore lethal on overdose and can have notable cardiac side effects
10104,MAOIs were discovered in the early s and their potentially lethal effects came tolight in the early s
10105,These crises can be brought on by mixing an MAOI with another medication such as opioids or SSRIs or by eating tyraminerich foods
10106,Aged cheese cured meats sausageand liqueurs are all rich in tyramine
10107,Although MAOIs are the most dangerous of the antidepressants they are also extremely effective
10108,Barbituates suchas secobarbitol Seconal and pentobarbital Nembutol are the older class of drugs
10109,Today they are rarely prescribed as conventional antianxiety medications because of theirproblematic sideeffect profile
10110,Barbituates have a high risk of addiction and high lethalityon overdose
10111,They also have cardiac effects at high doses and can dangerously depress respiration suppress breathing
10112,Benzodiazepines have largely taken the place of barbituates in the treatment of anxiety
10113,Medications such as alprazolam Xanax lorazepam Ativan clonazepamKlonopin and diazepam Valium have far lower risk of death on overdose and tend tobe less addictive than barbituates
10114,Nonetheless benzodiazepines can still be addictiveand abrupt discontinuation of the drug can put a person into withdrawal
10115,The drugshalflife amount of time needed for the drug to clear the body influences the addictionpotential
10116,Benzodiazepines with a short halflife such as alprazolam have higher riskof withdrawal and addiction than those with longer halflives such as clonazepam
10117,The most common mood stabi Handy Psychology     PM  Page lizers are lithium valproic acid Depakine and carbamazepine Tegretol
10118,Unlike the other classes of psychiatricdrugs mood stabilizers are not clearly linked to specific neurotransmitters
10119,Somemood stabilizers alter the sodium channels in the cell membrane and some seem towork on the GABA neurotransmitter system
10120,Most mood stabilizers also function asantiseizure medications anticonvulsants including carbamazepine and valproic acid
10121,Additional antiseizure medications that are used to stabilize mood include gabapentinNeurontin lamotrogine Lamictal and topiramate Topamax
10122,Will drugs ever replace psychotherapy In the late s during the explosive growth of the SSRIs there was idle talk of drugsreplacing psychotherapy
10123,Medications treat symptoms and they are enormously helpful with themost severe mental illnesses
10124,Medications are extremely effective with psychosis mania severe depression anxiety and agitation
10125,Alternatively psychotherapyis effective with problematic personality traits disturbed selfimage and impairedinterpersonal skills
10126,Specific psychotherapies are also effective in the treatment of anxiety disorders and mild to moderate depression
10127,Although medications generally workmore quickly on depression and anxiety psychotherapy tends to have more longlasting effects and certainly has fewer side effects
10128,Mostactual drug development takes place in industry laboratories paid for by the extremelylarge and wealthy pharmaceutical industry
10129,Once a drug is developed it must be testedfor efficacy safety and tolerability
10130,Safety relates to the absence of dangerous side effects otherwise known asadverse events
10131,In Phase I studies the drug must prove tolerable and safe in a small sample of ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESSHandy Psychology     PM  Page healthy volunteers twenty to eighty subjects
10132,In Phase II studies the drug must prove tolerable and safe in a larger sample of patients  to  subjects with someevidence of efficacy
10133,In an RCT a large sample of patients are randomly assigned to receive either the test treatment or a comparison treatment
10134,The comparison drug may be another active drug or may be a placebo sham treatment that lookslike an active drug
10135,Studies must also be doubleblinded that is neither doctor norpatient should be able to tell whether the patient is taking the drug or the placebo
10136,Atthe end of a set period symptom improvement is compared across groups
10137,The efficacyof the drug reflects the improvement of symptoms in patients taking the active treatment rather than the placebo
10138,Theplacebo effect refers to the improvement seen in patients on placebo
10139,It can be enor mously reassuring just to see a doctor and receive pills even if there is no activeingredient in the pills
10140,The placebo effect is a real phenomenon and can reach  to percent in some treatment studies
10141,Therefore it is necessary to include a placebo control in a treatment study in order to prove that patient improvement is due to theactive ingredient in the drug and not just to the placebo effect
10142,government agency SAMHSA list sedatives pain relievers stimulants and tranquilizers as the most common candidates for prescription drug abuse
10143,Drugs with aquick onset of action a tendency to cause euphoric feelings and a short halflifeare more vulnerable to misuse
10144,Consequently they have no incentive to spend millions of dollars on high qualityobjective studies that could potentially reflect badly on their own product
10145,Clearly independent sources of funding are needed to support highquality and impartial drugtodrug comparisons
10146,With this philosophical and political shift the pharmaceutical industry hasgained more freedom to market directly to consumers and engage in joint researchwith academic centers
10147,Along with the tremendous advances in psychiatric medications the pharmaceuti cal industry has grown extremely profitable and has become integrated into all aspectsof psychiatric research publishing and training
10148,Unfortunately there is little in the way of independent investigation such as the CATIE study to give unbiased information about the relative effectiveness of differentmedications
10149,This is not to suggest that clinical research sponsored by the pharmaceuticals is invalid only that it is far from impartial and few companies are likely to publish studies that might adversely affect their bottom line
10150,In his  study by Robert Kelly and colleagues see illustration the authors looked at  articles involving data on  drugs many studies looked at the samedrugs
10151,Whether the outcome of the study was favorable or not favorable for each drugwas recorded along with the source of research funding
10152,For drugs in studies funded by the manufacturers competitors only of the studies had favorable outcomes
10153,Finally for drugs in studies that received nofunding from pharmaceutical companies  percent of the outcomes were favorable
10154,Drug companies are more likely to publish studies that support their product and less likely to publish studies that fail to do so
10155,ECT stands for electroconvulsive therapy otherwise known as shock therapy
10156,Elec trodes are placed at several locations on the skull and a small pulse of electricity issent through the electrodes into the brain
10157,This causes a seizure generally of twentyto thirty seconds in duration
10158,Despite its scary reputation ECT is very effective insevere depression
10159,It is particularly effective in melancholic depression or depression with a lot of neurovegetative symptoms
10160,This refers to the physical symptoms of depression such as loss of energy sleep and appetite disturbance impaired concentration and physical slowing
10161,The side effect profile of ECT is reasonable especially ifdone infrequently
10162,The most common side effect is loss of memory from around thetime of the treatments
10163,have such a bad reputation Compared to many biological treatments used in psychiatry ECT is quite old datingback to the s
10164,Handy Psychology     PM  Page and it is now used much more carefully than it was fifty years ago
10165,In the past ECT was commonly used with a much wider range of disorders than it is now
10166,Today it is mainly used to treat depressionalthough it can also treat mania and psychosis
10167,Much higher dosages of electricity were used in the past than are used today
10168,Unilateral ECT tends to have fewer sideeffects though it is not as powerful as bilateral ECT
10169,Finally muscle relaxants were not commonly used so patients could get hurt during seizures even breaking bones
10170,Currently patients are given muscle relaxantsand put under general anaesthesia prior to ECT
10171,Additionally electronic monitoring machines help ensurethat breathing and heartbeat remain normal throughout the procedure
10172,The benefit of pop psychology is that it is accessible to a very wide audience and can be an effective vehicle for translating psychological knowledge to the general public
10173,The downside is that there is little to no quality control
10174,The information may or may not bebacked by solid psychological science or clinical experience
10175,As longas there have been human beings there has been interest in human behavior
10176,For many centuries religious figures filled this function although soothsayers fortunetellers and other occult figures also came intoplay
10177,Since the rise of the professional mental health fields speakers with academic or medical credentials have gained in popularity
10178,Some psychologists or mental health professionals doenter the field of popular psychology but there is nothing stopping someone with adoctorate in French literature from using the appellation Dr
10179,Thus much of popular psychology functionsmore as entertainment than as scientifically based psychological knowledge

10182,EstherEppie Friedman Lederer  assumed the Ann Landers advice column forthe Chicago SunTimes in
10183,Her plainspoken common sense adviceappealed to a great many people and her column was eventually syndicated to over newspapers
10184,In  her twin sister Pauline Popo Friedman Philips began arival column Dear Abby in the San Francisco Chronicle under the pen name Abi gail Van Buren
10185,Although neither sister had any training in the mental health fieldthey took care to clarify the limits of their knowledge and abilities and often advised Handy Psychology     PM  Page their readers to seek professional help if their problems seemed beyond the scope of a newspaper advice column
10186,Phil Phillip McGraw  is a widely known television personality best known as Dr
10187,in clinical psychology from the University of North Texas in
10188,Phil was licensed in Texas and opened a practice for a short while but movedout of the business of psychotherapy into both popular and forensic psychology
10189,She works primarily in radio but hasalso published a number of books
10190,Laura Schlessinger  has a doctorate in physiology from Columbia University but also obtained a postdoctoral certificate in Marriage Child and Family Counseling from the University of Southern California
10191,Laura is known for her sociallyconservative views and for combining moral religious and mental health considerations into her responses to viewers
10192,A traumatic event can involve direct threat tothe self but people can also feel traumatized after witnessing harm or threat of harmto someone else
10193,Traumas can include natural disasters such as an earthquake tsunami or hurricane but traumas can also stem from human behavior as with warassault or rape
10194,Trauma in general has been associated with anxiety depression increased drinking anger outbursts suicidal behavior and a syndrome known as  THE  PSYCHOLOGY OF TRAUMAHandy Psychology     PM  Page posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD
10195,While personality in adulthood is largely formed personality is still developing in childhood
10196,Thus chronic trauma in child hood can have extremely pervasive and longterm effects on personality development
10197,People with histories of serious childhood abuse can develop severe personality disorders
10198,These involve feelings of unreality and disconnection from mental and physical experience
10199,There is astriking lack of awareness of certain feelings thoughts or actions
10200,Peoplewould complain of various bodily problems that had no basis in actual physiology
10201,In other words hysteria stemmed from earlyexperiences of childhood sexual abuse
10202,Within a few years Freud abandoned this theory believing that hysteria was too com mon to have been solely caused by sexual abuse
10203,This would have meant that far morechildren were sexually abused than he believed was likely
10204,He replaced his focus on actualexperience with an emphasis on fantasy
10205,The child may not have actually been seducedbut instead had repressed fantasies of seduction by the mother or father
10206,With this turnfrom actual traumatic events to traumatic fantasies the study of childhood trauma wentunderground for more than half a century not to reemerge until the s and s
10207,Young men were sent away from home and exposed to theconstant threat of their own death and to the violent and bloody death of their comrades
10208,They were also forced to perform violent and murderous acts themselves sometimes against civilians
10209,Many soldiers returning from WWI exhibited the emotional distress we now know as posttraumatic stress disorder
10210,But there Handy Psychology     PM  Page was little validation of these soldiers suffering at the time and it was often seen as a sign of moral weakness
10211,In World War II the problem recurred sometimes referred toas battle fatigue and there was some progress in the study treatment and recognition of posttraumatic psychopathology
10212,In five years after the end of the Vietnam War the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder was published in DSMIII
10213,The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual DSM is the official diagnostic manual for the mental health field
10214,There are three clusters of symptoms persistent avoidance ofreminders of the event numbing symptoms persistent reexperiencing of the eventintrusive symptoms  and autonomic hyperarousal
10215,With numbing symptoms there is a blunting of emotional reactivity
10216,There is flat affect avoidance of various activitiesloss of memory for traumatic events and lack of motivation or interest in activitiesthat used to engage the person
10217,Instead of a lack of memory for the traumatic events there is a flood of memories thatcannot be turned off
10218,There may also be intrusive emotionalstorms such as crying spells rage outbursts or panic attacks
10219,With autonomic hyperarousal the autonomic nervous system is on overdrive
10220,The body is continually onguard ready to spring into action at any sign of danger
10221,There can be an exaggeratedstartle response difficulty concentrating and difficulty sleeping as well as rapid heartbeat sweating and continued muscle tension
10222,There are many different kinds of traumasand different people respond to the same event in different ways
10223,A number of factorswithin the trauma affect the risk of developing PTSD
10224,Whether the trauma was naturalor manmade and whether the humaninduced trauma was accidental e
10225,The duration ofthe trauma is important as wellwas it quick or did it last over time Whether the trauma was a onetime event or ongoing e
10226,Longermore chronic more severe and intentionally malicious traumas cause greater psychological damage than shorter milder singleepisode and unintentional traumas
10227,We are profoundly socialanimals and a good deal of our psychologyis devoted to the negotiation of interpersonal relationships
10228,If we suffer significantharm at the hands of another person thatcan throw our entire worldview intodoubt
10229,Are people still good Can otherpeople be trusted While the loss of a senseof safety regarding our physical surroundings can be enormously frightening we donot expect morality from the weather
10230,Anatural disaster does not in itself threaten our fundamental belief in the decency of humanity
10231,People with anexternal locus of control believe that outside forces determine the events in their life
10232,They do not believe they have much control over their life
10233,In contrast people with aninternal locus of control believe they have significant control over their life
10234,They tend to be more optimistic and more proactive about solving problems
10235,To start with trauma involves an intenseactivation of our stress response
10236,The HPA axis hypothalamus pituitary gland adren  Although living through a natural disaster such as a fire or earthquake can result in emotional trauma trauma that isinflicted by other people is much worse emotionally  iStock
10237,Handy Psychology     PM  Page al gland mediates our brains stress response
10238,In the face of stress the HPA axis is activated
10239,These serve to activate the autonomous nervous system making our heart pump faster our breath morerapid and shallow and blood rush to our large muscle groups from our small musclegroups
10240,In normal circumstances our parasympathetic nervous system acts to restore this system to a resting state allowing our body to recover from the stress reaction
10241,This has the effect of wearing down the body compromising the immune system and putting undue stresson many parts of the bodys regulating systems
10242,People cut off aware ness of feelings thoughts or even memories of actual events
10243,Sometimes peopleremember all of the events but feel entirely emotionally detached from the memories
10244,Alternatively they may feel detached from personal experience as if they are not a realperson but a robot
10245,During the trauma some people remember slipping into dissociative states
10246,Although dissociation may help people survive trauma dissociative symptoms cancause problems after the trauma is over interfering with the persons ability toprocess the trauma and return to normal life
10247,Are traumatic memories really repressed There has been a good deal of controversy over the issue of repressed memories
10248,Often the recovery of memoriesis associated with a surge of intrusive posttraumatic symptoms such as nightmaresemotional outbursts and even suicidality
10249,Partly in response to this excess there are factions within the mental health field that discount the possibility of recovered memories at all
10250,She became well known for challenging the idea of recovered memories
10251,In other words it doesnt takethat much to convince people that they remember things that never actually happened
10252,Loftuss work highlights the risk of eliciting recovered memories of childhoodtrauma in psychotherapy
10253,Clinicians must take pains to avoid leadingquestions and always keep in mind that the absence of memory may simply mean theabsence of abuse
10254,Immediately after an acute trauma people need help in reducing their autonomic arousal
10255,They need to be assured thatthey are safe and that it is safe to let down their guard
10256,If symptoms of PTSD develop individual therapy with cognitivebehavioral techniquescan help reduce symptoms
10257,Relaxation techniques can reduce the autonomic hyperarousal gradual desensitization can help people overcome tendencies to avoid anyreminder of the trauma and psychoeducation can help people make sense of theirreactions to the trauma
10258,Distorted cognitions about the trauma should also beaddressed particularly excessive selfblame
10259,Selfblame is a common reaction to trauma as it serves to combat the extreme sense of helplessness
10260,Likewise people do need to feelempowered and constructive actions that grant some sense of control should be encouraged
10261,For example letter writing to newspapers or government officials public speakingabout the event and commemoration rituals can all help people feel empowered
10262,Handy Psychology     PM  Page Is longterm childhood trauma treated differently than acute trauma in adulthood With more chronic childhood trauma the therapy takes more time and needs to move more slowly
10263,The therapy should first address any severe problems with functioning such as selfmutilation suicidality and severe personality pathology
10264,With some people this can happen fairly quickly withothers it might take years
10265,Some people with very fragile emotional and behavioralcontrol may never fully process the trauma
10266,Instead the therapy will focus on shoringup selfcontrol capacities and the general ability to function
10267,Maltreatment can range from failure to attend to the childs fundamental needs to intentionally inflicting harm
10268,Child maltreatment is generally divided into four categories neglect emotional or psychological abuse physical abuse and sexual abuse
10269,Child maltreatment hasreceived a good deal of attention within the field of psychology because of its extremely damaging and farreaching effectschild abuse leaves its mark on almost allaspects of psychological functioning
10270,Department of Health and Human Services compiles statistics on cases ofchild maltreatment that are reported to the authorities
10271,According to these statisticsin  there were almost  incidents of child maltreatment in the UnitedStates
10272,Over half the reports involved neglect  percent multiple forms of abuse
10273,We can assume that the real incidence of abuse is far higher
10274,These statistics come fromthe  report on Child Mistreatment by the U
10275,Department of Health and Human THE PSYCHOLOGY OF TRAUMAHandy Psychology     PM  Page Services
10276,While psychological abuse is listed as the second least common type of abuse reported to the authorities this probably has little relationship to its frequency in the population
10277,We can presume it is one of the most common forms of abuse but becauseit does not put the child in immediate physical danger it is likely underreported
10278,Types of Child Abuse Reported in the United States in  Type of Mistreatment Percentage Neglect
10279,Department of Health and Human Services  statistics par ents were the most frequent perpetrators of child abuse in the cases reported to theauthorities
10280,percent of the cases and themother plus another person in
10281,percent of the cases the father plus another person in
10282,percent of the casesand the mother and father together in
10283,Unrelated romantic partners of the parentsalso accounted for a small percent of the cases reported
10284,While adultshave largely formed personalities childrens psychological capacities are not yet fullydeveloped
10285,Child abuse interferes with the childs psychological development stuntingor distorting the childs growing ability to regulate emotion control impulses plan andfollow through with goals negotiate interpersonal relationships and maintain a stableand positive selfimage
10286,Consequently child abuse raises the risk ofanxiety depression impulse control disorders and severe personality pathologythroughout the lifespan
10287,Most tragically the abuse can teach the child that the world iscruel and uncaring and that the child is unworthy of love protection or respect
10288,Trauma can hinder mylenation the growth of a fatty insulation around the neurons axon
10289,Myelin improves the speed of electrical impulses travelling across the neuron
10290,Trauma can also hinder synaptogenesis the formation of connections between cells as well as the morphology or shape of the cell itself
10291,Altogether this reduces the density and connectivity of the brain
10292,Moreover brain cells are damaged in areas of the braininvolved with emotion memory and behavioral control
10293,Such areas include the amygdala the hippocampus and the frontal lobe
10294,In complex PTSD there are longterm changes in attention memory consciousness regulation of emotion and personality characteristics including unstable distorted and negative selfperceptionsand problematic interpersonal relationships
10295,These problems can result in the dissociation selfmutilation selfdestructive behaviors and emotional storms that are oftenfound with survivors of severe childhood abuse
10296,While chronic PTSD is not an officialdiagnosis it is currently being evaluated for inclusion in future editions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual DSM
10297,Violent cruel frequentand longlasting abuse obviously has more of an effect than milder abuse
10298,The greater the emotionaldependence on the perpetrator and the closer the relationship the greater the damage
10299,Consequently abusive mothers do the most damage followed by abusive fathersother relatives friends acquaintances and then strangers
10300,After age four the incidence of mistreatment goes down only to rise again in adolescence for girls but not boys
10301,The increasein the mistreatment of teenage girls is probably due to an increase in sexual assaults THE PSYCHOLOGY OF TRAUMAHandy Psychology     PM  Page starting at that time
10302,These statistics come from the  report on Child Mistreat ment by the U
10303,Percent of Child Abuse Victims by Age and Sex in  Age  Boys  Girls   yr
10304,percent of the total number of mistreatment cases involve neglectof children under the age of four
10305,As you can see neglect becomes less common aschildren get older while sexual abuse becomes more common
10306,These statistics come from the  report on Child Mistreatment by the U
10307,Percentage of Different Kinds of Abuse at Different Ages in the United States  Abuse Type  yrs
10308,Frequently the parents of abused children have a history of child abuse in their own families
10309,It isif they have learned automatically to treat children the way they have been treated
10310,Moreover several factors buffer the effect of childhood Handy Psychology     PM  Page abuse
10311,For example victims of child abuse with greater levels of educationsocial support and financial security areless likely to abuse their own children
10312,Likewise if the abuse is addressedpromptly and the child protected fromfurther harm this can do a good deal torestore the childs faith in the world
10313,Thisis simplest if the abuser is not a closefamily member
10314,Hopefully such help can protect against some of the negative psychological effects thatoften follow experiences of child abuse
10315,Further connections with institutions thatfoster relationships with the larger community e
10316,school church appropriate discipline in the home and family stability protect against the negative psychologicaleffects of child abuse
10317,In fact there are estimates that as much as onethird of children from abusive backgrounds grow up to be reasonably healthy and welladjusted adults
10318,Research has found several factors are associated withresilience in children intelligence the ability to make emotional connections withpeople outside the family moderate selfcontrol positive selfimage and an internallocus of control all promote resilience
10319,People with an internal locus of control believethey have reasonable control over their environment and that their actions make a difference
10320,In addition resilient survivors of child abuse are less likely than their lessresilient counterparts to blame themselves for the abuse
10321,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF TRAUMA Child abuse is often passed down generation to generation but the cycle can be broken
10322,The majority of child abuse victims do not grow up to be abusers themselves  iStock
10323,According to a definition used by Joan Liem JacquelineJames and colleagues in a  study sexual abuse involves any form of coercive sexual contact with an underage child or any sexual contact between a child thirteenyears or younger and someone five or more years older
10324,Although the exact statutesvary state by state any adult sexual contact with an underage child is against the law
10325,Sexual abuse ranges from exposure of genitals to fondling of body parts to direct genital contact and ultimately to anal or vaginal intercourse
10326,Arguably sexual abuse maybe the most psychologically damaging form of child abuse
10327,Is sexual abuse violent The vast majority of incidents of child molestation are not violent
10328,Most child molesters use manipulation or seduction to gain access to their child victims
10329,A sizeablenumber of child molesters use just enough force to accomplish their goal
10330,Department of Health there were approximately  cases of child sexual abuse reported to the authorities   percent involved children under the age of twelve
10331,In fact the diagnosis of complex PTSD was developedlargely out of the study of sexual abuse survivors
10332,Borderline personality disorder isalso strongly linked to child sexual abuse
10333,Not surprisingly many sexual abuse survivors also have disturbances in their sexual functioning as adults
10334,Some survivorsbecome overcontrolled sexually with intense fear of and aversion to sexual contact
10335,Handy Psychology     PM  Page Others go to the opposite extreme and become sexually promiscuous engaging in compulsive driven and often reckless sexual behavior
10336,Is sexual abuse transmitted across generations Like many forms of child abuse sexual abuse can be transmitted across generations
10337,Again this is not to say that allchildhood sexual abuse victims will grow up to abuse their own children
10338,Nonetheless parents of abused children are morelikely to have their own abuse histories than are parents of nonabused children
10339,Victims of incestuous abuse tend to experience more frequent invasive and longterm sexual abuse asthe perpetrator has ongoing and convenient access to the victim
10340,Not only is the child affected by the sexual abuseitself the childs entire view of interpersonal relationships is distorted by the incestuous relationship
10341,The abuser is notacting as a caretaker but as a user and exploiter of the child
10342,For example somechild molesters sexually assault children not because they are sexually attracted to children but because the child is a convenient target because they are intoxicated or forsome other reason
10343,Some people withstrong and persistent sexual attraction to children may never act on their urges
10344,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF TRAUMAHandy Psychology     PM  Page Are there different kinds of pedophilia There have been several categorizations of pedophilia but perhaps the most useful involves the distinction between true pedophiles and opportunistic pedophiles
10345,Opportunistic pedophiles have less of a focused sexual attraction to children
10346,Their sexual engagement with children may depend on circumstances such as theconvenient availability of a child victim loss of normal inhibitions due to substanceabuse or difficulty feeling comfortable with an adult sexual partner
10347,In this wayopportunistic pedophiles may overlap with nonpedophilic child molesters
10348,Three possible causes include inadequate social skillsneurological impairment or brain damage and the pedophiles own history of childhood sexual abuse
10349,Do pedophiles lack mature social skills Researchers and clinicians have suggested that pedophiles have poor selfesteem andinadequate social skills and turn to children out of fear of pursuing adult relationships
10350,While this may be true for some pedophiles it is clearly not true for many others as therehave been many high functioning socially competent and even married pedophiles
10351,Is pedophilia caused by neurological damage  There is also research suggesting that pedophiles suffer from some sort of neurologicaldisturbance or brain damage
10352,There have also been cases of people developing pedophilia after suffering brain damage
10353,Therefore it is not clear if the biological findings are related topedophilia per se or to other problems common with a criminal population
10354,Were pedophiles sexually abused as children There does seem to be a clear relationship between sexual abuse in childhood andthe development of pedophilia in adulthood
10355,Moreover pedophiles have a higher rate of childhood sexual abuse thando nonsexual criminals and even sexual offenders against adults
10356,In these cases clues may be found in the behavior of thechild
10357,There may be a marked change in the childs behavior including a sudden onsetof anxiety depression social withdrawal reduced selfesteem or sleep disturbances
10358,Apreviously welladjusted child may suddenly start acting truant perform poorly inschool or lose or gain a good deal of weight
10359,Unusual or predatory sexual behavior inthe child can be another clue that the child has experienced sexual abuse
10360,A suddenfear or aversion to a particular adult may also be a clue
10361,Of course behavioral changeslike these can be due to many other causes besides sexual abuse
10362,Nonetheless it is important to recognize that children cannot alwaysverbalize that they have been abused and may express their suffering through markedchanges in their behavior
10363,Generally this refers to a husband and wife but it can also apply to unmarried couples that do or do not live together
10364,Domestic violence can also occur between homosexual couples either gay men or lesbians
10365,The severity of violence can range from mildaggression such as a slap or a shove to severe aggression punching kicking toextreme aggression long assaults burning or breaking bones and even to murder
10366,Wife battering is a more specific term THE PSYCHOLOGY OF TRAUMAHandy Psychology     PM  Page and refers to a systematic pattern of intimidation control terror and physical vio lence inflicted upon a woman by her male partner
10367,The intent of such behavior is togain total control over the woman
10368,Police would brush off domestic violence as a privatefamily matter the clergy would emphasize the need to keep the family together overthe womens safety and the courts would fail to prosecute the cases
10369,Starting in thes a movement began to bring attention to the profoundly destructive effect ofdomestic violence and wife battering
10370,Shelters for battered women were set up newlaws were written and police clergy and other authorities were educated about theseriousness of the problem
10371,Feminist writers were the first to describe in detail the psychological physicaleconomic and cultural aspects of wife battering and to insist on bringing public attention to the problem
10372,But as the feminist movement was essentially a political movement the approach to domestic violence emphasized the political roots of the wife battering
10373,More specifically wife battering was seen as an outgrowth of the larger societaloppression of women
10374,In a patriarchal male dominated society women were seen asproperty and wife battering a quasilegitimate means to keep women under control
10375,There is greater emphasis on empiricalresearch instead of openended interviews and clinical histories
10376,There is also interestin samesex violence the impact of domestic violence on children the psychologicalfeatures of anyone engaging in intimate partner violence and the role of femaleinitiated violence
10377,Although classic instancesof wife battering certainly do occur women themselves are not always helpless victims Handy Psychology     PM  Page of an abusive partner
10378,Sometimes women are violent themselves andor display some of the psychologically abusive tactics of a classic batterer
10379,Additionally violencebetween samesex couples cannot easily be explained by societal oppression of women
10380,Regardless of the gender ofthe people involved a battering relationship has specific psychological characteristics that have longlasting and very destructive effects on anyone caught in it
10381,Threeimportant concepts include the cycle of violence coercive control and traumaticbonding
10382,In aninfluential book entitled The Battered Woman published in  she introduced theconcept of the cycle of violence to describe a consistent pattern in the violent behavior of batterers
10383,Based on indepth interviews with battered women Walker describedthree phases of the cycle of violence the tensionbuilding phase  the acute battering incident and the honeymoon phase
10384,There may be verbal abusetemper explosions at minor frustrationsand an unpredictable building of tension
10385,There can be punching kicking hitting with objects and throwing down stairs
10386,In the honeymoon phase the batterer expresses remorse promisesto change and works hard to win back the womans love
10387,Alternatively he maythreaten suicide if she wants to leave or try to woo her back with heightened affection gifts and romantic attention
10388,While Walkers theory has been quite influential in the study andtreatment of domestic violence it has also been criticized as overly simplistic andnot applicable to all cases of domestic violence
10389,Nonetheless most clinicians wouldagree that it is descriptive of some cases of domestic violence
10390,Starks ideas about coercive control were not new in fact they dated back to the s
10391,But after thirty years of working with battered womenStark felt that the field of domestic violence had abandoned its feminist roots for anoverly narrow focus on physical violence
10392,In his view it is the psychological aspects ofthe battering relationship that are the most damaging
10393,Coercive control refers to the systematic attempts to psychologically dominate the battered women
10394,Stark felt thatthis is at the core of all battering relationships
10395,dress personal appearance diet paranoid levels of possessiveness suspiciousness and sexual jealousy verbal abuse andname calling unpredictable outbursts over minor or even imaginary infractions isolating the battered woman from all sources of social support and continuous low levels of physical aggression e
10396,The violence does not stand on its own it is part of a larger program to break downthe victim and to effectively hold her hostage
10397,Political prisoners cult members and young girls seasoned into prostitutionare frequently exposed to tactics of coercive control
10398,The goal is always the same tobreak down the selfconfidence and autonomous sense of self of the victims and leavethem at the psychological mercy of their captors
10399,A group callingthemselves the Symbionese Liberation Army took responsibility for thecrime
10400,For months Patty was lockedin a closet beaten and raped
10401,Prosecutors arguedthat she had willingly engaged incriminal behavior because she hadfailed to escape her abductors eventhough she had ample opportunitiesto do so
10402,After only  months in prison her sentence was commuted by PresidentJimmy Carter
10403,Hearst went so far as to commit armedrobbery in  at the behest of her kidnappersShutterstock
10404,Her chapter on the effects of captivity has particular relevance to thediscussion of domestic violence
10405,In a severe battering situation the batterer holds the victim captive
10406,By controlling the victims entire worldtheir sleepwake cycle their diet their physical safetyand most importantly their access to other peoplebatterers can gradually take overtheir victims mind
10407,Through constant verbal abuse and through the degradation ofthe physical abuse the victim loses any sense of selfworth
10408,Her confidence in her ability to control her environment is shattered
10409,Moreover by keeping other people away batterers remove any outside reality check on their distorted worldview
10410,A particularly powerful way to break down victims sense of self is to make them betray their own moral values
10411,The victim may be forced to engage in emotionally disturbing sexual behavior or to participate in the abuse of another victim
10412,Similar techniques are used in the brainwashing or breaking down of prisoners or cult members
10413,Acritical implication of this work is that under the right circumstances anyone can suffer the same psychological effects
10414,Of course certain people are more vulnerable to abusive relationships than others
10415,People with a history of child abuse or domestic violence in childhood may be more vulnerable to entering into and staying in a battering relationship
10416,Similarly younger people and people with significant psychological problems may also be more vulnerable
10417,For example soldiers in battleoften form lifelong ties to other soldiers in their unit
10418,Because of the acute trauma ofthe battering relationship the victim also feels an intensified need for social bonds
10419,But because of the victims social isolation they have no one to turn to besides theirbatterers
10420,First there are often practical reasonssuch as legal economic financial and cultural considerations
10421,Secondly they havegood reason to fear for their safety and even their life if they leave
10422,Thirdly the psychological effects of the battering relationship serve to break down selfconfidence tothe point that it can feel impossible to leave
10423,Inadequate financialmeans inadequate legal protection and lack of support by family andor clergy can allhinder a battered womans escape
10424,Although there is now much greater public awarenessof domestic violence than there was in previous decades battered women still may nothave the resources or support they need to survive on their own particularly if they havechildren
10425,In  her livein compan ion Joel Steinberg was convicted of manslaughter in the childs death
10426,InitiallyNussbaum was also charged in her death given her failure to take action to protect her daughter
10427,Eventually the court agreed that years of physical sexual and psychological torture rendered Nussbaum both psychologically and physically incapable oftaking action against him even to save her childs life
10428,Batterers often threaten to kill the woman or to harm her family ifshe leaves
10429,Murder by an intimate partner is the most commonform of female homicide and the point of separation is a particularly dangerous time
10430,The verbal abuse terror unpredictability and enforced social isolation all powerfullyserve to crush a victims sense of self and even her sense of reality
10431,A psychologicallybroken woman may not feel she is capable of living without her batterer
10432,Childrenexperience similar forms of psychological damage from witnessing domestic violenceas they do from being a victim of it
10433,Both child victims and child witnesses of physicalabuse report higher levels of depression aggression problems in relationships andproblems in school
10434,Do only men batter Early feminist scholars insisted that spousal battery was an overwhelmingly male phenomenon
10435,Simpsona popular former football player andNicoles estranged husband wasarrested for the murders after a dramatic televised car chase
10436,There wasa documented history of domesticviolence in the Simpson family withpolice records of multiple  callsmade by Nicole during O
10437,There were also graphicphotographs of Nicoles bruised facetaken years before the murder
10438,His attorney JohnnyCochran skillfully turned the jurys focus from the guilt or innocence of O
10439,Simpson to the credibility of the Los Angeles Police Department
10440,Simpson waslater found guilty in a wrongful death civil suit
10441,After the trial considerablemedia attention was given to the ongoing racial divisions in the United Statesrevealed by public response to this interracial scandal
10442,Unfortunately this highly publicized case brought little attention to the problem of domestic violence
10443,Simpson right with attorney Robert Shapiro during his August  trial AP PhotoNick Ut Pool
10444,In a  study of  college students Rosemarie Cogan and Tiffany Fennell found that  percent of women and  percent of men reported committing physical aggression toward an intimate partner
10445,In a  study by SusanOLeary and Amy Slep  cohabitating couples with young children reported similarresults
10446,Additionally both males andfemales perceive femaleinitiated violence to be less dangerous and problematic thanmaleinitiated violence
10447,Men are far more likely to be involved in criminal assaults against a partner than arewomen and female homicide by an intimate partner is far more common than theHandy Psychology     PM  Page THE PSYCHOLOGY OF TRAUMA reverse
10448,In fact murder by an intimate partner is the most frequent form of female homicide
10449,Taken together these findings suggest that American women are equally ifnot more likely than men to engage in mild to moderate aggression but that men arestill much more likely to engage in serious and lifethreatening violence against theirintimate partners
10450,percent of men reported an assault by an intimate partner to the police peryear
10451,Further in   women and  men were murdered by intimate partners
10452,times more likelythan men to be murdered by an intimate partner and
10453,The good news though is that the incidence of allviolent crimes by intimate partners has decreased dramatically over the last few decades
10454,Does the rate of domestic violence vary across cultures Rates of domestic violence particularly violence against women appear to vary drastically across cultures
10455,According to a  report by the World Health Organization the lifetime rate of spousal battery among everpartnered women ranged from  to  percent
10456,Rural areas had much higher rates of spousal abuse than urban areas
10457,The lifetime rate ofsexual or physical violence from an intimate partner was  percent in rural Ethiopia percent in rural Peru and  percent in rural Bangladesh
10458,The rate was  percent inurban Japan  percent in urban Serbia and Montenegro and  percent in urban Brazil
10459,Although the annual rate of spousal abuse was much lower than the lifetime rate abusewas rarely a onetime thing
10460,If it happened once it was likely to occur again
10461,Additionally alcohol abuse and exposure to domestic violence as achild both increase the likelihood of domestic violence
10462,While women now make up almost half the workHandy Psychology     PM  Page force in the United States and account for about  percent of law medical and doc toral degrees only thirtyfive years ago women accounted for a small fraction of theprofessions
10463,State Departments  report on internationalhuman rights the movement toward equal rights for women in the developing worldis only just beginning
10464,In many Islamic countries for example the role of women is still extremely con stricted and religious conservatives believe that women should be entirely subordinateto men
10465,In mostdeveloped Western countries women have essentially the same legal rights as men
10466,Inother countries many things are forbidden to women the legal right to work to haveaccess to credit to own property to initiate a divorce to have custody of the childrenand even to have ones testimony in court carry as much weight as a mans testimony
10467,Insome developing countries such as South Africa new progressive laws support manyrights for women
10468,In other countries such as Saudi Arabia women are not allowed to drive or to travel without a man accompanying them
10469,Most industrialized countries now recognize the problemand have laws against it
10470,For example in Canada there were  shelters for batteredwomen by
10471,In other developing countries such as South Africa there are lawsprohibiting domestic violence but enforcement is a problem and there is little government support for public education against domestic violence or for shelters for battered women
10472,Still other countries such as Bulgaria or Zimbabwe have no lawsagainst domestic violence
10473,In many cultures popular attitudes promote a tolerance ofdomestic violence
10474,The problem is minimized by the family and community as well asby judicial and medical systems and both men and women believe a man has the rightto physically discipline his wife
10475,Forensic psychology is a relatively new field but it is growing rapidly
10476,Forensic psychologists are involved with many aspects of both civil and criminal law
10477,In mattersof civil law they are involved with competency and disability evaluations as well asdivorce mediation and custody evaluations
10478,In criminal cases they perform evaluations of the mental state of the defendant particularly in insanity pleas and provideexpert testimony on relevant psychological factors
10479,Forensic psychologists may also provide psychotherapy for prison inmates including specific programs for violent or sexual offenders
10480,They screen applicants for the police force and canprovide stress management grief work and trauma counseling to police officers andother members of law enforcement
10481,Finally forensic psychologists perform scientificresearch on such topics as the reliability of childrens testimony recidivism of sexoffenders impulsivity and aggression and juvenile delinquency
10482,Over the past thirtyyears or so criminal profiling has become very popular in law enforcement and is now awidespread practice in many different countries
10483,There is even debate among researchers whether criminal profiling can even be scientifically validated if appropriate research were done
10484,While we know that many environmental factorsincluding poverty neighborhood crime rates social norms and lackof opportunities for legal employmentcontribute to the incidence of criminal behaviorpsychological factors also play an integral role in the choice to commit criminal acts
10485,Is there a criminal mind For quite a few decades the mental health field has attempted to classify and study thepersonality traits of people most likely to engage in criminal behavior
10486,In other wordsthey have tried to diagnose the criminal mind
10487,According to DSMIV a person with this disorder demonstrates a pervasive pattern of disregard for the rights ofothers as evidenced by at least three of the following criteria repeatedly engaging inillegal behavior frequently lying using aliases or conning others for personal profitimpulsivity and lack of future planning irritability and aggressiveness reckless disre Handy Psychology     PM  Page gard for the safety of self and others consistent irresponsibility with repeated failures to sustain employment or fulfill financial obligations lack of remorse as evident inindifference to or rationalization of hurting mistreating or stealing from others
10488,While diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder is heavilydependent on a record of criminal behavior psychopathy is more geared to the actualpersonality traits associated with criminal behavior
10489,Such traits include callousnesssuperficial and shallow emotion lack of empathy irresponsibility lack of remorse orguilt about harming others and the tendency to exploit manipulate and engage inpredatory behavior toward others
10490,Psychopathic prisoners commit more serious and violent crimes than nonpsy chopathic prisoners
10491,They are also more likely to recidivate commit another crimeafter they are released from prison
10492,Moreover psychopaths are more likely to commit FORENSIC PSYCHOLOGY Do Mafia bosses have abnormal psychological traits Would they be diagnosed with either antisocial personality disorder or psychopathy the personality disorders characterized by criminal behavior Their criminal behavior would certainly meet some cr iteria for both antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy but the fact that they operate within a subculture distinguishes them fromthe kinds of criminals that act alone
10493,Within the culture of organized crime they would probably not be considered psychologic ally abnormal Library of Congress
10494,In Michael Woodworth and Stephen Porters  study of  prisoners convicted of homicide the thirtyfour psychopathic prisoners were much more likely than the ninetyone nonpsychopathic prisoners to have committed premeditated murders
10495,He has developed an intensive interview to measure psychopathy named the Hare Psychopathy Checklist
10496,His first version was published in  and the revised version PCLR in
10497,The PCLR is a twentyitem clinical rating scale that is scored based on information from a semistructured interview and available legal files and medical records
10498,Although the maximum possible score is  the average scores in both male and female offender populations rangefrom about  to
10499,Hare uses a cutoff score of  to distinguish psychopaths from nonpsychopaths
10500,He believes that psychopathy is more of a category than a dimension
10501,Thismeans that someone either is or is not a psychopath
10502,Notably some other researchersdisagree and believe that psychopathic traits fall on a continuum
10503,Hare also estimates that psychopaths make up about one percent of thegeneral population
10504,Thus psychopathy appears to be a more severe disorder than antisocial personality disorder but fortunately a less common one
10505,Factor analysis identifies scale items that cluster together and is used to create subscales of a measure
10506,Two factors were identifiedthe interpersonalaffective factor factor  and the socially deviant lifestyle factor factor
10507,In  Hare modified his original model with a new factor model
10508,Factor was divided into an interpersonal factor impression management grandiosity pathological lying and manipulativeness and an affective factor lack of remorse shallowaffect callouslacking empathy and failure to acknowledge responsibility
10509,Factor was divided into a lifestyle factor stimulation seeking parasitic lacking goals impulsive and irresponsible and an antisocial factor aggressive early behavior problemsserious criminal behavior engagement in different types of crimes
10510,Other authorshave proposed a factor model dividing Factor  as Hare did but keeping Factor  asa behavioral factor
10511,Over the years new instruments similar to the Hare PCLR havebeen developed and have yielded similar factor structures
10512,This research suggests that psychopathy is made up of two relatively distinctpersonality traits antisocial attitudes and antisocial behavior
10513,These traits may have different causes differ in their underlying neurobiology and predict to different types of behavior
10514,Factor  is correlated with measures of narcissistic and histrionic personalitydisorder and Machiavellian traits
10515,Factor  is also correlated with level of violencerisk of recidivism repeat crimes and abnormal emotional processing low anxietylow empathy
10516,Factor  is not correlated with age education or socioeconomic status SES
10517,Factor  is correlatedwith measures of substance abuse criminal behaviors and antisocial personality disorder
10518,It is also negatively correlated with IQ education SES and age
10519,Handsome educated and intelligent he was actively involved in politics and on close terms with the Washington state governor
10520,Eventually he admitted tomurdering  women but it is likely there were many more victims
10521,He would often approachwomen wearing a sling a leg cast or crutches and ask them to help him carryhis belongings
10522,Clearly his murders were planned and calculated and not at allthe result of impulsive outbursts
10523,The dramatic split between his polished publicimage and his murderous rampages speaks to the callous sadistic manipulativeand emotionally disconnected personality traits of a classic psychopath
10524,Handy Psychology     PM  Page people with low SES education and IQ are more likely to engage in antisocial behav ior
10525,This also means that as people get older their antisocial behavior decreases
10526,And the DSMIV definition of narcissistic personalitydisorders lists grandiosity lack of empathy and the expectation that others willaccommodate to the individuals desires as criteria for the disorder
10527,Other people simplydo not matter they are solely means to an end
10528,In narcissism on the other handthere is often a strong emphasis on interpersonal relationships along with greatdependence on others approval and validation
10529,Narcissists may be selfobsessed butthey are not necessarily cold cruel or sadistic
10530,Nonetheless under the proper conditions highly narcissistic people can veer into criminal behavior
10531,The desire for richesfame and power along with the grandiose belief of being above the limits of normalpeople can lead such individuals to cross over legal and ethical lines
10532,Therefore theability to reason through situations is a critical component of behavioral control
10533,Thisentails the ability to consider alternative explanations of events and alternative solutions to problems
10534,Most importantly one must be able to anticipate future consequences
10535,It is worth noting that reduced cognitive abilities are related to behavioral problems as measured by Hares Factor
10536,Less is known about the relationship between cognitive function and the core psy chopathic personality traits of Hares Factor
10537,Certainly there have been very brilliant psychopaths throughout history and many have risen to positions of great power
10538,Suchpeople are not impulsive and are very capable of planning ahead
10539,Nonetheless there issome evidence of subtle cognitive abnormalities in psychopaths specifically with regardto attention
10540,Several studies have revealed overfocused attention in psychopaths theyonly attend to their goal and are relatively unresponsive to peripheral information

10545,Lay along with executive JeffreySkilling and his protg Andrew Fastow were all convicted of fraud andsentenced to prison
10546,Were these men typical psy chopaths Would they meet criteriafor antisocial personality disorderAlthough we can only guess outside of an inperson clinical interview it is morelikely that all three men fell victim to their own narcissism
10547,Seduced by thepower wealth and glory of their enormous success they chose to keep theirprofits growing even if they had to cross ethical and legal lines in the process
10548,The life savings of thousands of Enron employees became less important thantheir own ambition
10549,We can also question the societal values that place such priority on financial success ultimately encouraging the kind of financial misbehavior uncovered in the Enron scandal
10550,While the greed of some corporate titans might seem psychopathic it is unlikely they would meet the full criteria forantisocial personalitry disorder  iStock
10551,FORENSIC PSYCHOLOGY Do criminals age out There is clear evidence that criminals tend to age out
10552,Most serious and violent crimes are committed by people under the age of forty
10553,According to Cathy Widom andMichael Maxfield the core age for criminal behavior is from twenty to twentyfive
10554,Thus there is a general reduction ofimpulsiveaggressive and reckless behavior as people get older
10555,This reduction mayalso relate to the fact that older people have less energy and physical vigor thanyounger people
10556,Research points toa multitude of risk factors including genetic cognitive personality family and community influences
10557,It is no coincidence that most of the people in jail for violent crimes comefrom lower socioeconomic levels and disadvantaged communities
10558,Even though weare continually learning more about the biological and genetic contributions to antisocial behavior it is critical to keep in mind that environment greatly shapes allaspects of human behavior
10559,We now know muchmore about the brain areas involved in antisocial behavior the kinds of biological conditions that contribute to antisocial behavior and even genes that raise the risk ofantisocial behavior
10560,Our genes prime us toward certain personality traits and psychological abilities for example intelligence verbal skills risk tolerance
10561,In effectour genes set the parameters or the outer limits of our mental capacities
10562,Our environment then determines whether we will meet our potential or fall below it
10563,Poverty poor education inadequate community institutions lack of appropriatesocial support systems antisocial peers and dangerous and violent neighborhoods canall have a devastating effect on an adolescents social and psychological development
10564,Together these factors greatly raise the risk of the child growing up to engage incriminal behavior
10565,In a  study Magda StouthamerLoeber and colleagues examined risk and pro tective factors for severe and persistent delinquency over a sixyear period in a sampleof  boys
10566,In particular they looked at the impact of the general socioeconomic status SES of the neighborhood
10567,Neighborhood SES was based on information from the census including data on median household income number of singleparentfamilies and percentage of families below the poverty line
10568,Neighborhoods were divided into four groups high medium and low SES and low SES with the majority ofresidents in public housing
10569,In the boys aged thirteen to nineteen there was a clearrelationship between neighborhood SES and criminal behavior
10570,percent of the low SESpublic housing groupengaged in serious delinquent behavior
10571,In other words boys from the lowest SESneighborhood were almost four times more likely to engage in serious delinquentbehavior than boys from the highest SES neighborhood
10572,In othercases people join violent social groups not out of free choice but because of coercionfrom the particular group or a perceived need for protection from other violentpredatory groups
10573,Ina  study by Cathy Widom and Michael Maxfield there was a
10574,male to femaleratio for any arrest among a sample of  young adults
10575,In FBI statistics for  women accounted for percent of all arrests  percent of convicted violent felons  percent of propertyfelons and  percent of drug felons
10576,Finally female antisocial behavior may be more strongly linked to trauma and abuse
10577,For example in a Widom and Maxfields study abused women were  percentmore likely to commit a violent crime than nonabused women while the rate of violent crime only increased by  percent for abused men vs
10578,We can  Teen gangs are typically wellstructured social groups with clear codes of acceptable behavior
10579,In other words it is likely that gang members become violent because they hav e been socialized to become that way in the gang  iStock
10580,Does child abuse cause antisocial traits There is considerable evidence that a history of child abuse increases the likelihood ofcriminal activity in adolescence and adulthood
10581,percent of the abusedneglected group had arrestsas a juvenile compared to
10582,Thus abused children were about  percent more likely to be arrested as a juvenile and percent more likely to be arrested as an adult than nonabused children
10583,Do all abused children develop antisocial traits It is important to stress that the majority of abused children do not grow up to develop antisocial traits
10584,According to some estimates in fact as much as onethird ofabused children grow up without significant psychological damage
10585,Poor cognitive and language ability problematic and irritable temperamentpoor selfcontrol and selfregulation low selfesteem and inadequate social and interpersonal skills can all raise the risk of an individual engaging in criminal behavior
10586,Moreover a number of genes have been identified that are associated with reckless poorly controlled behavior
10587,Finally biologically based mental conditions such as attention deficit disorder and various learning disorders also interferewith behavioral control and raise the risk of criminal behavior
10588,In other words the emotional parts of the brains do not react as strongly to emotional stimulias the same parts of the brain in healthy people and even in nonpsychopathic prisoners
10589,Compared to nonpsychopathic criminals they are lessable to identify emotions as expressed in vocal tone facial expression or spoken sentences
10590,Also the two halvesof their cortex the left and right hemispheres are not well coordinated during cognitive tasks and the left hemisphere may be less active than is typical for most people
10591,This suggests that the emotional processes of the right hemisphere are not well coordinated with the verbal processes of the left hemisphere
10592,This difficulty making senseof emotion may relate to the lack of empathy that is characteristic of psychopaths
10593,We know that people with high levels of impulsivity and impulsive aggression have lessactivation in their orbital frontal region
10594,Handy Psychology     PM  Page the eye sockets and is associated with behavioral control
10595,Some researchers suggest that the orbital frontal cortex links planned behavior with memories of punishment
10596,In other words the person is more likely to reason Oh oh if I hit this person Imight get hit back
10597,There is also evidence of decreased function in the dorsolateral frontal cortex in impulsive aggression
10598,This area is involved in abstract and complex thought abilitiesthat are often compromised in impulsiveaggressive people
10599,The neurotransmitter serotonin also seems tobe involved in behavioral control
10600,In an important  study by John Gottman and colleagues  wife battererswere divided into two groups according to their heart rate during disagreementswith their wives
10601,In other words the firstgroup became less aroused during the disagreement rather than more aroused
10602,Further more of these men had ahistory of violence outside the family and of witnessing domestic violence aschildren
10603,Finally they scored higher on measures of antisocial and aggressivesadistic personality disorder than the highheartrate men
10604,In sum the lowheartrate batterers looked more typically psychopathic while the highheartrate batterers looked more impulsiveaggressive

10606,Is there a genetic basis for antisocial traits There is growing evidence of a genetic basis for antisocial traits
10607,In a  twin study byMats Forman and colleagues all  twins born in Sweden from  wereadministered the Youth Psychopathic Traits Inventory
10608,By comparing correlationsbetween identical and fraternal twins the authors concluded that psychopathic traitshave a strong genetic basis and that this is especially true for the impulsiveirresponsiblesubscale versus the grandiosemanipulative and callousunemotional subscales
10609,Someauthors estimate that genetics account for  to  percent of antisocial behavior
10610,A variant of this gene reduces MAOA enzyme activity and is more common in antisocialindividuals than in controls
10611,Another gene calledGA is related to the HTA subtype of the serotoninsystem
10612,The othervariant known as the Aallelle is associated with lower levels of rule breakingand incidentally lower levels of popularity with peers
10613,In other words boys withthe Gallele were both bigger rule breakers and more popular
10614,Because of the criminal nature of the drug industry competition between rival drug dealers is often a horriblyviolent affair resulting in countless drugrelated deaths
10615,Someanalysts believe that drugs should be made legal in order toreduce crime
10616,For one drug addiction can destroy an addicted individuals abilityto hold a job removing the means to pay for the drug
10617,In this situation drug addictsmay turn to crime in order to obtain the money needed to pay for their drug
10618,Commonforms of criminal activity include robbery drug dealing and prostitution
10619,In fact it has been estimated that  percent of caraccidents and more than  percent of murders involve alcohol intoxication
10620,Thirdlymost Western countries outlaw the most common drugs of abuse
10621,Consequently the market for illicit drugs goesunderground and becomes the domain of criminals
10622,Competition within the illicit drugtrade has led to a tremendous amount of violence dating back many decades
10623,It is no surprise then to find thaton average violent criminals have many of the characteristics associated with impulsive aggression
10624,They are largely male young have problems regulating their aggression and tend to have lower IQs less education and lower SES than the general population
10625,They are also more likely to have childhood histories of physical abuse andneglect
10626,Cognitively they have difficulty anticipating the consequences of theiractions and tend toward a narrow rigid and essentially paranoid interpretation ofothers intentions
10627,Ambiguous gestures are interpreted as threatening and hostile setting off a hairtrigger aggressive reaction
10628,Nonimpulsive violent criminals are morelikely to have psychopathic traits that is they have the callous exploitive andunemotional traits of a psychopath
10629,Proportionatelyfemales are considerably more likely to be convicted of a nonviolent than a violentcrime
10630,Child molesters tend to be older than other criminals and are probably not as impulsive although there is likely a subset of highly impulsive child molesters
10631,Most childmolesters use bribery manipulation and seduction to access their victims although asizeable proportion use instrumental force that is only enough force to attain theirgoals
10632,Although there is a small fraction of highly violent child molesters the vastmajority are not violent
10633,In general the majority of child molesters have only afew victims while a small fraction with persistent pedophilic tendencies can molesthundreds or thousands of children over a lifetime
10634,In a  article RobertPrentky Raymond Knight and Austen Lee proposed several subtypes of child molesters based on their own clinical experience and the research literature
10635,The mostimportant distinction is between fixated and regressed child molesters
10636,Fixated child molesters have a longstanding sexual attraction to prepubescent children
10637,Regressed child molesters are not primarily pedophilic but turn to children for sit uational reasons
10638,They might have impulse control problems poor social skills psychopathic tendencies or a substance abuse disorder
10639,Some child molesters turn to children because they have inadequate socialskills to engage with adults
10640,Together this results in four categories high fixationlowsocial competence high fixationhigh social competence low fixationlow social competence and low fixationhigh social competence
10641,Child molesters are then further differentiated according to the amount of contact physical injury and sadism involved
10642,Are homosexual child molesters really homosexual Male offenders against boys seem to be quite different from male offenders againstgirls
10643,For one a good percentage of homosexual pedophiles also molest girls over percent in one study
10644,Child molesters are more likely to have a childhoodhistory of sexual abuse than are nonsexual offenders and even sex offenders againstolder victims
10645,Offenders against children were older more likely to havemale victims or victims of both sexes and less likely to use force or a weapon
10646,Theyalso had less invasive offenses and were less likely to have sexual intercourse withtheir victim
10647,In other words compared to adult rapists child molesters are older lessviolent and less focused on female victims
10648,In other words they are easily led torecall things that did not actually happen and then become convinced their newmemories are accurate
10649,Because of this the reliability of the testimony of children isheavily dependant on the interviewers technique
10650,Moreover FORENSIC PSYCHOLOGYHandy Psychology     PM  Page their ability to attain a position of responsibility in the first place generally speaks to bet ter impulse control planning and ability to delay gratification than is found in the typically impulsive criminal
10651,Likewise whitecollar criminals tend to be more educated andcome from a higher SES background than other criminals
10652,We can also speculate thatmany whitecollar criminals have a high degree of narcissistic traits and find the allureof the money and the status that it can bring overwhelming
10653,An inflated sense of entitlement dampens their guilt at stealing from other people
10654,Serial killers tend toact alone or with an accomplice and they generally kill strangers
10655,Importantly theykill for their own psychological gratification rather than for money power or politicalpurposes
10656,Based on the testimony of  of herthree to fiveyearold charges she was sentenced to  years in prison
10657,The childrens allegations included bizarre and highly improbable sex acts such asspreading peanut butter on their genitals and violating them with silverware andLego blocks
10658,The absence of physical signs of abuse in any of the children failedto influence the outcome
10659,Michaels spent five years in prison before her case was overturned on appeal
10660,Examination of the interviews of the children revealed highly suspect techniques
10661,Children were badgered cajoled and bribed into giving the desiredresponses
10662,The children were simply too young to understand that they werebeing pressured to say things that were not true
10663,Following cases like thisresearchers turned their attention to the various ways childrens testimony canbe distorted and corrupted
10664,Handy Psychology     PM  Page Forensic psychologists say that serial killers are motivated by the sense of absolute power over their victims and that they spend a good deal of time fantasizing about and planning their crimes
10665,Not surprisingly most serial killers are profoundlyemotionally disturbed and many report traumatic and painful childhoods
10666,In onesmall study from   percent reported a history of alcoholism in their family and percent reported psychological abuse in childhood
10667,In fact the most successful serial killers can effectivelyplan their crimes and escape capture for decades
10668,The first type is organized and has aplanful thoughtout approach to the crimes
10669,These serial killers position the bodyattempt to hide the body tamper with the evidence and take the weapon with them
10670,They use an improvised murder weapon leave the body uncovered leave a trail of clothing to the murder sceneand leave the victims belongings scattered about
10671,The two types of serial killers arealso assumed to use different modes of torture rape and murder
10672,Surprisingly this theory has had little scientific evidence to back it up
10673,In a  article David Canter and colleagues tested the organizeddisorganized classification bystudying the records of one hundred different serial killers
10674,They found that all of theserial killers were predominantly organized in their approach
10675,Disorganized features were less common but present to some degree in almost all subjects
10676,The authors suggested a new way of classifying serial killers dividing them into four new categories those concerned with mutilation execution sexual control orplunder
10677,The first type mutilates the victims body often after death
10678,The second typeexecutes their victims quickly after they are finished with them
10679,The third type sexually tortures the victims while they are alive presumably giving the killer a sense ofcomplete control over another person
10680,In a criminal setting this maymean being competent to stand trial or to participate in ones own defense
10681,On a civillevel this may mean competent to manage ones own finances make medical decisions or otherwise manage ones own affairs
10682,In other words the person must have intentionally chosen to actin a criminal way
10683,As intention is a psychological stateand one that is not always easyto provethe individuals mental state is relevant to the proof of criminal intent
10684,Both Jeffrey Dahmer andJohn Wayne Gacy are well known serial killers
10685,Dahmer was arrested in the early s and Gacy in the late s
10686,Interestingly Gacy was also an artist and painted bizarrely innocent and childlike pictures of nature scenes and of childrens cartoons such as Disneys sevendwarves
10687,The planned and organized nature of his crimes as well as the psychopathic split between respectability in public and murderous perversion in private is characteristic of serial killers
10688,Insanity is a legal term that is quite different from the clinical term
10689,In the UnitedStates the legal definition of insanityvaries from state to state
10690,Most states specify that a person must be unable to appreciatethe nature and implications of their behavior or to understand that it was morallywrong
10691,Other states include the inability to resist ones impulses is the definition ofinsanity
10692,Under federal law an insane personcannot appreciate the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of the criminal acts
10693,The person is not excused from criminal liability due to insanity but the courtrecognizes that mental illness played a role in the crime
10694,Defendants with a guilty butmentally ill verdict are typically remanded to a psychiatric facility or provided withpsychiatric treatment while in prison

10699,From thetime he returned home he was unresponsive to human interaction
10700,Throughout hischildhood he was extremely shy and painfully averse to human contact especiallywith strangers and other children

10711,He moved in there alone and became increasingly isolated even cuttingoff contact from his mother and brother
10712,As he cultivated the skills to become entirely selfsufficient in the wilderness he also developed his antitechnology ideology
10713,For years he had become disillusioned withtechnology and disgusted with human destruction of the natural world

10715,Over the next  years he sent  bombs injuring  people and killing three
10716,His brotherDavid recognized Kaczynskis writings from the manifesto and eventually contactedthe FBI
10717,His defense attorneys entered an insanityplea and a courtappointed psychiatrist diagnosed him with paranoid schizophrenia
10718,Kaczynski vigorously rejected this diagnosis as he did not want his political missionto be dismissed as the rantings of a psychotic man
10719,He plead guilty and was sentencedto life imprisonment without parole but was spared the death penalty because of hisbrothers intervention
10720,Was Kaczynski insane He almost certainly had a diagnosable psychiatric disorder of some kind
10721,Whether or not he was mentally ill he clearly hadcriminal intent
10722,In this case the defendant is found guilty of the crime but evidence of mental disturbance is taken into account during sentencing
10723,The burden of proof in these cases ismuch lower than in an insanity defense
10724,For example on average violent felons have reduced functioning in the frontal lobe and psychopathic prisoners have underresponsive amygdalas

10728,With  separate personality disorder diagnoses in the fourthedition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSMIV personality disorders are recognized as valid psychiatric conditions
10729,Does the presence ofa personality disorder remove culpability for criminal behavior This is especially ofconcern given that some personality disorders are associated with or even defined byantisocial behavior
10730,The problem is more one of motivation and disturbedinterpersonal relations
10731,Therefore there is no reason that a personality disorder wouldleave someone incapable of forming criminal intent
