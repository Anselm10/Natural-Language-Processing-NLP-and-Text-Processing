viHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page viI have been fascinated with psychology ever since I was a child. I wanted to understand
what made people do what they do, what the story was behind their behavior. I wantedto strip back the outer cover and see the machinery within. Many years later, I am stillfascinated with psychology. Psychology is ultimately the foundation of all humanendeavor. Why do we think, feel, and act the way we do? Why do we love, hate, eat,work, or dance the way we do? How does our three-pound brain produce the incredi-ble intricacies of human behavior? How much of our psychology is due to genes andhow much to our environment? These questions are addressed every day in thousandsof laboratories and consulting rooms across the country and across the world. And theanswers to such age-old questions are closer at hand than at any point in history.While I do not believe we will ever fully understand the extraordinary mystery of thehuman mind, we certainly can learn—and have learned—a tremendous amount
about our mental processes. Moreover, such discoveries can help reduce the sufferingand improve the lives of millions of people.
Interestingly, the major players in the field of psychology used to be far better
known to the general public. Fifty years ago, the average person on the street wasmore likely to be familiar with the likes of Sigmund Freud, B.F . Skinner, or JeanPiaget. There was a widespread appreciation of the importance of the field of psycholo-gy and its relevance to everyday life. In contemporary times, there is far less generalawareness of the contributions of the field of psychology. Perhaps psychology—that is,the scientific discipline of psychology—has been a victim of its own success. Certainly
talk shows and magazines are filled with psychological topics. Dr. Phil, Dr. Laura, andDr. Joyce Brothers remain household names. But I would suggest that the entertain-ment value of popular psychology has overtaken the appreciation of serious science.
Meanwhile, psychology is flourishing within the walls of academia. Psychology
remains an incredibly popular major in college and graduate school. But within theuniversity, the seriousness of the field has overtaken its inherent entertainment value.Thus psychology has split into two vectors: popular psychology, which is entertaining
viiIntroductionHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page viibut not rigorous, and academic psychology, which is serious but not easily accessible
to the non-specialist.
This book is intended to find a middle ground, to provide a rigorous and scientifi-
cally grounded book that is nonetheless accessible and engaging to the general public.
The first section of this book gives an overview of the fundamentals of psychology.
We cover the history and pioneers of psychology, the major theoretical movements, thescience of psychology, the brain and its relationship to behavior, and psychologicaldevelopment across the lifespan. These are the areas traditionally covered in textbooks.
In the second half of the book we address how the scientific methods of psycholo-
gy have been applied to questions of everyday life. Here we see how the science of psy-chology has immediate relevance to a broad spectrum of human activities. What canpsychology tell us about love, marriage, family, and sexuality? What can psychologytell us about happiness or our relationship with money? Chapter 7 explores the psy-chology of the group and how group dynamics play out in the work place, the publicsphere, and in the problems of prejudice and racism. Chapters 8 through 10 look atabnormal psychology. Chapter 8 addresses clinical psychology, covering such topics aspsychopathology, psychiatric diagnosis, psychotherapy, and psychiatric medication.Chapter 9 looks at the psychology of trauma, and chapter 10 at forensic psychology,where psychology intersects the law.
As part of the “Handy Answer Book” series, this book is structured in a question-
and-answer format. Approximately 1,000 questions are answered with one- or two-paragraph answers. The goal is to break down complex topics into bite-size ideas.While the questions were carefully selected to create a narrative flow, this is also thekind of book that you can open at any point and browse. If you want, you can read thebook from cover to cover, but you can also flip through to find questions that particu-larly jump out at you.
Although I want the reader to feel free to jump around, the nature of science is
that it is cumulative. In other words, the most recent developments rest upon theshoulders of earlier work. Because of this, the sections in the second half of the bookwill sometimes refer to topics and people introduced in the first half. If readers runacross an unfamiliar idea, person, or issue, they can look the topic up in the index,which will then point them to other areas in the book where the issue is discussed.
I have applied the same scientific standards when writing this book that I use
when writing scientific articles for professional journals and have worked hard to onlyinclude conclusions that are supported by solid if not multiple references. In profes-sional papers, you cite your sources in the middle of the text, right where you are ref-erencing them. While this practice is necessary for scientific accuracy, it does notmake for easy reading. Therefore we put the reference list at the back of the book.Readers who are interested in learning more about any particular area can look up therelevant references for more information.
viiiHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page viiiThis book is intended for the general public. Anyone who has a passing interest in
psychology could pick up this book to learn more about the field. Did you study psy-
chology in college and always maintained an interest in it? Have you had personalexperience with psychological problems, either in yourself or in your family? Are youthinking you might like to pursue a career in the mental health field? Or do you justwonder about why people behave the way they do? Then The Handy PsychologyAnswer Book is for you.
Although this book is intended for the general public, it can also be used to sup-
plement traditional textbooks. If you want a quick review on Attachment Theory or onBehaviorism, if you want to remind yourself of the basics of brain-behavior relation-ships, or if you want a quick introduction to key psychological theories, this book canbe helpful for you.
Whatever your reasons for picking up this book, I hope that you can put it down
with a better appreciation of just how fascinating psychology can be and how impor-tant it is to everyday life.

THE BASICS
THE BASICS
What is psychology ?
Psychology involves the systematic study of mind and behavior. This extremely broad
domain includes questions of motivation and information processing, normal andabnormal behavior, mental health and mental illness, the individual and the group,and people functioning in the context of their lives.
How does psychology relate to everyday life?
Psychology relates to every part of everyday life. The questions of psychology relate tohow and why we love and suffer and desire, how we raise our children, how and why wesucceed or fail at work. Psychology also relates to why we are so fascinated with celebri-ties and why their marriages so often fail. While the science of psychology may seemabstract at times, the implications touch every arena in which people think, feel or act.
How does psychology interact with biology and sociology?
The human mind does not function in isolation. It exists within both a biological anda social context. Therefore psychology serves as an interface between biology, specifi-cally the biology of the brain, and sociology, the study of the behavior of groups.
What do psychologists do?
Psychology is a remarkably varied field, involving both the performance of scientificresearch and the application of its findings. Psychologists work as scientists, clini-
1Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 1cians, teachers, authors, consultants, and evaluators. They perform empirical
research, provide therapy and assessment, and evaluate mental status or disability innumerous settings, such as the government, schools and the judicial system. Psychol-ogists also consult on wide-ranging problems for businesses, schools, the military, thepolice force, sports teams and even rock bands. As the study of human behavior, psy-chology is can potentially apply to any field of human endeavor.
What is the difference between psychologists and psychiatrists?
The responsibilities of psychologists and psychiatrists often overlap; both psycholo-gists and psychiatrists can diagnose and evaluate mental illness, provide psychothera-py, and conduct research. Nonetheless, their background and training differ consider-ably. In general, psychologists are students of the mind and behavior whilepsychiatrists are experts in mental illness. Psychologists are trained in academia andtheir highest degree is the doctorate (Ph.D. or Psy.D.) in psychology. They do not pre-scribe medicine, unless they are certified by the few states that have prescription privi-leges for psychologists. Moreover, not all psychologists are involved with clinical work.In contrast, psychiatrists are trained in the medical field. They are all physicians, hav-ing completed medical school and having obtained an M.D. (or D.O.). Their training isalmost entirely clinical and focuses on the evaluation and pharmacological treatment(i.e., medication) of severe mental illness.
What are the divisions of the American Psychological Association?
The APA is divided into the following interest groups, known as divisions.
1. General Psychology
2. Teaching of Psychology3. Experimental Psychology5. Evaluation, Measurement, and Statistics6. Behavioral Neuroscience and Comparative Psychology
2What is the major professional association
of American psychologists?
The American Psychological Association (APA) was founded in 1892 and has
150,000 members. There are 53 Divisions covering the wide range of activi-
ties within the field. The APA is the oldest and largest psychological associationin the world.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 27. Developmental Psychology

PSYCHOLOGY
BEFORE PSYCHOLOGY
When was the field of psychology established?
The study of mental processes as a science is relatively new as it is dependent on
the scientific revolution. Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920) is credited with first estab-lishing psychology as an independent science. He opened the first scientific labora-tory to study psychology in 1879 at the University of Leipzig. Wundt was interestedin investigating human consciousness through systematic introspection; collabora-tors would be trained to report their own sensory experience in response to physi-cal stimulation.
What came before psychology?
Modern psychology is a child of the scientific revolution. Without the systematicapplication of reason and observation that forms the foundation of the scientificmethod, there would be no modern psychology. Nonetheless, contemporary psycholo-gy is not without precedents, and within Western history there are many precursors,ancestors so to speak, of psychology as we know it today. Ancient Greek philosophy,medieval Christianity, and post-Renaissance philosophers of the past several centuriesall addressed the core questions of psychology in ways that both differed from andanticipated much of what we know today.
What did the ancient Greeks have to say about psychology?
Twenty-five hundred years ago, ancient Greek philosophers turned their remarkablysophisticated inquiries away from the whims of the gods and toward questions of thenatural world. Questions about humanity’s place in the world naturally followed. Whatis knowledge and how do we gain it? What is our relationship with emotions? Whilesome of their answers to these questions appear bizarre by modern standards, much ofit remains strikingly current.
4Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 4What is the Greek root of the word “psychology”?
The word psychology derives from the Greek words psyche, meaning soul, and logos,
meaning a reasoned account in words. It is important to note, though, that the Greeks’
conception of the mind was quite different from ours. In general, the Greeks under-stood the mind in more concrete ways with less emphasis on the complexity of subjec-tive experience.
Did Homer have a Concept of the Mind?
Homer’s legendary epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey, date back to the eighth century
B.C.E. Although Homer’s epics are timeless stories of passion and drama, his under-
standing of human psychology is radically different from our view today. There is noreal concept of consciousness in Homer, no sense of the characters’ behaviors beingmotivated by their own internal feelings or thoughts. Instead characters’ motiva-tions are imposed on them through the whims of the gods. Athena makes Odysseus
do whatever he does. Abstract ideas of mental life, of consciousness, do not exist andawareness is understood in concrete, bodily terms. For example, the Greek wordnoos (later spelled nous), which later came to mean consciousness, was more con-
cretely understood as vision or sight. The word psyche, which in later years referredto the soul or the mind, in Homer’s day meant only blood or breath, the physicalmarkers of life.
When did the Greeks turn to questions of psychology?
The pre-Socratic philosophers—i.e., those who predated Socrates—lived in the earlyfifth century and sixth centuries 
B.C.E. Philosophers such as Alcmaeon, Protagoras,
Democritus, and Hippocrates introduced concepts remarkably pertinent to modernideas. Shifting focus from the gods to the natural world, they attributed mental activi-ty to nous (the later spelling of noos), which some even located in the brain. Several ofthese philosophers believed that our knowledge of the world is only learned throughthe sense organs. As we can only know what we see, hear, smell or touch, all humanknowledge is necessarily subjective and will differ from individual to individual. Thisbelief in the relativism of human knowledge is a radical idea that remains pertinent tomodern psychology.
Do all the ancient Greeks’ ideas hold up in the light of modern science?
Not all of the ancient Greeks’ ideas make sense from a contemporary point of view.Hippocrates, for example, believed that mental illness is caused by imbalancesbetween bile, phlegm, and blood and Alcmaeon believed that perceptions reached thebrain through channels of air. Nonetheless, the attempt to find biological explanationsof psychological processes is extraordinarily similar to modern views.
5INTRODUCING THE BASICSHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 5What are the four bodily humors?
Hippocrates (460–377 B.C.E.) was a brilliant physician who introduced the
notion of the four bodily humors, a concept that would influence medical
theories for almost 2,000 years. Hippocrates based his physiological theory on
the ideas of another pre-Socratic philosopher, Empedocles (c. 492–c. 432 B.C.E.),
who believed the entire world to be composed of earth, air, fire, and water. Thebodily elements of black bile, yellow bile, blood, and phlegm corresponded witheach of Empedocles’s four elements. Although Hippocrates attributed all mentalprocesses (such as joy, grief, etc.) to the brain, he believed that both mental andphysical health rested on a harmonious balance of the four bodily humors. Overfive centuries later, the Roman physician Galen (130–201 
C.E.) expanded Hip-
pocrates’s ideas to create a typology of personality. The melancholic personality(from black bile) tended toward the depressed; the choleric (from yellow bile)tended toward anger, the sanguine (from blood) tended toward the vigorous,courageous, and amorous, and the phlegmatic (from phlegm) tended to be calmand not easily perturbed. Each personality type resulted from an excess of itsrespective bodily humor. Although modern science has disproved this theory,Galen’s terms are still used to describe personality traits.
6What did Plato and Aristotle have to say about psychology?
Plato (428–347 B.C.E.) and Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.), the two most famous Greek
philosophers, have had far-reaching influence on Western thought. While neither isbest known for his psychological ideas, both have had impact on Western conceptionsof the mind. Plato believed that the truth lay in abstract concepts, or forms, that couldbe grasped through reason alone. The data we get from our senses is impermanentand therefore illusory. The notion of an inborn mental ability to grasp concepts andcategories is consistent with modern cognitive psychology and neuroscience,although the dismissal of “sense data” is not. Aristotle was much more enamored ofthe natural world and believed knowledge to come from systematic logical reasoningabout our observations of nature. He maintained that the capacity for logical reason-ing is innate but the content of our knowledge can only be grasped through our sens-es. In this way, Aristotle anticipated the foundations of modern science.
Did Plato’s ideas anticipate Freud in any way?
Plato also had ideas about emotions and emotional control that anticipated Freud’stheories of the ego and the id. Plato’s three-part division of the soul into appetite, rea-son, and temper (also known as the spirited part of the soul) has been linked to Freud’sdivision of the mind into the id, ego, and superego. Plato also believed in controllingHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 6Does life have a purpose?
Aristotle believed that everything
on Earth has a purpose, a telos.
The acorn is intended to grow intoan oak, a knife is intended to cut, abaker is intended to bake. As humanbeings are the only animals that rea-son, it is our telos to reason; it is ourpurpose. If we live according to ourpurpose, we will be living virtuouslyand will consequently be happy.
There are two types of telos:
intrinsic telos and extrinsic telos.
Intrinsic telos suggests that the aim ofthe organism is inherent in its nature,an acorn is innately programmed togrown into a tree. Extrinsic telosrefers to a purpose imposed by anexternal force, such as a deity.
Not all modern views hold that life has a purpose, however. In the Darwinian
view of natural selection, genetic variations happen by chance and persist only if
they turn out to be adaptive, if they promote the survival of the species. We rea-son not because it is our telos but because we happen to have evolved that way.
Our capacity to reason helped our species to survive.
The teleological view is more consistent with other modern views, though.
Abraham Maslow (1908–1970), the humanistic psychologist, believed that we arepredisposed to strive for a state of self-actualization , in which our personality is
fully flowered and we reach our full emotional potential. It is, in effect, our telos.
Sigmund Freud, as well, may have been influenced by teleology. He studied
with Franz Brentano, who was a scholar of Aristotle.
For Aristotle, everything has a purpose. The acorn is intended
to grow into an oak tree, for example, and people are meantto think and reason (photo: iStock).INTRODUCING THE BASICS
7the bodily passions in order to turn one’s desire toward loftier goals, as described in his
metaphor of the soul as a charioteer with a pair of winged steeds. One steed is immortallike the steeds of the gods and aspires toward contemplation of spiritual beauty. Theother steed is mortal and plunges toward earth and toward animalistic passions anddesire. The chariot must rein in the steed of animal appetites in order for the soul togain true happiness. We can link the earthly steed to the id and the charioteer to theego. More loosely, we could tie the immortal steed to the superego.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 7Did the Roman statesman Cicero have anything to add about the mind?
The Romans were better known for their practical accomplishments in the fields of
law, engineering, and warfare than for their philosophical works but some contribu-tions are worth noting. Cicero (106–42 
B.C.E.), the famous Roman orator, gave a
detailed description of the passions. He grouped the passions into four categories: dis-comfort, fear, pleasure or joy, and desire (libido in Latin). We can wonder whether
Freud’s use of the term libido was influenced by Cicero.
What happened to the Greeks’ ideas after the fall of the Roman Empire ?
The ideas of the Greek philosophers were disseminated throughout the RomanEmpire and remained influential until its fall in the fourth century 
C.E. By then Chris-
tianity was the official religion of the Roman Empire, and following the fall of Rome,the Christian church was essentially the sole surviving institution. Although manyaspects of pagan philosophical thought were integrated into church teaching (e.g.,Plato’s idea of the immortal soul), anything that did not fit with Christian theologywas considered heretical. In Christendom, meaning most of Europe, this state ofaffairs remained largely unchanged until the dawn of the modern era. Thus questionsof psychology were addressed through medievalChristianity.
How were questions of psychology seen in medieval Christianity?
In general, medieval Christianity focused more on the next world than on our happi-ness within this one. True happiness would only be found in Heaven, not on earth, and
8
It was once common in Europe for people to believe that mental illnesses were the result of possession by devils and demons. In the
Middle Ages, Satan was often blamed for most of the suffering in the world.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 8entrance to Heaven could only be found through religious piety. Free will was empha-
sized by St. Augustine (354–430 C.E.), the most influential Christian theologian in the
first millennium C.E. Every individual has the free will to choose whether or not to fol-
low God. Sex and the passions of the body were considered sinful, unless performedwithin a marriage for the purpose of childbearing. Belief in the devil was also wide-spread and mental illness was often seen as a result of possession by the devil.
What was happening in the Muslim world during the Middle Ages?
Within one century after the death of the Islamic prophet Mohammed (570–632),Muslim armies had conquered almost all of the southern and eastern Mediterranean,encompassing essentially the southern half of the former Roman Empire. In contrastto northern Europe where the advanced culture of the Greco-Roman world was large-ly lost for a millennium, the literature of the ancient scholars was preserved inmedieval Islam and several centers of learning were established across the Arab world.Avicenna (980–1031), who was known in Arabic as ibn Sina, was committed to thesynthesis of classical literature with Islamic doctrine.
Despite a traumatically peripatetic life, Avicenna succeeded in writing one of the
most influential texts in the history of medicine, known as the Canon of Medicine. Asa physician, he was very familiar with psychological illness. He endorsed the doctrineof the four humors in the tradition of Hippocrates and Galen as well as the brain’s rolein psychological disturbances. His theory about inner senses addressed the relation-ships between perception, memory, and imagination. He even speculated about whatparts of the brain control different psychological functions.
When did more modern approaches to psychology begin?
After the European Renaissance (fifteenth to sixteenth centuries) brought a seachange of cultural and intellectual values, attention was drawn away from the worldbeyond and back to this world. Philosophers started to revisit the questions asked bythe ancient Greeks and then built upon those ideas to create a new way of seeing the

How does the belief in demonic possession relate to psychology?
The idea of the devil was pervasive throughout the Middle Ages and pre-scien-tific Europe, and all manner of illness and misfortune was attributed to Satan
or lesser devils and demons. Mental illness, in particular, was seen to be causedby demonic possession. It was believed that Jesus exorcised demons, a task thatwas performed by priests by the time of the Middle Ages. Even today some peoplebelieve in demonic possession.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 9mind. While psychology per se did not exist yet, philosophy was beginning to lay the
groundwork for what would later become psychology. Philosophers of note includedRené Descartes (1596–1650), Benedict de Spinoza (1632–1677), Thomas Hobbes(1588–1679), and John Locke (1632–1704).
What was Descartes’s contribution to the history of psychology?
Fundamentally, Descartes’s contribution to psychology was to make the concept ofmind front and center of his philosophy. His famous phrase Cogito ergo sum (I think
therefore I am) links the mental function of thinking to the proof of his very exis-tence. A naturalist who carefully observed the natural world and even dissected ani-mals, he was extremely interested in the relationships between mental and bodilyprocesses. In fact, Cartesian dualism, the notion that the mind and the body are sepa-rate entities, continues to inspire debate to this day.
How did Descartes understand the workings of the brain and the
nervous system?
Influenced both by his knowledge of physiology and the hydraulic (i.e., water-based)mechanics of the day, Descartes had a complex mechanical understanding of mentaland physical processes that anticipated Freud’s own hydraulic model. Descartes wrotethat impressions of the outside world are made on our sensory organs (i.e., eyes, ears,nose) causing animal spirits (a life giving fluid filled with purified blood) to press onour brain. The brain then sends the fluid down to our body through our nerves, caus-ing muscles to expand and move. In this way critical functions like digestion, respira-tion, and even psychological processes such as sensation, the appetites and passions,take place. He also identified the pineal gland, which lies at the base of the brain, asthe site where the non-physical mind and the physical body interact.
How did Spinoza contribute to the history of psychology?
Benedict de Spinoza (1632–1677) was a sephardic Jew living in the Netherlands in theseventeenth century. Now seen as one of the first modern philosophers, he was ex-communicated in 1656 from the Jewish community for what was then consideredheretical writings. Spinoza believed our primary psychological drive to be the promo-tion and protection of our own well-being and survival, an idea that anticipated evolu-tionary psychology. He also believed our three primary emotions to be pleasure, pain,and desire, all of which signal the state of our well-being. This anticipated Freud’spleasure principle. Finally, Spinoza taught that our cognitive appraisal of any situa-tion will determine our emotional response. In other words how we think about anevent will shape how we feel about it. Therefore we can change our emotions bychanging our thoughts. This is the basic principle behind cognitive therapy, pioneeredin the mid- twentieth century by Aaron Beck and Albert Ellis.

What is folk psychology and how does it deal
with the issues of everyday life?
It was not only the philosophers who grappled with the questions of psycholo-gy. As the issues of psychology are so relevant to everyday life, we would expect
many people to come up with ideas about psychological principles. Folk psychol-ogy, often expressed in aphorisms or proverbs, captures some of these ideas asthey were passed down through the generations. Below are just some of thecommon sense sayings that people have used over the years to communicate thewisdom of folk psychology.

Memories are the residues of the initial sense
impressions, somewhat like waves that continue even after the wind ceases. He notedthat ideas get linked together in memory when the sense impressions first occur closein time. This concept of associative memory became the basis of behaviorism, a psy-
chological movement that arose in the twentieth century.
How did John Locke build on earlier ideas?
John Locke (1632–1704), who was also mostly known as a political philosopher, divid-ed ideas into two classes: sensation, our initial sense impressions; and reflection, themind’s actions on the initial sense impressions. Thus he distinguished between per-
ception and cognition. Further, he considered our complex ideas (abstract concepts
such as justice, love, whiteness) to derive from combinations of simple ideas. Thenotion that cognition develops from the simple to the complex anticipates Piaget andother twentieth- century cognitive psychologists.
PSYCHOLOGY IN
OTHER CULTURES
How have other cultures addressed psychological issues?
Psychology addresses the basic human questions about life. Why do we act the way wedo? Why do we feel what we do? Why do we suffer? Why do we love? Why do we desirewhat we desire? Modern psychology is unique in that it investigates these primordialquestions through the lens of the scientific method. Nonetheless, throughout historyand across cultures, people have grappled with these questions and come up withtheir own answers.
How is shamanism relevant to psychology?
Shamans are individuals from traditional, pre-modern societies who mediate betweentheir community and the world of the spirits. In order to travel to the domain of thespirits they enter a trance-like state, often by dancing, music, or a psycho-active plant.Shamanism is a widely spread practice, ranging from the Mongolian steppes to indige-nous people of the Americas. While shamanistic practices will vary across cultures, inall shamanistic societies, it is presumed that the world is peopled by spirits and thatproper ceremonial communion with these spirits will heal mental and physical illness,bring favorable weather conditions, regulate social harmony, etc. There is an emphasison the ecstatic trance state as a condition of personal transformation. Moreover, anindividual’s internal mental states are seen to be caused by—or at least subject to—outside forces, such as the spirits of ancestors, animals, or aspects of nature.

Eastern religions have?
By Eastern religions, we generally are
referring to the cultures of Asia. There area number of religious traditions in Asia,many going back thousands of years. Bud-dhism and Hinduism are the largest andbest known of the Eastern religions.
What tenets of Buddhism are
relevant to psychology?
One of the primary tenets in Buddhism isthat suffering comes from the illusionthat our selves are separate, individual,and complete. People who are emotional-ly attached to what Westerners might callthe ego, or to the idea of the self as a self-contained, isolated entity, are bound tosuffer. Happiness or bliss can only befound by relinquishing attachment to thelimited and mortal self in favor of theinfinite reality of which we are all a part.Meditation and other contemplative prac-tices are the best ways to access the spiri-tual knowledge that lies within all of us.
What aspects of Hinduism are relevant to psychology?
Hinduism is an ancient religion whose beginnings date back 6,000 years. Althoughthere is tremendous variation in Hinduism, there are some consistent strains. As withBuddhism, which originally derived from Hinduism, there is an emphasis on an all-encompassing, multi-dimensional spiritual unity to which we all belong. The manydeities in Hinduism are simply manifestations of this cosmic divinity. Suffering comesfrom ignorance and enlightenment comes from knowledge of the oneness of all realityand of the illusory nature of separateness and individuality. Contemplative practicesare also important in the Hindu religion.

How do the three major monotheistic religions address psychological
questions?
While there are major differences between the three monotheistic religions—Chris-tianity, Judaism, and Islam—they all believe in a single God who is the source of alltruth, morality, and happiness. Thus in all three religions, human psychology isdefined and shaped by the relationship to God. Happiness is found by getting close toGod, by submitting to or obeying Him and living according to His dictates. Likewise,suffering comes from distance from God. Christianity has a well-developed concept ofsin, which reflects a rejection of God’s path. Christianity also speaks of the devil, towhom much destructive and socially unacceptable behavior is attributed. Finally,truth is revealed by God, either through the central religious texts or through prayer.There may be variation in the interpretation of God’s truth, but His truth is absolute;there is no truth outside of it.
HISTORY AND PIONEERS
What was the scientific climate at the birth of psychology?
By the time psychology came into its own as an independent discipline, the scientificrevolution was two centuries old. Much more was known about the nervous system,the brain and the chemical and electrical processes in the body than could have beendreamed of by the earlier philosophers. The scientific method had continued to evolveand technology allowed for sophisticated instruments of measurement. Thus whenpsychology burst on the scene in the late 1800s, its proponents were eager to provethis new field as worthy a science as any other discipline.
Why is Wilhelm Wundt considered the father of psychology?
Although Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920) was not the first to address psychologicalquestions with scientific means, he was the first to establish a scientific laboratorydevoted specifically to psychology. This was done in 1879 at the University ofLeipzig. Ernst Weber (1795–1878), Hermann Helmholtz (1821–1894), and GustavFechner (1801–1887) had all made important contributions to our understanding ofsensation and perception prior to this, but none of them considered himself a psy-chologist per se. Wundt, in contrast, was specifically focused upon establishing psy-chology as a science.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 14What is phrenology?
Not all of the early forays into
psychology were based on solid
science. Phrenology was started by
Franz Joseph Gall (1758–1828) inthe beginning of the nineteenthcentury. Gall believed that specificpsychological traits could be local-ized to specific parts of the brain.When any of these individual traitswere prominent, that part of thebrain would grow larger relative tothe rest of the brain and would pushoutward against the skull. Theseenlarged brain areas would thencause bumps in the skull. Conse-quently, careful examination of theshape of the skull could reveal theperson’s psychological profile.
Gall based his conclusions on
empirical techniques (i.e., he mea-sured the skulls of hundreds of peo-ple), but his biased methodsallowed him to pick and choose hisfindings to fit his theories. Phrenology became very popular over the next centu-ry, and phrenology busts were quite common. Phrenology only fell out of favorin the twentieth century after modern science advanced enough to prove itwrong. As with eugenics, it was sometimes used to justify racist and sociallyprejudiced theories. Similarly, it was adopted by the Nazis to prove Aryansupremacy. On a more positive note, it challenged neuroscientists to study theimportant question of localization of function to ask which parts of the brain
support different psychological functions.
Phrenologists busts became very popular in the nineteenth
century. (istock)INTRODUCING THE BASICS
15Interested in the nature of sensation, he combined objective measures with rigor-
ously trained introspection. Researchers were taught to carefully monitor their own
perceptual and sensory experience. Wundt’s focus was on mapping the mechanics ofsensation with mathematical precision. He also taught hundreds of students and wasresponsible for training many of the major figures in the first few decades of the field.His focus on identifying the components of the mind was termed structuralism.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 15Why is William James considered the father of American psychology?
James (1842–1910) was among the first professors of psychology in the United States.
Hired by Harvard in 1872 as a professor of physiology, he took on the new title of pro-fessor of psychology in 1889. Like Wundt, he was an avid promoter of the new field ofpsychology. Just as Wundt did, James taught many students who would disseminatehis ideas into the wider world. Although his interests eventually took him far beyondpsychology, his publication Principles of Psychology had a long and powerful influ-
ence on the development of the field.
How did James differ from Wundt in his approach to psychology?
In general, James had a hard time with the atomistic approach to studying psychologyexemplified by Wundt’s lab. Although he ran his own lab using similar methodology, hefelt that the psychophysiology practiced by Wundt and others focused only on the small-est and ultimately least interesting of mental phenomena. He believed that treatingmoments of consciousness as discrete isolated units was at odds with the real nature ofexperience, which is continuous. He believed in the flow of consciousness. He was alsomore interested in holistic concerns, such as the meaning and continuity of the self.How do I know that I am me? What gives me the continuous sense of self across time?
This conflict between a holistic vs. atomistic approach marks a theme that per-
sists throughout the history of psychology as well as the natural sciences in general.Do we study something by breaking it down into its smallest parts or do we try tograsp it as an organic whole? Like Wundt, however, James was an advocate of intro-spection as a method of studying consciousness, something the behaviorists wouldlater reject vigorously.
How did James’s functionalism differ from Wundt’s structuralism?
James was particularly interested in how the mind affects behavior, how it helps usfunction in the world. He was less interested in simply identifying the components of
the mind, which was more in keeping with Wundt’s structuralism. In fact, later in hiscareer, James abandoned psychology for a school of philosophy called pragmatism.Pragmatists maintained that the value of a belief was less in its accuracy than in itseffectiveness, the degree to which it helped people function in their environment.
Who was Francis Galton?
Francis Galton (1822–1911) was never formally trained as a psychologist but, an extreme-ly innovative and creative man, he made enormous and long-lasting contributions to themethods of psychological research. In mid-life, after a wide range of endeavors, whichincluded explorations in Africa and new discoveries in meteorology, he became preoccu-pied with the question of the heritability of intelligence. Is intelligence passed on in fami-lies, much like height or hair color? That his own family tree was filled with gifted intel-
16Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 16lectuals is probably relevant to his choice
of study. He was a child prodigy and wasthe grandson of Erasmus Darwin (a notedphysician and botanist) and a first cousinof Charles Darwin.
What were the contributions of
Francis Galton?
In his search to prove the heritability ofintelligence, he made several astoundingmethodological innovations that are stillin wide use today. These included the sta-tistical technique of correlation (a mathe-matical test to see how much two traitsincrease or decrease together), the com-parison of identical and fraternal twins,the use of self-report questionnaires andword association tests, the phrase “natureand nurture” and the concept of “regression towards the mean.” This last idea derivesfrom Galton’s observation that when measurements are repeated over time, theextreme values tend to move toward the middle. For example, very tall parents willoften have less tall children. His less illustrious contribution was the field of eugenics.
What is eugenics?
Galton’s interest in the heritability of intelligence was not only academic. He wanted toapply it to social policy so that only families with high intelligence would breed and theless fortunate would be discouraged from reproducing. These ideas were expressed inseveral books and later spread to numerous academic departments and internationalsocieties. The fact that he greatly discounted the impact of environment on intellectualdevelopment, specifically the effect of social class, racial discrimination and access toeducation, inevitably set the stage for prejudicial and racist applications of this theory.Moral questions regarding the civil rights of the genetically “less fit” were also neglect-ed. Eugenics had significant impact on American immigration policies in the 1920s,justifying the restriction of Eastern and Southern European immigrants. Eugenics fellout of favor after the Nazis championed it in support of their genocidal policies.
What influence did Emil Kraepelin and Eugen Bleuler have on views of
mental illness?

nineteenth century. Concerned with severe mental illness, early psychiatry had littleoverlap with early psychology, which focused more on normal mental processes. Withthe later development of clinical psychology, however, psychiatry and psychologybecame more intertwined.
The German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin (1856–1926) first distinguished between
manic depressive illness and dementia praecox, or what was later called schizophre-nia. He saw manic depression as a milder form of illness with a more optimistic prog-nosis. In contrast, dementia praecox was seen as a progressively deteriorating illnesswith little hope of cure. Of course, there were no medicines available in the nineteenthcentury to effectively treat these conditions.
The Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler (1857–1939) was the director of the
renowned Burghölzli psychiatric hospital. Bleuler coined the term schizophrenia
from the Greek words for “split mind.” He believed schizophrenia encompassed agroup of diseases, which he subdivided into hebephrenic, catatonic, and paranoid sub-
18How can social prejudice impact psychological measurements?
The early history of psychological and the social sciences in general is litteredwith examples of gross social prejudice. In the early nineteenth century,
Franz Joseph Gall (1758–1828) introduced the study of phrenology, whichmapped various personality traits onto different parts of the brain. Although Galltried to ground his theories in the scientific measurement of skulls, he let hispreconceptions shape his collection and analysis of the data.
Later proponents of phrenology tried to use it to justify ethnic and class dis-
crimination. Likewise, Herbert Spencer (1820–1903), a proponent of Social Dar-winism, interpreted Darwin’s theory of natural selection as a justification for socialinequality. The studies of Francis Galton (1822–1911) on the heritability of intellec-tual giftedness led to the theory of eugenics, which promoted selective breeding ofthe social elite and discouraged childbearing within socially disadvantaged groups.
Not surprisingly, when psychological tests were first developed, they also fell
prey to the confusion between scientific objectivity and social prejudice. Thefirst intelligence tests were full of socially biased items that unfairly favoredaffluent, American-born English speakers over poor, uneducated immigrantsand non-white minorities. While psychological science has developed moresophisticated methodology to minimize the effect of experimenter bias of anykind, it is important to realize that as long as science is conducted by humanbeings, it is subject to human error. The beauty of science, however, lies in itsability to correct its own mistakes through further research.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 18types. He also introduced the term autism to describe the schizophrenic’s withdrawal
from the outer world.
SIGMUND FREUD
Who was Sigmund Freud?
Sigmund Freud (1856–1939) was a Viennese neurologist who became one of the most
influential figures of the twentieth century. As the inventor of psychoanalysis, heintroduced concepts of the unconscious, the impact of childhood, repressed emotions,and even the entire field of psychotherapy to the wider world. While aspects of his the-ories remain controversial, much of his work has become such an integral part of ourculture that it is taken for granted.
What are the major tenets of his theory of psychoanalysis?
Unlike the other pioneers of psychology, Freud was more interested in the abnormal thanthe normal. As a physician, he tended to the sick; thus, he developed his theories of themind through investigations of psychopathology. Although it is difficult to neatly summa-rize his ideas because they changed andevolved over more than four decades ofwork, there are several key concepts. Theseinclude the dynamic unconscious, theinstincts of libido and aggression (orThanatos), and the importance of child-hood conflicts on adult psychopathologyand even personality.
What was Freud’s view of
the unconscious ?
Unlike the early psychologists, who werealmost entirely concerned with consciousthought, Freud was fascinated by the ideathat our emotions, wishes, and thoughtscould operate wholly outside of con-sciousness. Moreover, unacceptable wish-es and impulses would be pushed backinto the unconscious to protect the per-son from anxiety. However, theserepressed desires would rarely sit calmly

Congress).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 19out of awareness, but rather come back to do mischief, generally in disguised form.
These partially expressed impulses formed the symptoms that psychoanalysis wasdesigned to cure.
What was Freud’s theory of the instincts?
Freud believed in two primary drives or motivations in life: libido and aggression.Libido, defined as sexuality although more accurately thought of as broad sensualpleasure, was his primary focus. He added the death instinct, Thanatos, after livingthrough the carnage of World War I. In later years, Thanatos was frequently interpret-ed as the aggressive drive. Freud asserted that an instinct functions like an electricalcharge that needs to be expressed through behavior.
However, he felt society forbids the free expression of sexuality and aggression.
Psychopathology, or what he termed neurosis, involves the conflict between ourinstinctual drives and our need to inhibit them. Because the instinct still presses forexpression, much like water rushing downhill, it will be displaced into another chan-nel of expression, resulting in a symptom, such as an obsession, compulsion, or a hys-terical complaint (a physical symptom without any true physical cause). His fluid-likeconception of the instincts was later referred to as the hydraulic model.
While this theory may appear odd from today’s point of view, it is easy to see that
he was attempting to fit his observations of his patients’ behavior into the scientificmodels of his day.
Where does childhood come in with Freud ?
Freud believed that the primary areas of instinctual gratification, the erogenouszones, moved across childhood in predictable stages. His theory of the psychosexualstages included the oral, anal, phallic, and genital stages. Each psychosexual stage hadspecific psychological characteristics to it. For example, the anal stage was character-ized by stinginess, concern with money, and/or wish for control. If the child was eitherundergratified or overgratified in any stage, the child could fixate at that stage,becoming, in effect, psychologically stuck.
Neurotic symptoms would reflect the person’s characteristic psychosexual stage.
For example, obsessions and compulsions reflected regression to the anal stage. WhileFreud’s instinctual theory has been much criticized, the notion that developmentalproblems at any point in childhood can hinder later development and result in adultpsychopathology must be seen as one of Freud’s greatest contributions.
What was revolutionary about Freud ?
Freud was revolutionary for several reasons. For one, he brought to light the wayunconscious passions can rule our lives–the battle between animalistic passions and
20Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 20the constraints of civilization. His particular emphasis on sexuality opened discussion
on a formerly taboo subject. Secondly, he drew attention to the effect of childhoodexperiences and trauma on adult emotional adjustment. Thirdly, his invention of themethod of psychoanalysis spearheaded the entire discipline of psychotherapy.
While psychoanalysis per se is no longer the preferred method of psychotherapy,
many forms of psychotherapy can be seen as the direct descendants of Freud’s couch.Finally, he brought the emotional and the irrational into the realm of science. Whilepoets, artists and philosophers had addressed the concerns of psychoanalysis before,few people had considered these questions in scientific terms.
How original were Freud’s ideas?
Freud did not operate in a vacuum. Many of his ideas came out of earlier philosophicalworks. For example, the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer (1788–1860)wrote about the primacy of unconscious sexual instincts as early as 1819. Moreover,Freud was not the first clinician to practice psychotherapy. By 1909, Freud’s approachto psychotherapy was just one among many competing forms of psychotherapy. Con-temporary psychotherapy in the early twentieth century was very crude, however, andstill focused largely on hypnotism and suggestion. Ultimately it was psychoanalysisthat had the widest impact on the later development of psychotherapy.
What was controversial about Freud ?
Freud was famous (or infamous) for his fights with detractors and is still a somewhatcontroversial figure. From the beginning Freudian theory tended toward the dogmatic.
21INTRODUCING THE BASICS
How did Sigmund Freud’s theories make their way
into a classic Alfred Hitchcock film?
Alfred Hitchcock’s classic suspense film Psycho, which came out in 1960, pro-
vides an excellent example of how Sigmund Freud’s theories have permeated
popular culture. In the famous shower scene, Marion Crane (played by Janet Leigh)is stabbed to death by a knife wielding Norman Bates (played by Tony Perkins). Atthe end of the movie we learn that Bates’s excessive attachment to his mother haslead him to murder her in a fit of jealous rage, following his discovery of her roman-tic involvement with another man. Attempting to keep his mother alive, however, hepreserves her body in the basement. At the same time, he takes on her identity as hisown alter ego. Finally, while dressed up as his dead mother, he murders MarionCrane to eliminate any possible rival for his attentions. Such unmistakably Oedipalthemes are clearly indebted to Sigmund Freud and psychoanalytic theory.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 21Although Freud was flexible in his own thinking, and he reworked his own theories mul-
tiple times, he was less tolerant of the divergent views of his followers. He rejected bothCarl Jung and Alfred Adler, who questioned the primacy of libido as the motivating force.
In Freud’s time, his theories were particularly controversial for their emphasis on
sexuality, which was rarely discussed openly in Victorian times. His emphasis on childsexuality was thought frankly perverted. By the mid-twentieth century, however,Freudian theory was criticized mainly for its lack of scientific data. Although heaspired to make psychoanalysis a science, he never tested his theories with the meth-ods of empirical research, preferring instead to rely on his clinical observations.
How has Freudian theory influenced contemporary culture?
Freud has had enormous influence on contemporary culture, so much so that weoften barely notice. Any attention to the unconscious meaning of slips of the tongue,jokes, or dreams can be traced directly to Freud. Awareness of the impact of childhoodexperiences on adult emotional adjustment, the importance of sexuality, and the valueof talking out our feelings, let alone the now international industry of psychotherapy,all owe their debt to Freud. Freudian ideas also captured the imagination of a widerange of famous artists and writers throughout the twentieth century, such as the sur-realists, Virginia Woolf, and Alfred Hitchcock.
JOHN B. WATSON AND B. F. SKINNER
Who was John B.Watson?
John Watson (1878–1958) spearheaded the triumph of behaviorism in American psy-
chology. Reacting against the emphasis on introspection promoted by both Wundt andJames, he believed that the only object of psychological study should be observable
behavior. He criticized the introspective approach as imprecise and dependent onunverifiable, and therefore unreliable, subjective judgments. Influenced by the Russ-ian psychologist Ivan Pavlov’s work on associative conditioning, he reduced all of psy-chology to stimulus-response chains.
Having also spent the beginning of his career studying rats in mazes, Watson fur-
ther broke down the division between animal and human research, stating that stimu-lus-response behavioral chains in animals did not meaningfully differ from those inhumans. In other words, the only worthwhile subject of study in psychology was howanimals or people behaved in response to carefully observed stimuli. Moreover, he felt,the purpose of such study was the prediction and control of behavior.
This viewpoint was articulated in a 1913 publication entitled “Psychology as the
Behaviorist Sees It.” While behaviorism became less restrictive in later years, this cel-
22Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 22ebration of observable behavior and disdain for subjective experience dominated
American academic psychology until the middle of the twentieth century.
What was unusual about Watson’s personal life?
Watson had an unusually dramatic and difficult life. Born into poverty with an alco-holic, womanizing, and violent father who abandoned the family when Watson wasonly twelve, Watson seemed more likely to enter a life of crime than to become a pio-neer in the field of psychology. He was, in fact, arrested twice before he managed toconvince the president of a South Carolina college to admit him as a freshman at theage of sixteen.
The brash confidence displayed by his appeal to the college president was charac-
teristic of the ambition and audacity that would later propel his career. He excelledacademically and quickly progressed from student to graduate student to assistantshipto professor at the University of Chicago and then, by age thirty, to chairman of thepsychology department at Johns Hopkins University. At age thirty-seven he was madepresident of the American Psychological Association.
Unfortunately, he remained a compulsive womanizer and during a particularly
indiscreet extramarital affair, his wife found evidence of his dalliance and showed it tothe president of the university, who promptly demanded his resignation. In 1920 suchscandal could ruin one’s reputation and it ended Watson’s career as an academic psy-chologist. Ever resilient, however, he eventually obtained a position at the J. WalterThompson advertising agency, applying his psychological expertise to advertisingcampaigns on a wealth of household products. He married the woman with whom hehad been having an affair and had two children with her. Unfortunately, she died quiteyoung, which was, by many accounts, a devastating loss for him.
We can speculate about the relationship between Watson’s painful childhood and his
choice of psychological theories. Is it entirely a coincidence that an emotionally troubledchild would grow up to shun exploration of the mind? Nonetheless, whatever personalappeal behaviorism might have had for Watson, its dominance in American academicpsychology cannot be attributed to the psychological conflicts of a single individual.
Who was B.F. Skinner?
Burrhus Frederick (B.F .) Skinner (1904–1990) was a famous champion of behavior-ism. He wrote several books, including Walden Two and About Behaviorism, in which
he spelled out his views on psychology, in particular the view that observable behaviorwas the only valid object of scientific study. Like John Watson before him, he had aflair for public relations and knew how to get his ideas into the public eye.
Skinner made numerous long-lasting contributions to behaviorism. He was inter-
ested both in the theory of behaviorism and its application to everyday problems. His
23INTRODUCING THE BASICSHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 23two most important contributions
include the principles of operant condi-tioning and the techniques of behavioralmodification. He was also interested ineducational methods and in techniques ofanimal training. Although Skinner’s radi-cal behaviorism has been out of fashionfor several decades, many of his coreideas survive. While they cannot explainall of human psychology, they do offerimportant insights into a broad range ofbehavior. Moreover, the techniques heproposed are still fundamental tools in adramatically broad range of disciplines.
What is Skinner’s concept of operant
conditioning?
Building on Edward Thorndike’s earlierLaw of Effect, Skinner elaborated the wayanimals and humans learn from rewardsand punishments. If a behavior is followedby a reward, it is likely to be repeated. If itis followed by a punishment, it is less like-
ly to be repeated. Through research on rats and other animals, Skinner explored ingreat detail how the timing, frequency, and predictability of rewards and punishmentsaffect behavioral change. Thes e basic concepts of operant conditioning were viewed as
the foundation of all learned behavior in both humans and animals. While we nowknow that there are many complex forms of thought that operant conditioning cannotexplain, these principles do tell us a tremendous amount about basic forms of learningand memory.
What was Skinner’s contribution to behavioral modification?
Another critical contribution that Skinner made was to translate his laboratoryresearch on rats and other animals into a new form of psychotherapy termed behav-
ioral modification. Although John Watson had declared the purpose of behaviorism tobe the prediction and control of behavior, he did not have much success in formulat-ing specific techniques to be applied to everyday life.
In contrast to Watson, Skinner worked out rules about how to change human
behavior through the manipulation of reinforcement contingencies , in other words,
the manipulation of rewards and punishments. Skinner favored the use of rewards
24
B.F . Skinner (1904–1990) was famous for his work in
behaviorism.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 24over punishment to modify behavior, as he felt a reliance on punishment created more
problems than it solved. He initially developed his behavior modification techniquesfor use with psychotic psychiatric patients, but variations of his techniques have beenapplied to work with juvenile delinquents and emotionally disturbed children. Similartechniques have been adapted for use with animal training, child rearing, and manyother disciplines.
What is the Skinner box?
Another innovation created by B.F . Skinner is called the Skinner box. This was an
adaptation of Thorndike’s puzzle box, used by scientists to observe how an animallearns to escape the box. Skinner’s innovation was to connect the animal’s behavior(e.g., a rat pressing a bar) to a counting mechanism so that the number of times thebehavior was performed would be automatically recorded. This way the frequency ofthe behavior could be compared across different reinforcement conditions. For exam-ple the number of times a rat presses a bar when each bar press is rewarded with afood pellet can be compared with the frequency of bar pressing when the rat is notrewarded with food pellets.
What were Skinner’s contributions to educational practices?
Skinner was also interested in applying operant conditioning principles to education.He introduced the concept of programmed learning, in which the material to betaught is presented in a sequence of small steps. Thus learning progresses step by step,with positive reinforcement given after each step is mastered. Although this approachhas been criticized for its restricted focus on parts rather than the whole and for fail-ing to foster creative thinking, it still serves as the basis for most forms of computer-ized training.
25INTRODUCING THE BASICS
Did Skinner raise his daughter in a Skinner box?
Skinner also developed a form of crib/playpen that he termed an “air crib”(also called a “baby-tender” or an “heir conditioner”). This was a large, well-
lit and temperature-controlled chamber for a small child. He raised his seconddaughter Deborah in this chamber for the first few years of her life. Contrary topopular thought, this was not a classic Skinner box, where rats have to presslevers to obtain food; it was more like a roomy bassinet. Although criticsassumed his daughter had been damaged by a bizarrely technical approach tochild rearing, Skinner always maintained that his daughter had not suffered andhad, in fact, grown up to be a well-adjusted, college-educated artist.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 25JEAN PIAGET
Who was Jean Piaget?
Jean Piaget (1896–1980) was a Swiss psychologist who pioneered the study of cognitive
development. Ironically, Piaget never received formal training in psychology. In fact, hereceived his doctorate in the natural sciences. Along with Freud and B.F . Skinner, how-ever, Piaget is one of the most influential figures in all of psychology. Piaget showed atalent for scientific research from a very early age. He published his first scientificpaper on the albino sparrow at age ten, although the publisher had no idea of his extra-ordinary youth. For four years in his early teens, he classified mollusks in the Neuchå-tel Natural History Museum in Switzerland. He published several more scholarlypapers from ages fifteen to eighteen. Around the same time, Piaget visited his godfa-ther, Samuel Cornut, who felt that Piaget’s education was weighted toward the naturalsciences. Cornut introduced him to philosophy, sparking Piaget’s interest in epistemol-ogy, the philosophical study of knowledge. Questions such as “What is knowledge?” and“Where does knowledge come from?” would form the foundation of his later work.
How was Piaget influenced by
working with intelligence tests?
Early in his career, Piaget went to workfor Theodore Simon in Paris. Simon,along with Alfred Binet, was the author ofthe Binet-Simon intelligence test, thefirst successful test of its kind. Piaget’sjob was to record the answers of five- toeight-year-old children in order to deter-mine expected scores for each age group.Although he was hired to record the cor-rect answers, he became far more inter-ested in the children’s mistakes, in thetypical patterns of error at each age. Thissparked his interest in the developmentof children’s intellectual understandingof the world around them. He had foundhis life’s work. For the next sixty years,Piaget studied children’s behavior ingreat detail. From this data, he generateda voluminous body of writings on thesubject and changed the way we look atintellectual development.
26
Jean Piaget (1896–1980) made fundamental contributions to
our understanding of children’s intellectual development(AP/WideWorld).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 26What did Piaget discover?
Piaget’s greatest contribution was to change psychologists’ focus from what we know
to how we know. He studied how the mind organizes and transforms information—how it shapes information. The mind is not a blank screen; it is not a camera or a mir-ror that simply reflects what it sees. It is an active participant in knowledge. The mindtakes in information and actively organizes it. As such, it constructs a view of reality
through this shaping and transforming of information. This concept is referred to asPiaget’s constructivist view of knowledge. Moreover, the way that the mind organizes
information changes across child development. So younger children do not simplyknow less than older children or adults; they know differently .
Why is Piaget’s work important?
Freud told us about desire, the behaviorists told us about behavior, and Piaget told usabout the way we think and how that develops across childhood. Perhaps more thananyone else, he has told us about how we make sense of our environment, the process-es by which we interpret it. His work has been profoundly influential to many branch-es of psychology: developmental, cognitive, educational, and even clinical.
What did Piaget think about the nature/nurture debate?
There is an age-old debate, dating back to the earliest Greek philosophers, of whetherknowledge is innate—that is we are born with it—or whether it is learned throughexperience. Piaget’s solution to this ancient dilemma was to propose that knowledge isboth innate and learned. What we know is learned and how we know is based on
innate capacities.
How do children learn by action?
Although other forms of information may be important, Piaget believed the initial andfundamental way that children learn about the world is through action. Through action,children explore and encounter their environment. The memories of these encountersare encoded in their minds as knowledge. These memories then shape their interpreta-tion of later experiences, which in turn modifies their knowledge about the world. Forexample a child is given a rattle. By chance the child shakes it and it makes noise. Inter-ested, the child shakes it again. Later, another rattle is produced, which the child imme-diately shakes, now having a rudimentary concept of rattles as something to shake.
What is a schema?
A schema is a representation or a map of a pattern of events. It is essentially the build-
ing block of knowledge. Infants’ initial knowledge of the world is through action 27INTRODUCING THE BASICSHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 27schemas or sensory-motor schemas. This means the child can only know the world
through immediate sensation or direct action, such as bringing the thumb into the
mouth or seeing bicycle wheels go round and round. Around nine months of age,these action schemas begin to exist in the mind alone. In other words, the child canthink about the event when it is not actually occurring. The mental life of the child
has begun. A mental representation of an event is called a conceptual schema . One
sign of this is called object permanence, which occurs around nine months of agewhen an infant will look for an object after it is hidden from view, such as searchingfor a rattle after it is hidden behind a pillow.
What are assimilation and accommodation?
Assimilation and accommodation are the two ways that children gain new knowledge.In assimilation, the new is fitted into the old; in accommodation, the old is adapted tothe new. This is the way that schemas develop. Accomodation means that a schemawill become modified by new information. For example, an infant is handed a rattlethat is shaped differently than any previously encountered rattles. Because of the dif-ferent shape, the infant has to grasp it in a different way. Thus the schema of graspingthe rattle has just accommodated to the new action.
Assimilation is the complement of accommodation and refers to the way new
information is adapted to previously existing schemas. For example, when presentedwith the new rattle, the infant tries to grasp it and shake it. This reflects an attempt toassimilate the new action with the pre-existing rattle schema. Throughout develop-
ment, both processes occur simultaneously.
How have Piaget’s theories been criticized?
Piaget has been criticized for relying almost exclusively on the intellectual content ofknowledge. Piaget paid little attention to the impact of culture, emotion, observational
28What is object permanence?
Jean Piaget’s notion of object permanence refers to the ability to hold an image ofan object in the mind even when it is not concretely present. Piaget developed this
concept while studying the behavior of his own children. He noticed that before theage of eight or nine months, if he removed an object of interest from his child (e.g., arattle), the child would not search for it. Once it was out of sight, it was out of mind.After the development of object permanence, however, the child displayed searchingbehavior. For example, if Piaget removed the toy from the child and hid it behind apillow, the child would move the pillow to find the object. This searching behaviorshows that the child can think about the object even when it is not present.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 28learning, and verbal instruction on cognitive development. Indeed, later research has
shown that children’s (and adults’) knowledge of the world is greatly impacted by all ofthe above factors. Nonetheless, this does not invalidate Piaget’s contributions; it simplyshows that his work is limited in scope. He cannot explain all of children’s mental life,but he did tell us a tremendous amount about early cognitive development.
What role did Piaget’s children have in the development of his theories?
Much of the fundamental ideas of Piaget’s work were based on his intense, methodicalobservations of his own three children, Jacqueline, Laurent, and Lucienne. Their moth-er was a trained psychologist herself and helped in these studies. In fact, she had beenone of Piaget’s students. Although we can question what emotional impact this intenseattention may have had on these children, Piaget’s investigations were never invasive oreven particularly experimental. Relying on a naturalistic approach, for the most part heobserved their natural behavior, questioned them about their understanding of naturalevents, or minimally modified their environment, for example by manipulating toys.

Across its fairly short history, psychology has had several major theoretical move-
ments. Perhaps the most important are Behaviorism, Gestalt Theory, Psychoanalyticand Psychodynamic Theory, Humanistic Theories, Attachment Theory, Sociobiology,Neurobiological Theories, and Cognitive Science. Some of these movements were nat-ural outgrowths of earlier ones. Others were reactions against earlier approaches.Most contemporary psychologists do not limit themselves to any one theoretical view.Nonetheless, these movements have shaped psychology’s history and continue toinfluence contemporary psychologists’ orientation to research and practice. Thus, it isimportant to understand the major movements in the history of psychology to trulyappreciate modern findings.
BEHAVIORISM
What is behaviorism?
Behaviorism is the school of psychology that considers observable behavior to be theonly worthwhile object of study. Behaviorists believe mental phenomena are impossi-ble to measure objectively and thus impossible to prove. They therefore focus on theprocesses underlying behavioral change, specifically classical (or associative or
Pavlovian) conditioning and operant conditioning. These basic learning principlesoperate in humans and animals alike, or at least in mammals and birds.
Major figures of behaviorism included John B. Watson (1878–1958), Edward
Thorndike (1874–1947), and B.F . Skinner (1904–1990). Although Freudian psycho-analysis, educational psychology, and other mental schools of psychology continued in

MAJOR 
MOVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGYHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 3132tandem, behaviorism was the dominant force in American psychology until well into
the middle of the twentieth century.
What was Thorndike’s Law of Effect?
Edward Thorndike (1874–1947) was originally a student of Henry James, although hisresearch veered far from James’s fascination with consciousness. As a side note, hewas also the author of the Thorndike dictionary. Thorndike turned to the study ofchickens while still a graduate student and then expanded his research to observationsof cats and dogs. By placing an animal in a puzzle box, or an enclosure with only onemeans of escape, he could study how the animal learned to escape the box. Heobserved that animals initially stumble on the escape route (e.g., stepping on a peddleor biting a string) through trial and error. With repeated trials, however, animals takeless time to find their way out.
Based on this research, Thorndike formulated two laws of learning. The Law of
Effect states that the effect of an action will determine the likelihood that it will be
repeated. In other words, if the response generates a satisfying effect (the cat pulls thestring and the door opens), the cat is more likely to pull the string again. If the actiongenerates a negative impact, the animal is less likely to repeat the action.
This concept forms the bedrock of B.F . Skinner’s later theory of operant condi-
tioning. Thorndike’s Law of Exercise likewise contributed to theories of associative
conditioning. Here he stated that the strength of an association between a responseand a stimulus will depend on the number of times they have been paired and thestrength of their pairing. Thorndike thus took the associationism of philosophers
such as Thomas Hobbes and placed it into a scientific paradigm.
What is the black box theory of the mind?
In this view, the mind is no more than an opaque black box inserted between stimulusand response. As no one can see inside of it, it is not worthy of study. This extremeantimentalism of the behaviorists has been frequently criticized and was finally put to
rest by the cognitive revolution in the 1960s. While the behaviorists made invaluablecontributions to psychology regarding the fundamental principles of behavioralchange, their devaluing and dismissal of subjective experience was extremely limiting.
How do behaviorists understand learning?
Behaviorism is best described as a theory of learning and, in fact, is often referred to aslearning theory. However, the mental process of learning had to be translated intobehavioral terms. Thus learning occurs when a new behavior is repeatedly and consis-tently performed in response to a given stimulus.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 32What famous experiment did Ivan Pavlov perform using dogs?
Ivan Pavlov (1849–1936) was a
Russian scientist who was original-
ly interested in the digestive process-es of animals. When trying to studyhow dogs digest food, he noticed theanimals’ tendency to salivate at thesound or sight of their keeper shortlybefore feeding time. In other words,they salivated in the absence of actu-al food. Initially, this phenomenonwas a nuisance, interfering with hisstudy of digestion, but later itbecame the focus of his research.Pavlov’s studies provided the basis ofthe theory of classical conditioning,also known as associative or “Pavlov-ian” conditioning.
Pavlov developed his famous theory of classical conditioning
after watching dogs salivate right before mealtime at themere sight or sound of their keeper ( iStock).MAJOR MOVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGY
33Where does emotion fit in?
Although strict behaviorists avoided all emotional terms, learning theory fully
depends on emotion. In Thorndike’s Law of Effect and the theory of operant condi-tioning that followed, the likelihood that a behavior will be increased or decreaseddepends on its emotional impact. Behavior is increased when it elicits positive emo-tion (reward) and reduced when it elicits negative emotion (punishment). While it ismore difficult to speak of emotions in animals, modern scientists assume that thesimple emotional processes involved in learning theory—that is, forms of pleasureand pain—apply to both animals and humans.
What is associative or classical conditioning?
Associative conditioning, also called classical or Pavlovian conditioning, refers to aform of learning in which a person or animal is conditioned to respond in a particular
way to a specific stimulus. If a neutral stimulus is paired with an emotionally mean-ingful one, than the neutral stimulus will become associated with the second stimulus
and elicit the same response. For example, if a child learns to associate a particularperfume with a beloved grandmother, the child will develop a positive response to theperfume. In contrast, if the child learns to associate going to the doctor with getting apainful shot, then the child will learn to fear the doctor. This basic concept is used inHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 33child rearing, advertising, political campaigns, the treatment of addictions, and much
of animal training.
What is the difference between the conditioned and the
unconditioned stimulus?
The unconditioned stimulus is the stimulus that elicits a natural and unlearned response.For example, the child does not have to learn to feel pain from the shot. A dog does nothave to learn to feel pleasure when fed. The conditioned stimulus is a formerly neutralstimulus that now elicits a response through its pairing with the conditioned stimulus.The perfume that the child associates with his grandmother is a conditioned stimulus.The doctor that the child associates with the shot is also a conditioned stimulus.
What is the difference between the conditioned and the
unconditioned response ?
The unconditioned response is the innate, unlearned response, for example loving the
grandmother or feeling pain at the shot. The conditioned response is the learned
response, for example loving the grandmother’s perfume or fearing the doctor.
How is classical conditioning relevant to everyday life?
Classical conditioning pervades everyday life. When we develop food aversions (e.g., ahatred of fish), phobias (a fear of dogs), positive associations (an association of Pariswith a romantic vacation) our behavior reflects classical conditioning. It is thereforeno accident that so many advertising campaigns hire young, beautiful, and skimpilyclad models. The advertisers want consumers to associate their product—be it a wash-ing machine, paper clip, or automobile—with youth, beauty, and sex.
How is classical conditioning relevant to animal behavior?
As (non-human) animals lack higher cognitive abilities, such as complex reasoning,symbolic thought, or language, associative conditioning is a primary way that animalslearn. Does your cat love to sit on the couch and purr? Does she associate the couchwith affection and attention? Does your dog start to bark and wag his tail when youput on your shoes? Does he associate your shoes with his walk?
What is operant conditioning?
In operant conditioning, pioneered by B.F . Skinner (1904–1990), behavior is influencedless by the stimulus with which it is associated than by the effect of that behavior. Oper-ant conditioning builds on Thorndike’s Law of Effect. If the effect of the behavior is
34Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 34positive, then it is reinforced, and the behavior is more likely to recur. If the effect of
the behavior is negative, then it is punished and therefore less likely to be repeated.
What are reinforcers ?
Reinforcers are consequences of a behavior that increase the likelihood that the
behavior will be repeated. For example, if a child is given an ice cream cone as conso-lation after throwing a temper tantrum, the temper tantrum has been reinforced.
Reinforcers can be either positive or negative.
What is the difference between positive and negative reinforcement
Positive reinforcement is also called reward, and refers to the positive consequence of
a behavior, which increases its likelihood of recurring. For example, employees arepaid to do their job and performers who perform well are applauded. Negative rein-forcement, to be distinguished from punishment, involves the removal of a negative
condition as a consequence of the targeted behavior. If you lose weight by dieting, thatis negative reinforcement.

Who is Little Albert?
Starting in 1920, John Watson conducted a series of experiments on a babynamed Albert B. to investigate classical conditioning in human beings. While
these experiments successfully support the principles of conditioned learning,Watson was chillingly insensitive to the emotional impact of his research meth-ods on the baby.
When Albert was about nine months old he was exposed to a series of white
fuzzy items, including a white rat, rabbit, dog, monkey, and masks with and with-out white cotton hair. The presence of the rat was then paired with a loud noisecreated by banging a hammer against a steel pipe. This was repeated several timesuntil little Albert grew terrified at the mere sight of the rat. Later experimentsshowed that Albert’s fearful reactions had generalized to other fuzzy white items,including a rabbit, dog, and Santa Claus mask. This generalized fear was still pre-sent several months after the original experiment.

How effective is punishment?
Punishment involves the introduction ofa negative consequence to a behavior
with the intent of diminishing the fre-quency of the behavior. When a child isgrounded for getting into a fight, this ispunishment. The parents are trying todiminish the targeted behavior. Likewise,the criminal justice system relies on pun-ishment to maintain an orderly and law-ful society. Punishment can be extremelyeffective but it also has drawbacks.Although the early behaviorists avoided
mental considerations, it is now clear that punishment, if done too frequently, createsanger, fear, and resentment and can breed an oppositional mindset, in which peopletry to cheat the system instead of willingly following the rules. B.F . Skinner distrustedpunishment as well, stating that it had only short term effects and it did not teachalternative behavior.
How is operant conditioning relevant to everyday life?
Operant conditioning is in evidence in almost every aspect of daily life. When we arepaid for our work, evaluated for a merit raise by our managers, thanked by a friend forbeing considerate, penalized for paying taxes late, or even given a parking ticket, oper-ant conditioning is in play.
How is operant conditioning relevant to animal life?
Most of animal training involves operant conditioning. When we spray our cat with asquirt gun after he jumps on the kitchen counter or give our dog a treat after he rollsover, we are using operant conditioning. Even pigeons can be shaped to do a particularbehavior, such as peck at a lever, by successively rewarding behavior that more closelyapproximates the desired behavior.
What is extinction?
When the association starts to erode between the stimulus and the response (in classi-cal conditioning) or between the behavior and the reinforcement (in operant condi-tioning), a behavior becomes extinguished. A behavior is extinguished when it is no

One example of positive reinforcement is a mouse receiving
cheese for successfully navigating a maze ( iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 36longer performed. This can be a positive thing if the behavior was undesirable to begin
with. It can also be negative if the behavior was valued. In general, the behaviorshould eventually extinguish if it is no longer accompanied by either the prior rein-forcement or the unconditioned stimulus. If you stop paying people to go to work,they will probably stop going. If you stopped taking your dog for a walk after you puton your shoes, the dog will eventually stop barking and wagging his tail each time youput them on. The association between sneakers and walk will be extinguished.
How do reinforcement conditions affect learning?
Although the principles of conditioning are very simple, they are less simple in prac-tice. A number of factors affect the effectiveness of conditioning. Timing is important,
specifically the time separating the unconditioned and conditioned stimulus. If thesneakers go on too soon before the dog is walked, it will be hard to associate the shoeswith the walk.
Relatedly, the reinforcement should closely follow the behavior for the act to be con-
nected with the consequence. This is why news of global warming has had so little effectuntil recently, although we’ve known about it for decades. The consequences were notimmediate. This is also why it is so difficult to instill healthy habits in the young, whenthe consequences of their self care will not be evident for decades. The schedule of rein-
forcement also affects learning. Should the behavior be reinforced every time it occurs?What kind of reinforcement makes a behavior most resistant to extinction?

How is classical conditioning related to drug addiction?
Classical conditioning is central to the process of drug addiction. Addictiontreatment often focuses on the management of craving. Craving, or the urge
to use the problem drug, can be very strong and frequently leads to relapses inpeople striving for sobriety. Craving is triggered by cues, both external and inter-nal, via the process of classical conditioning. In other words, the person encoun-ters a reminder of drug use (such as drug paraphernalia or the bar where the
person used to drink) and the association stimulates craving. This is basicallythe same conditioning process Pavlov noticed with his dogs. External cuesinclude environmental factors (people, places, and things). Internal cues includeemotions, thought, or physical sensations that previously led to drug use.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 37reinforced every time it occurs, they will be less likely to stop the behavior when it is
not reinforced. It will take longer for them to give up on the behavior. Further, whenintermittent reinforcement is unpredictable, it is even more resistant to extinction.
What problems with behaviorism started to show up even among
the faithful?
As the reign of behaviorism continued, the limits of the paradigm became more evi-dent. Animals kept behaving in ways that could not be explained by behaviorist theoryalone. For example, Skinner had thought that any animal could be taught any behav-ior with the appropriate reinforcement schedule. But this did not turn out to be thecase. The same behavior was learned easily by some animals, with difficulty by others,and not at all by still others. Rats could easily learn to press a bar for food, while catswould do so only with difficulty. These findings suggest that the genetics of each ani-mal species set the parameters of what could and could not be learned. There werelimits to what could be taught.
How did Tolman’s contributions mark the beginning of the endof the
behaviorist era?
Edward Chase Tolman (1886–1959) was a devoted behaviorist who studied maze-run-ning behavior in rats (a favorite topic of behaviorist researchers). Despite his expecta-tions, he repeatedly observed behavior in rats that he could not explain solely by stim-ulus-response connections. He noticed that rats in a maze would often stop, lookaround, and check out one path, then another before choosing a particular route. Hecould only explain this behavior (and many other similar behaviors he observed) byinferring some kind of mental process. The rat seemed to have a mental picture of thelayout of the maze and that directed its behavior. In this way, Tolman introduced themind into the behaviorist stronghold. Even rats running mazes evidenced mentalprocesses, some form of thinking about the problem.
38How is intermittent reinforcement used in gambling?
In gambling, the behavior of betting is rewarded intermittently and unpre-
dictably. When the gambler’s bet is not rewarded, the gambler continues to
bet, expecting that another win will follow sooner or later. If the gambler hadbeen rewarded for every bet, it would take fewer losses for the gambler to disas-sociate betting with winning and for the act of gambling to be extinguished.Thus casinos take advantage of an intermittent and unpredictable reinforcementschedule in order to keep gamblers gambling as long as possible.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 38How were mental processes evident even in rats running mazes?
Tolman introduced the notions of expectancy, of mental maps, into behaviorism. Rats
and other animals did not simply respond to the number of rewards for each behavior,automatically repeating the most frequently rewarded behavior. Some kind of thoughtprocess mediated between stimulus and response. More specifically, the rats appearedto develop a set of expectations about how events would play out based on their priorexperiences. They then made decisions by matching their expectations against infor-mation from the new situation. This kind of mental map is essentially identical toPiaget’s concept of mental schemas and has become a critical concept in many areasof psychology, including cognitive, developmental, and clinical psychology.
What was the Cognitive Revolution?
In the 1950s and 1960s several lines of development converged to create the explosiveshift in academic psychology known as the cognitive revolution. Research in various
other fields of study, such as anthropology, linguistics, and computer science, hadbeen moving toward the scientific study of mental processes. Within psychology, stud-ies of memory, perception, personality traits, and other mental phenomena continuedto gain ground.
Even orthodox behaviorists were stumbling onto mental processes. As these lines of
development came together, the mind once again became a worthy object of study. Theblack box model of psychology was rejected and cognition, or thought processes per se,became the object of intense interest. Major contributors included Ulric Neisser, HowardKendler, and George and Jean Mandler. With the renewed interested in cognitiveprocesses, there was also a resurgence of an earlier movement that had started inEurope but migrated to the United States after World War II, namely Gestalt psychology.
GESTALT PSYCHOLOGY
What is the basic concept of Gestalt psychology?
Gestalt psychology, which started in the early twentieth century, provided an impor-tant counterpoint to the academic psychology of its time, specifically Watson’s behav-iorism and Wundt’s structuralism. Its full impact, however, would not be felt untilmany decades after its birth. Gestalt psychology originated in 1910 with MaxWertheimer’s study of the perception of motion.
The core idea behind Gestalt psychology is that the mind actively organizes infor-
mation into a coherent whole or a gestalt. In other words, the mind is not a passiverecipient of sensory stimuli but an active organizer of information. Furthermore,knowledge does not come from a collection of isolated bits of information. Rather the
39MAJOR MOVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGYHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 3940mind creates a whole out of the relationships between separate parts. Gestalt psychol-
ogy is a holistic theory.
What is a gestalt?
A gestalt refers to a perceptual whole. The gestalt is created out of the relationships
between the parts. Our perceptual knowledge of the world is based on our recognition
of these relationships. For example, let us consider what we recognize as a table.Although a table can be large or small, metal or wood, dark or light, we recognize anobject as a table if it has a flat, horizontal plane with one or more supports underneathit. Its gestalt is determined by the relationship among its parts.
How do Gestalt ideas pertain to perception?
Gestalt psychology countered the assumption that perception is based solely on the stim-ulation hitting our sensory organs. As the sensory stimulation coming in differs depend-ing upon the circumstance, we would not be able to recognize an object or person as thesame across different situations if our mind did not actively organize our perceptions torecognize the gestalt. For example, we recognize our neighbor as the same person even if
he loses weight, changes his clothes, or cuts his hair. Clearly the sensory information dif-fers in each circumstance yet somehow we still recognize our neighbor as one person.
Who were the pioneers of Gestalt theory?
Max Wertheimer (1880–1943) is recognized as the father of Gestalt theory. His inter-est was first piqued when he noticed the illusion of motion while sitting on a train.Although the landscape outside the train was stationary, it seemed to be moving back-wards as the train sped by. Most of us have had the same experience. To Wertheimer,however, this phenomenon offered a unique window into the workings of the mind.When he began his investigations at the University of Frankfurt in 1910, two slightlyyounger psychologists, Wolfgang Köhler (1887–1967), and Kurt Koffka (1886–1941)came to work with him. Together they studied the illusion of movement through vari-ous experiments. Their research into the phi effect, as Wertheimer named it, was thebeginning of a life-long, shared commitment to Gestalt research and theory. By themid-1930s, all three men had relocated to the United States, Koffka before Hitler’s riseto power, and Wertheimer and Köhler in direct response to it.
Why is Gestalt theory important?
Arguably, Gestalt theory is important more for its profound philosophical implicationsthan for the specifics of its research findings. For one thing, by demonstrating itsprinciples with solid empirical research, Gestalt theory put the mind back into acade-
mic psychology. Secondly, gestalt theory introduced a holistic paradigm, which was inHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 40What does Gestalt theory tell us about optical illusions?
The Gestalt theorists were fond of
optical illusions as they illustrat-
ed how the mind actively organizesperceptual information. The fact thatwe can see something that is notreally there shows that our percep-tions are more than an exact copy ofreality. In the photo to the right, afield of rounded dots can seen aseither convex (rows of buttons) or asconcave (rows of holes). Notice thatyou can perceive either buttons orholes but you cannot perceive both atthe same time. In order for your per-ception to switch, you have to look atsomething other than the dots, suchas the flat area between the dots.

41sharp contrast to the associationist approach found in both behaviorism and Wilhelm
Wundt’s structuralism. In associationism, complex knowledge is seen to derive entire-ly from associations between simple memories. Gestalt theorists rejected this view as
overly simplistic as they believed that complex knowledge also develops holistically,through recognition of patterns and identification of the whole.
How did the holistic view of Gestalt theory go against the scientific
worldview of the time?
In the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, when psychology was com-ing into its own as a science, there was tremendous admiration for the accomplish-ments of physical science. This was a time of extraordinary technological changes. Thetelephone, the motor car, the moving picture—all of these were relatively recentinventions and all of them radically changed society. Science was exploding across theindustrialized world and there was a widely shared assumption that the only worth-while way to understand reality was through the methods used in the physical sci-ences. And these methods largely reflected an analytic approach to reason.
In other words, the way to understand complex phenomena (such as human psy-
chology) was to break it down into its smallest parts (such as stimulus-response associa-tions). Complexity in and of itself had no interest; it simply reflected a grouping ofHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 41smaller parts. The whole could be reduced to the sum of its parts. Gestalt theorists chal-
lenged this reductionist assumption. They were interested in synthetic reasoning. How
do you put the parts back together again? How do you make a whole out of the relation-
ships between parts? Their core position was that “the whole is greater than the sum ofits parts.”
How did William James’s functionionalism anticipate Gestalt theory?
Gestalt theory had much in common with James’s interest in the holistic flow of con-sciousness. Like Wertheimer and his colleagues, James did not believe we can under-stand reality simply by breaking it down into its elemental parts. In order to under-stand the whole of reality, we must look at it as a whole. Gestalt theorists felt thatJames did not go far enough, however, in his rejection of reductionistic assumptions.But this may not be fair to James, who after all died in 1910, the same year thatWertheimer first became fascinated with the perception of movement.
What other principles of perception come from Gestalt theory?
Gestalt psychology proposes a series of rules by which the mind organizes perceptualinformation. These include the rules of proximity, similarity, simplicity, and closure.The first two rules suggest that objects that are placed closely together (proximity) orare similar to each other (similarity) will be grouped together into a gestalt. The mindwill combine them into a whole. Closure reflects the tendency to fill in the gaps of agestalt. If we see a circle with sections missing, we will still see it as a circle. Further,the mind will group parts into a whole according to the simplest solution. 
42What does “the whole is greater than
the sum of its parts” mean?
This phrase is one Gestalt psychology’s most famous contributions. TheGestalt psychologists believed that there are properties of the whole that exist
independently of their component parts. Consider that human beings are com-posed of cells and tissues. At a smaller scale we are composed of atoms. But canwe ever explain our loves, our personalities, our prejudices, and even our taste inmusic solely by studying the behavior of our atoms? Or by studying our cells?The Gestaltists would say no. There are qualities of the whole that cannot bereduced to the qualities of its parts. Although Gestalt theory is best known for itswork with perception, this core concept has been applied to almost every aspectof psychology. It has influenced Piagetian developmental psychologists, cogni-tive psychologists, and even psychotherapists.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 42What were Wolfgang Köhler’s studies on insight learning?
Wolfgang Köhler (1887–1967) was one of Wertheimer’s closest associates. From 1913
to 1920, Köhler was director of the Anthropoid Research Station on the island ofTenerife, which is in the Canary Islands off the coast of Northwest Africa. He hadintended to stay in Tenerife for only a short while. With the outbreak of World War I,however, he was unable to leave for several years. While in Tenerife, Köhler conducted

rooms where bunches of bananas were placed just out of the chimpanzees’ reach andthen watched how they solved the problem of reaching the bananas.
Although not all chimpanzees were able to successfully solve the problem—evi-
dently chimpanzees, like human beings, vary in their intelligence—those that did soexhibited similar behavior. For one, they would often try to reach the bananas simplyby jumping or reaching for them. Upon failing to grasp the bananas, they would oftenshow frustration, screaming, or kicking the walls of the room. Eventually, after survey-ing the entire room, they would suddenly derive a solution involving the use of nearbyobjects as tools. One chimp might drag a box under the bananas and then climb on topof it to reach them. Some chimps stacked multiple boxes to attain their goal. Anothermight put two sticks together to create a stick long enough to reach the food.
What did these studies show?
These studies showed two things. For one, the animals arrived at their solutions onlyafter surveying the entire environment. They did not just focus on a single object buttook the entire field into account. Secondly, the problem was not solved through trial
and error via rewards and punishments as the behaviorists would have predicted.Instead the animal arrived at a complete solution all at once. In other words, thechimps did not solve problems in a piecemeal fashion, but rather in a holistic way.Köhler referred to this holistic form of problem solving as insight learning.
How did Wolfgang Köhler study insight learning using apes?
Wolfgang Köhler (1887–1967) conducted a famous series of studies on chimpanzees’methods of problem solving. He placed a bunch of bananas just out of the animals’reach and then watched how they figured out how to get to the bananas.

There has been controversy regarding Köhler’s stay in the Canary Islands duringWorld War I. A number of people, specifically British intelligence agents,

Evidently they were not convinced that his fascina-tion with chimpanzees and bananas was sufficient explanation of his presence.Some contemporary writers still believe the issue is unsettled although no evidencehas been produced that proves he was anything more than a Gestalt psychologist.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 44chimpanzee put two sticks together to create a tool long enough to reach the bananas.
Another chimp stacked three boxes on top of each other to reach the fruit hangingfrom the ceiling. Besides showing us the remarkable ingenuity of these animals, thiswork supported the Gestalt notion that the mind actively creates complete solutionsto problems. This is in contrast to the behaviorist assumption that problem solvingcan only proceed piecemeal by trial and error.
What is the difference between Gestalt psychology and Gestalt psychotherapy ?
Gestalt therapy, a school of psychotherapy founded by Fritz Perls in the 1940s, iscompletely distinct from Gestalt psychology , the body of research and theory derived
from Max Wertheimer’s experiments with perception. Gestalt therapy is commonlyconsidered part of humanistic psychology and incorporates principles from the philo-sophical schools of phenomenology and existentialism as well as psychoanalysis andGestalt psychology.
PSYCHOANALYTIC THEORY
What is psychoanalytic theory?
While behaviorism dominated American academic psychology throughout the firsthalf of the twentieth century, psychoanalysis dominated clinical psychology—thestudy of abnormal psychology—during the same period both in Europe and the Unit-
ed States. Psychoanalysis was so prominent because it provided a comprehensive theo-ry of psychopathology and a psychological method of treating mental distress. It is fairto say that most, if not all, subsequent theories of psychopathology and psychotherapyowe an enormous debt to psychoanalysis.
Although many schools of psychotherapy were formed in reaction against psycho-
analysis, they were still defined in response to it and therefore must be seen as its
descendants. Psychoanalytic theory actually includes a broad range of theoretical writ-ing, starting with Sigmund Freud’s original contributions in the late nineteenth cen-tury. Since Freud, psychoanalysis has broken into numerous schools including egopsychology, interpersonal psychoanalysis and the object relations school, all of whichdeveloped in the mid-twentieth century. More recent schools include self psychologyand relational theory.
Did Freud change his theory over time?
Freud changed his theories several times over the course of his long career. He initial-ly proposed the seduction theory to explain hysteria, a common disorder of the latenineteenth century involving physical complaints without an actual physical basis.
45MAJOR MOVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGYHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 45The seduction theory posited that hysteria resulted from early sexual experience, what
we would now call childhood sexual abuse. This explanation was abandoned in the late1890s, however, and Freud focused instead on unconscious sexual fantasy. In otherwords, the symptoms were caused by the patient’s disguised wishes rather than mem-ories of real events. Freud also moved from a topological theory, focusing on the rela-
tionship between conscious and unconscious processes to a structural model, focused
on the id, ego, and superego. Finally, in the 1920s Freud added the instinctual force ofThanatos, the death instinct, to his theory of instincts.
What is Freud’s topological model?
In Freud’s topological model, the mind is divided into three sections, the unconscious,the pre-conscious and the conscious. In the unconscious, the individual is not aware
of the contents of the mind. Here forbidden and dangerous wishes reside, safely out ofawareness. In the pre-conscious, mental content is capable of entering into conscious-ness but is not currently there. There is no block between conscious and pre-con-scious as there is between the conscious and the unconscious. The conscious part ofthe mind contains all the mental content that is in our awareness. It is very smallcompared to the unconscious.
What is the structural model?
The structural model overshadowed the topological model’s focus on the con-scious/unconscious division of the mind. While Freud still believed in unconsciousprocesses, he became more and more interested in the compartmentalization of the mindinto the id, ego, and superego . The id, translated literally as “the it”, contains the animal-
istic passions that must be subdued in order for civilization to function. The id works onthe pleasure principle, where wish equals reality and desire is not subject to restraint. Theego, Latin for “the I,” mediates between the id and reality. The ego operates on the realityprinciple and recognizes that the world does not always obey our desires. The superego isthe source of our morality. It is formed through our internalization of our parents’ rulesand discipline. A strict superego results in inhibited, moralistic behavior. A weak super-ego results in self-indulgent, poorly disciplined, or immoral behavior.
What is Freud’s theory of libido?
Throughout his career Freud maintained a theory of libido as the primary motivatingforce behind all human behavior. In fact, he parted ways with some of his favorite pro-tégées after they proposed competing theories about human motivation. Libido can beloosely translated as the sexual instinct, but really refers to all aspects of sensual plea-sure. In Freud’s view, instincts press for release as part of the pleasure principle. Plea-sure is only attained when tension is reduced through release of instinctual energy. Ifthe instinct is blocked from release, it will seek another outlet, much like a river run-
46Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 46ning downstream. This mechanistic view of human motivation was called the
hydraulic model and reflects the scientific models of the day.
What did Freud say about Thanatos, the death instinct?
Following the carnage of World War I, Freud added Thanatos to his theory of instincts.Thanatos, the death instinct, explains human destructiveness. Because pleasure canonly be found through the reduction of tension, there must be a drive to reach a stateof total quiescence, a state of no tension at all. This is the equivalent of death, hencethe death instinct. We now realize that pleasure comes from the build-up of tension aswell the release of tension.
Why was Freud so focused on sex?
While the focus on sex may seem odd to modern eyes, it is important to considerFreud in the context of his own time. He was an extremely ambitious man who aimedto build an all-encompassing scientific theory to explain human behavior. In keepingwith nineteenth-century mechanics, he looked for one single force that could explainall of human behavior. He was also a product of the Victorian period—a prudish, sexu-ally inhibited time when sexual repression in the European upper middle-class wasprobably rampant. It is possible that many of the psychological symptoms his femaleclients exhibited truly were related to repressed sexuality. Over time, however, much

translated into emotional and interpersonal terms.
What is the Oedipal period?
Freud believed that the libidinal instincts moved through a series of developmentalstages, corresponding with different erogenous zones at different ages. In the phallicstage (approximately ages four to seven), the little boy goes through the Oedipal crisis,which results in the formation of his super-ego. Around this age, the little boy falls inlove with his mother. Recognizing his father as his rival, he feels murderous ragetoward his father, controlled only by his fear of his father’s greater strength. His fearthat his father will cut off his penis in retaliation is termed castration anxiety.
As a solution to this dilemma, the little boy identifies with his father, realizing
that he will grow up to be a man just like him and then have a wife all his own. Thisinternalization of the father and the father’s authority is seen to be the foundation ofthe super-ego and of a boy’s moral development. Freud was not as sure how to accountfor female moral development and assumed women to have weaker super-egos due totheir obvious immunity to castration anxiety. While the specifics of this theory havebeen roundly criticized by feminists and developmental psychologists alike, Oedipalbehavior is often observed in children this age, who can show strikingly romanticbehavior to older relatives of the opposite sex.
How is Freudian theory seen today?
Since the inception of psychoanalysis, Freud has always had passionate loyalists anddetractors. Psychoanalysis has been trashed as all hocus-pocus; Freud’s writings havealso been treasured as the bible and seen as infallible. To some extent this is still thecase today. However, many advances in our understanding of behavior and of the brainhave shown that Freud was often onto something, although he was wrong in many ofthe specifics. Modern neuroscience, for example, has revealed the frontal lobe and thelimbic system to function dramatically similarly to the ego and the id.
48What about Freud’s own Oedipal complex?
We can question whether the particular configuration of Freud’s own familymade him especially sensitive to Oedipal issues. Twenty years separated
Freud’s parents, Amalia and Jacob, the same age difference between Freud andhis mother. Freud was his mother’s (but not his father’s) first born and by manyaccounts had a particularly close and intense relationship with her throughouthis whole life. She died at age 95, only nine years before her son died.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 48How has psychoanalytic theory changed over the years?
There have been many developments in psychoanalysis. In contemporary psychoanaly-
sis, the schools of object relations, self psychology, and relational theory have translat-ed Freud’s original ideas into interpersonal terms. The emphasis has shifted from sex-ual instincts to consideration of how early childhood relationships affect adults’capacity to relate to others and manage emotions. Principles from attachment theoryand ideas about self-reflective functioning (as found in the work of Peter Fonagy andMary Target) have also informed contemporary psychoanalysis. Arguably, the integra-tion of psychoanalytic concepts with advances in neuroscience currently forms thecutting edge of psychoanalytic theory.
JUNGIAN ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
Who was Carl Jung?
The Swiss psychiatrist Carl Gustave Jung (1875–1961) was one of Freud’s closest col-laborators until he broke off to form his own school of analytical psychology. Whileclearly grounded in Freudian psycho-analysis, Jungian analytical psychologymoves away from the dominance of libidoand toward a mystical understanding ofthe human unconscious. Interestingly,Jung came from a long line of clergymen.His father was a minister in the SwissReformed Church.
Fairly early in his career, Jung
worked in Zurich at the renownedBurghölzli clinic under Eugen Bleuler,a prominent psychiatrist and the origi-nator of the term “schizophrenia.” HereJung became involved in research withword association, detecting uncon-scious meaning through the way peoplegrouped words together. This work ledhim to Freud’s psychoanalytic researchand the two men met in 1907.

from Freudian psychoanalysis.
What was Jung’s relationship with Freud ?
Jung was a favorite protégé of Freud until they broke off their relationship over doc-
trine. Jung rose quickly within the psychoanalytic world, becoming editor of a psycho-analytic journal and president of the International Psychoanalytic Association. Freudfavored him in part because as a non-Jew, he offered a bridge to the wider non-Jewishscientific community in Europe. Jung’s relationship with Eugen Bleuler also offeredthe promise of greater scientific respect for psychoanalysis, which was somethingFreud craved. Jung grew increasingly uncomfortable, however, with Freud’s insistenceon sexuality as the sole motivating force. He agreed with Freud’s energy-based con-ception of psychological motivation—that normal and abnormal psychologicalprocesses were a product of energy flow—but he believed sexuality to form only asmall part of human motivation.
Temperamentally, the two men differed as well. Jung had a mystical bent, nur-
tured perhaps through his family’s religious heritage, and a life-long interest in theoccult. Freud was a fervent rationalist, believing religion to be little more than aninfantile form of neurosis. It is unlikely Freud would have had much respect for theoccult either, except perhaps as clinical material.
How did Jung’s view of the unconscious differ from Freud’s?
Like Freud, Jung believed the mind was divided into the conscious and unconsciousparts and that the conscious part comprised a small fraction of the total psyche. Jungalso believed, like Freud, that repressed and forbidden ideas were banished to theunconscious, intentionally kept out of consciousness. Unlike Freud, however, Jung
50Why was Carl Jung interested
in the Eastern practice of creating mandalas?
Mandalas are religious artworks created by Buddhist and Hindu monks. Jungwas strongly attracted to Eastern religions and viewed the mandala as a
symbol of the personality. For Jung and his followers, the structure of the man-dala, with its four corners bound to a central circle, represents the path of per-sonal development. In our personal growth, we strive to unite the opposingforces of our personality (the four corners) into a comprehensive, all-inclusive,self-awareness (the central circle). To gain this awareness, we must turn inward,just as the outer corners of mandala point inward toward the circle.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 5051MAJOR MOVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGY
Mandalas are religious designs used in the Hindu and Buddhist traditions ( Fortean Picture Library ).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 51divided the unconscious into the personal unconscious and the collective unconscious.
The personal unconscious contained personal experiences that had slipped out of con-
sciousness, due either to simple forgetting or repression. The contents of the personalunconscious came from the individual’s life experience. The collective unconscious,however, held the entire, evolutionary heritage of humanity. It contained the entirelibrary of our typical reactions to universal human situations. It was not limited to theindividual’s life but encompassed the great, impersonal truths of existence.
What are the personality traits that guide our conscious awareness?
Jung developed a typology of personality traits that has had wide influence on person-ality psychology. He divided the conscious mind into both functional modes and atti-tudes toward the world. The functional types refer to ways that people process infor-mation. Believing the mind to be composed of opposites in continual tension witheach other, he proposed two polarities, thinking vs. feeling and intuition vs. sensation.
Each polarity was mutually exclusive from the other one. You could not process theworld through feeling and through thinking at the same time. One side of the polaritywas always dominant, the other relegated back to the unconscious. Extroversion vs.
introversion described the attitude toward the outside world. The extrovert attends
primarily to external reality, to other people and objects. The introvert is turnedinward, preoccupied with internal, subjective experience.
What personality tests are derived from Jung’s theory of personality?
The Meyers-Briggs test is a well known personality test that is often used in the work-place to identify employees’ different personality styles. This test uses all three polari-ties mentioned above, extroversion vs. introversion, thinking vs. feeling, intuition vs.sensation, and adds one more, judgment vs. perception. Extroversion is also measuredon scales associated with the Five Factor Model of personality, such as the NEO per-sonality inventory. This test, formulated to identify dimensions of personality in non-pathological adults, uses 240 items to quantify five areas: neuroticism, extroversion,openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness.
What are archetypes?
Archetypes are patterns of experience and behavior that reflect ancient and funda-
mental ways of dealing with universal life situations. Archetypes reside in the collec-tive unconscious. There is a mother archetype, a child archetype, an archetype of thefeminine, of the masculine, and many more. Archetypes can never be directly knownin consciousness but can only be glimpsed through the images that float up from ourunconscious in dreams, creative works of art, mythology, and even religious symbol-ism. Through interpretation of this visual symbolism, we gain greater knowledge ofour deepest selves.

What is humanistic psychology ?
Humanistic psychology refers to a group of psychological theories and practices that
originated in the 1950s and became very popular in subsequent decades. Similar tothe Gestalt psychologists, the humanistic psychologists reacted against the con-straints of the dominant psychological schools of their time but the humanistic psy-chologists had better timing. They arrived on the scene just as the dominance ofbehaviorism and psychoanalysis was beginning to fade. In fairly short order, theybecame powerful counterpoints to the orthodoxies of both schools.
In general, humanistic psychologists wanted to inject humanity back into the
study of human beings. More specifically, they objected to a mechanical view of psy-chology, to the portrayal of human beings as passive objects at the mercy of eitherstimulus-response chains or unconscious drives. They insisted that people are activeparticipants in their own lives. Humanists emphasized free will and the importance ofchoice. They also valued the richness of subjective experience and concerned them-selves with the qualities of lived experience, of human consciousness.
Finally, they challenged the emphasis on pathology in psychoanalysis. In contrast to
Freud, they believed that people are inherently motivated toward psychological growthand will naturally move toward health with proper encouragement and support.

What was Jung’s relationship with mysticism?
Jung was always drawn to mysticism and late in life he traveled extensively tolearn about the spiritual practices of other cultures. He visited the Pueblo
Indians in New Mexico, he traveled to Kenya and India and he collaborated onstudies of various Eastern religions. He viewed the symbolism in all the religioustraditions as expressions of universal archetypes. Jung’s view of mental healthwas also religiously tinged. Our happiness is dependent upon our communionwith a universal reality that is part of us but yet larger than us. In his concept ofthe collective unconscious, he combined psychology, evolutionary biology, andthe spiritual traditions of many diverse cultures.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 53senseless slaughter? The philosophical movement of Existentialism came out of these
circumstances and provided a backdrop for the humanistic psychologists. Phenome-nology, an earlier branch of European philosophy, also influenced the humanistic psy-chologists with its focus on the rich complexity of subjective experience. With regardto psychological schools, the functionalism of William James also played a role, as didthe holistic theories of the Gestalt psychologists.
What is meant by third force psychology?
In 1950s America, where humanistic psychology originated, the field of psychologywas dominated by the twin giants of behaviorism and psychoanalysis. Behaviorismdominated academic psychology and psychoanalysis dominated clinical psychology.Humanistic psychologists wanted to create an alternative to these two great forces: a
third force in psychology.
Who was Abraham Maslow ?
The American psychologist Abraham Maslow (1908–1970) was one of the foundingfathers of humanistic psychology. Maslow wrote a number of books and also madeseveral important theoretical contributions. He is perhaps best known for his con-cept of the hierarchy of needs. Maslow believed that human psychological needs aremultidimensional and that there is no single motivating force to explain all of humanbehavior. He believed these needs could be organized hierarchically with the mostfundamental needs related to biological survival. Once our fundamental biologicalneeds—such as thirst, hunger, and warmth—are met, our needs for safety comeinto play. Following satisfaction of safety needs, psychological needs for emotionalbonds with other people become important. Once those are met, we become con-cerned with self-esteem and the need to feel recognized and valued in a community.
Finally, after all these more basic needsare met, we encounter the need for selfactualization, a kind of creative fulfill-ment of our human potential.
What did Maslow mean by
self-actualization?
Although Maslow was not the first to usethe term self-actualization, his name ismost frequently associated with it. Self-
actualization refers to a state of full self-
expression, where one’s creative, emo-tional, and intellectual potential is fullyrealized. We recognize what we need to
54
 This triangle illustrates Maslow’s hierarchy of needs.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 54feel fully alive and we commit ourselves to its pursuit. Although Maslow was criticized
for promoting what was seen as a selfish pursuit of pleasure, he stressed that it is onlythrough development of our truest selves that we attain full compassion for others. Inhis view, self actualized people make the strongest leaders and the greatest contribu-tions to society. This concept illustrates humanistic psychology’s concern with person-al growth and psychological health in contrast to psychoanalysis’ emphasis on psy-chopathology and mental illness.
What did Maslow mean by peak experiences?
A peak experience occurs in a state of total awareness and concentration, in which the
world is understood as a unified, integrated whole where all is connected and no onepart is more important than another. This is an awe-filled and ecstatic experience,which is frequently described in religious or mystical terms. It is not simply a rose-colored distortion of life, however, where all evil and tragedy is denied. Rather it is amoment of full comprehension, where good and evil are fully accepted as a part of acomplete whole. Like William James and Carl Jung before him, Maslow believed themystical and ecstatic aspects of religion were proper subjects of psychological study.
What is the difference between D-love and B-love?
Maslow also distinguished between two different kinds of love. D-love or deficiency-love
refers to a kind of grasping, possessive love. In this state, we cling to the loved one outof desperate dependency and see the loved one as a means to fill come kind of deficien-cy in ourselves. B-love, or being-love, reflects a love based on full acceptance of theother person. In B-love, we love other people simply for who they are and not for whatthey can do for us. Naturally, B-love is seen as the healthier and more sustainable kindof love. Maslow was very focused on the importance of rising above selfish desires inorder to embrace other people for their own sake rather than as means to a goal. Inter-estingly, Maslow described his own mother as an extremely disturbed woman who wasincapable of valuing anyone for any reason outside her own personal agenda.
What impact did humanistic psychology have on the practice of psychotherapy?
A number of schools of psychotherapy came out of the humanistic movement andmany more were influenced by it. Carl Rogers’s person-centered psychotherapy, FritzPerls’s Gestalt therapy (named after Gestalt psychology but more closely tied tohumanistic psychology), Victor Frankl’s logotherapy, and Rollo May’s existential psy-choanalysis are all children of humanistic psychology.
Who was Carl Rogers?
Carl Rogers (1902–1987), another key figure in humanistic psychology, has had enor-mous influence on the practice of psychotherapy. His school of person-centered psy-
55MAJOR MOVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGYHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 55chotherapy, originally known as client-centered psychotherapy (and often simply
referred to as Rogerian therapy), placed the client’s subjective experience at the fore-front of the therapy. He believed the therapist’s role was less to untangle psy-chopathology than to promote the client’s personal growth through empathic listen-ing and unconditional positive regard. While Rogers has been criticized for a relativedisregard of negative emotions and interpersonal conflict, therapeutic empathy is
now universally recognized as an essential ingredient of psychotherapy.
What did Rogers mean by unconditional positive regard ?
Rogers made a distinction between loving a child for his or her intrinsic worth andloving the child dependent upon some condition: “I will love you if you are a good stu-dent, beautiful, obedient,” etc. Children who feel loved unconditionally grow up tohave faith in their own intrinsic worth. In contrast, children who experienced theirparents’ love as conditional, as contingent on some kind of performance, will oftensuffer long-lasting damage to their sense of self. These notions are similar to Maslow’sconcepts of B-love and D-love.
What contributions to psychotherapy research did Carl Rogers make?
Rogers was a pioneer in the scientific investigation of psychotherapy. He believed themethods of empirical research could and should be applied to the practice of psy-chotherapy. He was the first to record psychotherapy sessions despite vehement oppo-sition from the psychoanalysts who believed the privacy of the therapy hour shouldnever be violated. Rogers also systematically measured improvement by administeringpsychological tests pre-and post-treatment and then compared the results of subjectsin therapy with those in a control group. These methods became fundamental tools inpsychotherapy research, which has since blossomed into a discipline all its own.
ATTACHMENT THEORY
What is attachment theory?
Attachment theory was one of the first movements to provide empirical support forthe key concepts of psychoanalytic theory, specifically that early childhood relation-ships with caregivers have profound impact on later personality development. Similarto Carl Rogers, attachment theorists believed that scientific methods could be usefullyapplied to the study of emotional and interpersonal phenomena. Thus attachment the-ory was the first movement to bring scientific methods to bear on psychoanalyticideas. Not surprisingly, this occasioned resistance at first but over time attachmenttheory has been accepted by most psychoanalytic schools.
56Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 56Attachment refers to a biologically based drive in the child to form an enduring
emotional bond with the caregiver, generally the mother. Attachment theory originat-
ed with John Bowlby who wrote a trilogy of books entitled Attachment and Loss(1969, 1973, 1980). Bowlby’s theory was greatly expanded by Mary Ainsworth (1913–1999), who developed an experimental procedure to study attachment. It was MaryAinsworth who put attachment theory into the lab.
Who was John Bowlby ?
John Bowlby (1907–1990) was a British psychoanalyst who became concerned with thedevastating impact of early mother-child separations, which he frequently witnessedwhen working in post-World War II England. Disturbed by the dismissal of real-lifeevents in the psychoanalytic world view, Bowlby’s insistence on the real-time influenceof the mother’s presence often put him at odds with his colleagues. Bowlby was alsointerested in ethology, the study of animal behavior, and eventually synthesized bothpsychoanalytic theory and ethology into his theory of infant-mother attachment.
What was John Bowlby’s concept
of attachment?
Generally, attachment is seen as a bio-
logically-based, evolutionarily adaptivedrive for the infant to seek protectionfrom the mother. When the child isfrightened or is separated from themother, the attachment system is acti-
vated and the child will seek proximityor physical closeness to the mother. Thechild will reach toward the mother, cryto be picked up, or crawl close to themother. In Bowlby’s view, the child ismotivated to attain a sense of felt securi-ty, a subjective experience of safety andwell-being–perhaps a kind of cozy con-tentment. When the child feels secure,the attachment system is deactivatedand the exploratory system is turned on.
At these points, the child will ventureaway from the mother to explore theworld, to play. If the relationship withthe mother is disrupted through separa-tion or loss, the child will experience

depending on the severity of the loss.
What was Bowlby’s concept of the internal working model?
Although his description of the infant attachment system was largely behavioral,Bowlby addressed the psychological aspects of attachment through the notion of thechild’s internal working model of attachment. This is a kind of mental map or script of
the caregiver and the self. Through repeated attachment experiences, the child devel-ops expectations about the availability and responsiveness of the mother (or caregiv-er). The child develops a working model of how the mother-child interactions will playout and then modifies attachment behavior according to these expectations.
How did Mary Ainsworth create a scientific means to measure attachment?
Although John Bowlby was always interested in translating his concepts into empiri-cal research, his colleague Mary Ainsworth (1913–1999) is credited with taking attach-ment theory into the lab. While Bowlby had initially been interested in the universaleffect of mother-child separation, Ainsworth was interested in individual differences inthe quality of attachment based on the nature of the mother-child relationship. Herinitial research was in Uganda, where she had traveled with her husband in 1954. Byobserving twenty-eight Ugandan babies, she noted individual differences in the qualityof mother-infant attachment.
This research would be further developed in Baltimore at Johns Hopkins Universi-
ty, where she and her husband moved after leaving Uganda. Here she studied mother-child interactions both in their homes and in the laboratory during an experimentalprocedure she termed the strange situation . Based on the child’s responses to separa-
tions and reunions with the mother, the child could be classified into secure and inse-cure attachment categories. Ainsworth also found that attachment status in the labcorrelated with the mother’s behavior toward the child in the home. Ainsworth’s pub-lication of this data in her 1978 book Patterns of Attachment was a milestone in
attachment research. This fairly simple experimental paradigm would dramaticallychange psychological research into child development.
What is the strange situation and what does it show?
The strange situation is a twenty-minute procedure in which infants of twelve to eighteenmonths and their mothers are introduced to a room full of toys attached to an observationroom by a one-way mirror. A sequence of separations and reunions follow. There are eightepisodes to the strange situation, the first lasting only thirty seconds and the rest up tothree minutes. The baby’s reactions during the two separation and reunion episodes arecarefully observed through the one-way mirror. Based mainly on these behaviors, the babyis classified as either securely attached or into one of three insecurely attached categories.
58Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 58What does it mean to be securely attached?
A securely attached child (B baby in Ainsworth’s system) showed interest in the toys
when the mother was in the room. Some but not all babies showed mild to moderatedistress in the separation episodes. Most importantly, in the reunion episodes, thechild directly sought out contact with the mother. If the child was distressed after theseparation, contact with the mother was effective in soothing the child. This pattern ofbehavior is seen to reflect the child’s felt security in the mother’s availability and
responsivity to the child’s attachment needs.
What does it mean to be insecurely attached?
A child who is insecurely attached is viewed as feeling insecure about the mother’s
emotional availability or responsivity to the child’s attachment cues. The child thenmodifies his or her attachment behavior to adapt to the mother’s behavior. There areseveral categories of insecure attachment. Ainsworth originally proposed two cate-gories, avoidant and resistant attachment, but another category, disorganized attach-ment, was added later.
What are the ways that insecure attachment manifests?
Avoidant children, whom Ainsworth originally classified as A babies, show overly inde-pendent behavior. They tend to show more interest in the toys than their mother andlittle distress during the separation. Most importantly, they turn away from theirmother upon reunion; hence they are avoidant . Resistant babies (or C babies) may be
seen as overly dependent. They are less likely to engage with the toys when with theirmother is present and may show great distress upon separation. Upon reunion, theyshow proximity-seeking behavior with the mother (crying, reaching, etc.) but alsoresist the mothers’ attempts to soothe them. They may push their mothers away, arch
their backs when picked up, or angrily kick their mothers. While avoidant and resis-tant classifications are considered a variant of normal attachment, disorganizedattachment is more likely to be found in children who are victims of abusive or other-wise pathological parenting. These children do not show a consistent strategy of deal-ing with attachment and may even show fear toward their parent.
Are insecurely attached children less attached to their parents than are
securely attached children?
No. Biology ensures that all children are powerfully attached to their caregivers. Thereis no choice in this matter. Children vary in the security of their attachment, which
basically means how safe they feel in their relationship with their attachment figure,how secure they are that their caregiver will respond to their needs. But this does notmean they vary with regard to the power of their attachment to their caregivers.
59MAJOR MOVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGYHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 59What kind of parenting results in securely attached babies?
In Ainsworth’s sample, securely attached children were more likely to have mothers
who were reliably sensitive and responsive to the child’s cues as measured in the home
environment. Mothers who were more sensitive to their infants during feeding, play,physical contact, and episodes of emotional distress in the first three months of lifewere more likely to have securely attached infants at twelve months.
What kind of parenting results in insecurely attached babies?
Mothers of avoidant babies were shown to be reliably unresponsive to the babies’ cues
in Ainsworth’s home studies. Avoidant attachment behavior is considered to reflect adown regulation of attachment in response to a reliably unresponsive mother. Moth-ers of resistant babies were found to be unreliably responsive to the child’s attach-
ment cues in the home setting. Thus resistant attachment may be seen as a strategy tomaximize their mother’s attention by ratcheting up their attachment system. Disorga-nized attachment is more often found in children who have been abused or whosemothers have significant emotional pathology. These babies cannot find a consistentstrategy to deal with their parents’ erratic or even frightening behavior. Thus theirattachment behavior is disorganized.
60
The way mothers respond to their babies’ emotional cues affects the quality of the infants’ attachment. Parents of securely att ached
infants are reliably and sensitively responsive to the child’s emotional communications. Parents of insecurely attached children fail to
respond sensitively to their children’s emotional cues or at least do so inconsistently ( iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 60How might the principles of behaviorism apply to attachment theory?
The three major attachment classifications, secure, insecure-avoidant, and insecure-
resistant, can be seen to reflect predictable responses to different reinforcementschedules. They can be explained by the laws of operant conditioning. Avoidant attach-ment reflects the extinction of attachment-seeking behavior after these behaviors
have consistently failed to elicit a response from the mother. The children in effectgive up on the mother’s response. Resistant attachment reflects the opposite pattern,in which there is an increase of behavior in response to an intermittent reinforcement
schedule. The child learns to crank up the attachment behaviors in order to maximizethe likelihood of the desired response from the mother. Secure attachment reflects aconsistent reinforcement schedule. The child has learned that attachment-seekingbehaviors will be consistently and predictably rewarded, so the child simply performsthem when needed and stops when they are no longer needed.
What implications does attachment style have for later child development?
Alan Sroufe and his colleagues conducted several studies looking at the impact ofattachment status on later childhood development. Children who were classified assecurely attached were more likely to have better relationships with peers and teachersin later childhood than those classified as insecure. Insecure-resistant children showedoverly dependent behavior with teachers while insecure-avoidant behavior showedoverly independent behavior. These children were less likely to seek help from teacherswhen problem solving even if they could not solve the problems by themselves.
Is your attachment status fixed by the time you’re one year old?
Attachment research is sometimes interpreted as implying that personality is entirelyformed by the time that a child is one year old. Attachment strategies are conservative,that is they are resistant to change, but they are notfixed. If the family environment
remains stable and the parent-child interaction patterns do not change dramatically, itis likely that the child’s general approach to attachment will remain stable. On theother hand, if the family environment changes dramatically or if the parent chooses tochange his or her way of relating to the child, the child’s attachment status can change.
When is attachment status more likely to change?
Changes in parental circumstances can impact attachment status, either positively ornegatively. A single mother getting married or a father losing his job can make theparents more or less available to the child and thus impact the child’s attachment sta-tus. Studies of low income families show greater changes in children’s attachmentclassification over time than is found in middle-class families. This may be becauselower income families have less buffer against changes in the environment than dofamilies with greater financial means.
61MAJOR MOVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGYHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 61What is the adult attachment interview?
In order to study attachment in adults, Mary Main and colleagues developed a semi-
structured interview called the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI). A semi-structuredinterview provides specific questions as well as open-ended, follow-up questions.There is a script to follow but the interviewer can deviate from it to clarify informa-tion. The interview takes about an hour and a half and asks questions about the sub-ject’s childhood relationship with his or her parents. The way the subject talks aboutchildhood attachment is more important than what they say about their parents. Ofmost importance is the coherence of their narrative, specifically between theirabstract generalizations about their childhood attachment relationships (e.g., “Mymother was loving, involved.”) and the specific memories generated to illustrate thesegeneralizations (e.g., “I remember making chocolate chip cookies with her in ourkitchen.”). The narrative is coherent if the story makes sense; if it is riddled with con-tradictions, it is not coherent.
How can the three child attachment styles be mapped onto Mary Main’s three
adult attachment styles?
Main developed three attachment classifications to correspond with the three infantclassifications. She labeled them D,E, and F to match Ainsworth’s A, B, and C. Dismiss-ing adults (D) were hypothesized to correspond to avoidant babies (A); Enmeshed adults(E) to correspond to resistant babies (C); and Secure adults (F for Free) to correspondwith secure babies (B). The enmeshed classification was later changed to preoccupied.

Mary Main was interested in the way attachment status might manifest inadults. She recognized that quality of attachment could not be easily cap-
tured in behavior, as it could be with infants, but would have to be investigatedas an enduring part of personality. She built on Bowlby’s concept of internalworking models to consider the way adults represent attachment relations. A
representation is like a mental image or map of relationships. Main addressedquestions about attachment: How do adults think about and talk about attach-ment?

memories to back it up. The securely attached adult is much more coherent. Sheacknowledges contradictions and mixed emotions but can reflect objectively on therelationship. The preoccupied adult, in contrast, is flooded by her attachment-relatedmemories and is unable to integrate emotion and thought into a coherent narrative.
Dismissing
Interviewer: Could you tell me five adjectives that describe your childhood rela-
tionship with your mother?
Mother: Oh, I don’t know. I guess she was normal, she was fine. I guess she
was loving. She was practical and a good teacher.
Interviewer: Could you give me an example for each of those words?
Mother: Well, you know, she was always there. I don’t remember any prob-
lems or like anything that was really wrong. She was a good
teacher—she always wanted to make sure we got good grades.
Secure
Interviewer: Could you tell me five adjectives that describe your childhood rela-
tionship with your mother?
Mother: Hmm, that’s a little complicated. My mother was very warm and
very loving but she could also be controlling. So we had a veryclose relationship but it was also conflictual at times, especiallywhen I was a teenager.
Interviewer: Could you give me an example for each of those words?
Mother: I remember a lot of affection. I remember curling up with her on
the couch in the evenings, watching TV. But I also remember get-
ting in fights with her, more when I was older, when I wanted to goout with my friends. She would insist that I be home earlier thanany of my friends had to. Hmm, maybe she was just being responsi-ble, but at the time I thought she was unreasonable.
Preoccupied

tionship with your mother?
Mother: It was loving, absolutely, so loving. She was wonderful, fabulous.
But you know, sometimes she was really selfish, totally insensitive,like only out for herself.
Interviewer: Could you give me an example for each of those words?
Mother: It was unbelievable, you know. Whenever she got insecure, her
dander got up and she would just never listen to my side of things.
I think she had real problems with self-esteem. And all I wanted, all

her. Of course I did and still do and I know she loves me more thananything in the world. So that’s what makes it fabulous, just fabu-lous. It would destroy me if anything happened to her.
How do securely attached adults act?
Adults who are securely attached value attachment and can speak about attachmentrelationships with feeling but will also be thoughtful and reflective. They can takesome distance from their feelings and be reasonably objective about their experiences.On the AAI, secure adults give a coherent account of their childhood relationshipswith their parents and their generalized descriptions of the relationship are supportedby specific memories. In the same way that a securely attached child balances depen-dency and exploration, a securely attached adult balances emotion and thought.
What characterizes dismissing adults ?
A dismissing adult corresponds to an avoidant infant. Attachment is devalued and dis-missed by these adults with a concomitant emphasis on thought separated from emo-tion. An idealized picture of childhood attachment relationships is presented though itis not backed up by supporting memories. The adult may describe his or her mother as“fine, normal, and a good mother” but only provide memories such as “Well, you know,
64
Securely attached adults tend to be more sensitive to their infants’ emotional cues ( iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 64she was always there. She was just a normal mother.” The impression is of a cool, dis-
tant relationship with minimal recognition of the child’s emotional need for the parent.
How do preoccupied adults behave?
Preoccupied adults correspond to resistant infants. In contrast to dismissing adultswho attempt to minimize the effect of attachment, preoccupied adults cannot turntheir attention away from attachment; they are preoccupied with it. These adults are
flooded with memories of attachment relations but cannot take the distance necessaryto create a coherent, objective narrative. They provide contradictory, rapidly alternat-ing views of their attachment relationships (“She was loving, no she was really self-ish.”) accompanied by a gush of vivid memories (“I remember on my senior prom. It’salways about her. It was my night but she kept inserting herself. I wanted to wear myblue heels but she said they made my legs look fat.”) In this case emotion predomi-nates over rational thought.
Does a parent’s attachment style necessarily translate into a child’s
attachment style?
There is a strong relationship between security of attachment in parents and securityof attachment in their children. Secure adults are more likely to raise secure childrenand insecure adults are more likely to raise insecure children. However, the type ofinsecure attachment in adults is less strongly correlated with the type of insecureattachment in their children. Some dismissing mothers may have resistant childrenand some preoccupied mothers may have dismissing children.
What is self-reflective functioning and how does it relate to attachment?
Peter Fonagy and Mary Target have added to the attachment literature with their dualconcepts of self-reflective functioning and mentalization. They propose that security
of attachment in adulthood involves the capacity for self-reflective functioning, whichmeans the ability to reflect upon one’s emotional experiences in a thoughtful andcoherent way. The ability to mentalize emotional experiences involves the capacity to
represent one’s own and others’ mental experiences; that is, to understand and graspthe nature of emotional experience. In their view, the child’s security of attachment isnot only dependent on the mother’s sensitive behavior but also on her psychological
sensitivity. When the mother can keep her child’s subjective experience in mind, sheteaches the child that emotions both can be understood and communicated. Thechild’s development of self-reflective functioning is therefore dependent upon themother’s mentalization of the child’s experiences. Fonagy and Target have appliedthese concepts to their work with adults with severe personality disorders, many ofwhom sorely lack both self-reflective and mentalization abilities.

EVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY
What is sociobiology ?
By the final third of the twentieth century, evolutionary concepts were increasingly
penetrating psychological theories. For example, both attachment theory and Jung -
ian psychology borrow from evolutionary biology. The field of sociobiology explicitlyapplies the principles of evolutionary theory to the understanding of social behavior.This approach assumes that at least some part of social behavior is genetically basedand therefore has been acted upon by evolution. In other words, when a behavior hassurvived across thousands of generations, it most likely serves an evolutionary pur-pose. This approach was first applied to the study of non-human animals; it wasn’tuntil the 1970s that evolutionary theory was rigorously applied to the study ofhuman social behavior.
What is evolutionary psychology?
Evolutionary psychology is an outgrowth of sociobiology that focuses specifically onthe evolutionary roots of human behavior.
Who is Edward O. Wilson?
Edward O. Wilson (1929–) is considered the father of sociobiology. A professor of ento-mology (the study of insects) in the Harvard biology department since 1956, he hasmaintained a lifelong interest in the social behavior of animals. His original specialtywas the social life of ants. Wilson’s great contribution was to state that the evolution-ary explanation of animal behavior could be applied to the study of human behavior.He did not mean that culture and environment had no influence, only that our behav-ioral repertoire has its origins in our genetics and has been shaped by the processes ofnatural selection.
When he first published his classic text Sociobiology: The New Synthesis in 1975,
it was met with much resistance. To many people it was politically offensive because itseemed to dismiss the importance of environment. As with Eugenics and other earliermovements that proclaimed the heritability of human behavior, it seemed to endorsesocial inequality as the natural order of things. Over the last few decades, however,sociobiology and evolutionary psychology have become more widely accepted. Withadvances in brain imaging technology and other methods of studying biology, ourunderstanding of the biological underpinnings of human behavior has grown dramati-cally. Likewise, our appreciation of the complex interplay between genes and environ-ment has also advanced, so that it is now accepted that a focus on the genetic basis ofbehavior does not have to mean that environment is irrelevant.
66Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 66How is Darwinian evolution relevant
to psychology?
Darwinian evolution is the central
explanatory framework for all of biology.All of biological science is understoodwithin the context of evolution. Likewise,human beings are biological animals andour behavior is inextricably tied to ourbiology. Thus a clear understanding ofevolutionary principles is critical to theunderstanding of human psychology.
If our behavior is genetically
determined, where does learning
come in?
Both sociobiology and evolutionary psychology assume our behavior is grounded in our
genetics. Genetics determine the range of possible behaviors, the parameters of ourbehavior. Much of our behavior, however, simply cannot develop without extensive train-ing. For example, we cannot learn to read unless we are taught the necessary skills andunless we are exposed to reading materials. With the proper circumstances, our geneticmake-up allows us to learn to read. In contrast, no amount of training will ever lead a cat,
a dog, or a pigeon to read. Likewise, no amount of training will ever allow a human beingto fly (without artificial support). Thus genetics determine the potentiality of our behav-
ior but genetics alone cannot determine the specific outcomes for any given individual.
What is natural selection?
Natural selection refers to the effect of the natural environment on the likelihood thatgenetically based traits will be passed on from one generation to the next. The process goeslike this: First there must be variation in a particular trait within a population. Secondly,the trait must have some genetic basis. Thirdly, one version of the trait is better adapted to
the environment than another version. Consequently, the animals with the more adaptivetrait will bear more young, thus passing more of their genes onto the next generation.
Let’s consider the example of light and dark moths first recorded by Charles Dar-
win. There were two varieties of moths in England, light-colored moths and dark-col-ored moths. Originally, there were more light-colored moths than dark ones, as thedark ones stood out against the light-colored tree bark and were easy prey for the localbirds. At this point, light color was more adaptive than dark color.
During the Industrial Revolution in England, however, the trees became covered
with soot. This meant the dark-colored moths were better adapted to their environ-

ered tree bark. Now it was the light-colored moths that were easy prey for the birds.Hence, the population of dark-colored moths grew relative to the population of light-colored moths as more of the former survived to reproduce and pass their genes on tothe next generation. Thus natural selection acted on the moth population as a result
of their coloring. Of note, Darwin’s concept of natural selection does not explain howvariation in the population comes to be, only how one trait comes to be more frequentin the population than another trait.
How is reproductive success relevant to evolution?
Evolution occurs through the process of reproductive success. Those organisms that
pass their genes onto the next generation have succeeded; their genes and the traits 68Why was Charles Darwin such an influential figure in science?
Charles Darwin (1809–1882) is easily one of the most influential figures inmodern science. His theory of evolution has influenced every scientific disci-
pline involved with living organisms. Prior to the theory of evolution, the varietyof life on earth was seen as a product of God’s creation. All creation occurredaccording to the book of Genesis with no changes since. To suggest that animalshad changed over time implied that God’s creation was less than perfect. Thus thetheory of evolution challenged Christian theology about the very origins of life.
Because of this, Darwin’s theory was highly controversial in its day. In some
circles it remains so today. Scientifically, however, Darwin’s basic premises havenever been seriously challenged. Darwin was not the first proponent of a theoryof evolution. In fact, his grandfather Erasmus Darwin (1731–1802) contributedto early work on the subject. What was missing in Darwin’s day was an exactexplanation of the mechanism of evolution and appropriate supporting evidence.Darwin gathered evidence for his theory on his famous sea voyage on the H.M.S.Beagle in 1831, in which he traveled from England to the coast of Africa to the
southern tip of South America and back. It took him more than twenty years,though, to synthesize his observations into a coherent theory.
By the time Darwin published his famous essay “On the Origins of Species
by Means of Natural Selection” in 1859, the scientific community was ready toreceive it. It was an immediate sensation. Darwin’s theory of genetics, however,was not well developed. The monk Gregor Mendel did not publish his study ofpea plants until 1866 and his work was not appreciated until the beginning ofthe twentieth century. The current view of evolution reflects a synthesis of Dar-win’s theory of natural selection and Mendelian genetics.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 68associated with them have survived into the next generation. In evolution, success
really means survival. If a trait is common in a population, this means that the genesof previous generations with that trait have survived to the present.
What does evolutionary fitness mean?
Evolutionary fitness is the ability to pass on one’s genes to the next generation. If
there is a larger proportion of gene A in the present generation than in the previousone, then the organism with gene A has demonstrated evolutionary fitness. Converse-ly, if the proportion of gene B has decreased across generations, then the organismwith gene B has poor fitness.
How does evolution affect behavior?
We generally assume that animal behavior is adaptive, that it has evolved because itconfers fitness on the organism whose genetic make-up produces the behavior. Forexample, we assume that the mating dance of pigeons—in which they strut back andforth, jut their necks in and out and emit loud cooing noises—is adaptive. It increasesmale pigeons’ access to females and thus to reproductive success. This display behav-ior may make the male look bigger and stronger than he actually is. Females are morelikely to select such males as mates because selection of large and strong males mayconfer an evolutionary advantage for the females’ offspring. Male displays of strengthand size are very frequent strategies for access to females, evident in an extremelywide array of species, including our own. If we consider human males’ predilection formuscle cars and bodybuilding, we can see how the principles of sociobiology mightindeed be relevant to the behavior of humans.
What does survival of thefittest mean?
Survival of the fittest means that those individuals of a species with genetic traits that
are best adapted to the particular environment are most likely to mate and pass thosetraits on to the next generation. Importantly, survival of the fittest does not mean thatthe most aggressive and dominant will pass their genes on to the next generation.Dominance is one evolutionary strategy, but it is not the only one. For example, insome fish species, male fish can disguise themselves as females and then sneak intothe dominant male’s territory to mate with his females. In this case, fish that are notthe most dominant nevertheless reproduce successfully. Moreover, in many circum-stances, cooperation and altruism can be useful evolutionary strategies—as effective,if not more effective, than competition and aggression.
What is LaMarckian evolution?
Jean-Baptiste LaMarck (1744–1829) was a French biologist who contributed to pre-Darwinian theories of evolution. In keeping with the ideas of Charles Darwin’s grand-
69MAJOR MOVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGYHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 69father, Erasmus Darwin, LaMarck believed in the inheritance of acquired characteris-
tics. In other words, an animal adapts to the environment and these changes are then
passed onto the animal’s offspring via some form of heritability. Genetic change takesplace because of the animal’s behavior. The classic example involves the long neck ofthe giraffe. It was thought that giraffes stretched their own necks by reaching up toeat the leaves off the top of tall trees. This trait was then passed on to later genera-tions. Similarly, mountain goats grew a thicker coat in a cold climate and then passedthis trait onto their offspring.
Although LaMarckian evolution has a kind of intuitive appeal, there has never
been any evidence to support its central premise, that acquired behavior is directlycoded into the genes. In Darwinian evolution, genetic changes occur through randommutation. Some of these genetic mutations will improve the animal’s adaptation tothe environment, though most will not. Those genes that do improve adaptation aremore likely to be passed on to the next generation. Hence the environment influencesreproductive success but does not act upon the genes directly.
How do evolutionary theorists understand altruism?
Altruism, which involves helping others at some cost to the self, has long been a puz-zle to evolutionary theorists. How is altruistic behavior evolutionarily adaptive? It iscertainly common enough in the animal world. Worker bees and drones live theirentire lives in service to the queen bee. They do not even reproduce. Alarm calls arealso altruistic. When an animal sounds the alarm, warning others of the presence of apredator, the animal increases its visibility to the very predator it is warning against.
70What is Social Darwinism?
Social Darwinism refers to a loose group of theories that arose in the late nine-teenth and early twentieth centuries, following publication of Charles Dar-
win’s theory of evolution. This was a time of European imperialism, intenseimmigration into the United States, and growing masses of urbanized poor due tothe industrial revolution. Thus, social prejudices spread among the European andAmerican elite who convinced themselves that the conquered and the impover-ished were somehow deserving of their status. Likewise, the idea of survival of thefittest was used to justify this viewpoint. Darwin did not intend evolution to beracist or a justification of social inequity. His theory was an explanation of howanimals adapted to their environments. It was not a moral prescription for soci-ety. But his work was misinterpreted to mean that only the strongest and mostworthy will survive and that social disadvantage was a reflection of genetic inferi-ority. Galton’s theory of eugenics is a good example of Social Darwinism.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 70Likewise, altruistic behavior is wide-
spread in human beings. We give moneyto charity, take care of other people’schildren, and may even donate a kidneyto a relative in need.
Although altruistic behavior may
cost the individual animal, it may stillconfer reproductive success if it helpsother animals that share the same genes.Thus, we would expect altruistic behaviorto be most common among close rela-tives, which is universally the case. Whatis also found is that the cost and risk ofaltruistic behavior decreases as the bio-logical relationship grows more distant.Think about it. Most of us are willing todonate used clothes to children in anoth-er country. This is a low cost and low riskinvestment. But would you be willing to sell your house and donate the proceeds to acomplete stranger? Would you be willing to donate a kidney to a stranger? Or wouldyou be more likely to donate your kidney to your sister, especially if she was likely todie without it?
How do evolutionary theorists understand sexual behavior of males
and females?
Because sexual behavior has such direct impact on reproductive success, sociobiologistshave given a good deal of thought to the evolutionary significance of various forms ofsexual behavior. In many species, males and females may have different strategies forreproductive success. Females devote an enormous amount of time and energy to bear-ing and raising their young. The more complex the species, the more this is the case.
For example, humans, chimpanzees, and dogs provide much more maternal care
than turtles do. Therefore it is in the evolutionary interest of many females to be high-ly selective in their choice of mates and to seek males that can contribute to care ofthe young. Males, on the other hand, do not bear young and are not physically boundto the care of the young. They can develop a wide array of successful reproductivestrategies. They can inseminate a large number of females but give little resources tothe care of their offspring (e.g., buffalo, wildebeests), or they can inseminate fewerfemales, have more offspring with them and give much more time and energy to thecare of their young (e.g., trumpeter swans, gibbons). Some males (e.g., gorillas, furseals) compete for exclusive access to a group of females, devoting considerable energyto protecting their harems from encroachment from rival males.

Helping others when it in no way benefits oneself—such as
donating blood—is called altruism. Scientists, believing thatevolution has been based on self-preservation, have longwondered what the advantages could be of altruism ( iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 71Are men inherently polygamous ?
Across history, human males have exhibited all of the above reproductive strategies. They
are monogamous, promiscuous, or polygynous. Some even have harems. Whicheverstrategy is selected is dependent on numerous environmental contingencies, such aspopulation density, scarcity of resources, culture, religion, social status, etc. Whilehuman females are not immune to the temptations of multiple partners, polygamoussocieties with polygynous marital patterns (men with multiple wives) are far more com-
mon than those with polyandrous marital patterns (women with multiple husbands).
What is sexual selection?
Because females invest so much more energy into reproduction than males do,females are high-energy resources and hence very valuable to males. Consequentlymales are likely to evolve strategies to compete for them. Sexual selection means that
any physical trait or behavioral pattern that increases access to mates will be evolu-tionarily advantageous. Sexual selection is most pronounced in polygamous species,where a sort of winner-take-all system results in clear winners and losers.
One of the most common competitive strategies for males involves physical size
and strength. Across many, many species larger males have more offspring. Likewisedominant males can jealously guard access to multiple females, creating harems thatthey defend aggressively. However, in these circumstances non-dominant males willbe excluded from access to females. Therefore, the non-dominant males have devel-oped alternative strategies.
In several species, including stickle-
back fish, prairie chickens, and elephantseals, smaller and non-dominant malesdisguise themselves as females to gainaccess to the dominant males’ territoryand the females within. These strategieswork in direct male-to-male competition.But females are also often highly selec-tive. Males have to compete for femalefavor as well. It is likely elaborate displayrituals that are evident in many birdsreflect behaviors evolved to enhancefemale preference. Such rituals often dotwo things. They can advertise the males’size and strength, often in exaggeratedform. They can also attempt to persuadethe female of the resources the male canmake available for child rearing. Forexample, male scorpion flies give a high

In the competition for sexual partners, many species have
adapted in amazing biological and behavioral ways. Peacocks,for instance, have evolved so that they have stunning feathersto attract peahens. Humans, too, have developed their owncompetitive strategies ( iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 72calorie gift to their prospective mates. Female scorpion flies, in turn, prefer males who
make larger gifts. Perhaps the tendency for human males to buy women expensivejewelry and take them out to high-priced restaurants is a related phenomenon.
Do females compete for males?
Although male-to-male competition can be very dramatic in the animal world andconsequently has received more attention from sociobiologists, female-to-female com-petition certainly exists. Some female birds roll other females’ eggs out of the nest orotherwise interfere with their reproduction. In complex social groups, females cancompete for status. In large monkey troupes, for example, high-status females andtheir offspring have many advantages over lower status females. The presence ofmonogamy can also affect female-to-female competition.
Monogamy is more common when a prolonged or intensified period of depen-
dence in the young favors paternal investment in child rearing. When males aremonogamous, they are likely to be more selective in their choice of a mate as theyinvest more in each partner. Hence females may need to compete for males. In thesecases, females who show signs of greater reproductive fitness are often more success-ful in attracting males. We can certainly consider how this might apply to humanfemales, who characteristically spend considerable energy and time maintaining andenhancing their physical attractiveness to males. Across human cultures, the stan-dards for female beauty almost universally relate to youth and physical health, whichcorresponds to a long period of fertility.
If we consider the size of the beauty industry, which produces women’s makeup,
jewelry, clothing, skin creams, hair products, and many other forms of female adorn-ment, we can see how evolutionary pressures may be in play within our own culture.

So, is evolution only about competition?
Natural selection works on the comparative advantage of genetic traits. Per-
haps because of this, evolutionary theorists have tended to emphasize the
competitive nature of social relations. But this paints a very incomplete picture.Social behavior in all highly social animals involves much more cooperationthan competition or antagonism. If social life was entirely a Hobbesian free-for-all, there would be little reason for humans and other animals to seek each otherout. Just as evolution results in competitive and aggressive behavior, it alsoresults in the capacity for strong social bonds, parental devotion to children,affection, cooperation, empathy (in humans at least), and many other traits thatsupport cohesive social groups.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 73What are the controversies of sociobiology ?
Sociobiology was extremely controversial in its early days in the 1970s and 1980s. To say
that a behavior had a genetic basis seemed to imply that it was morally desirable orinevitable. Further, the emphasis on genetics was seen to invalidate the importance ofenvironment. We now know that environment and genetics interact in almost all ofhuman behavior. While genetics may set the outer limits of behavior, environment hashuge influence on the expression of behavior and even on the expression of genes them-selves. Genes can be turned on and off according to environmental influences. Thebiggest problem with evolutionary explanations of human behavior, however, involves theprofound difficulty distinguishing between proximate and ultimate levels of causation.
What is the difference between proximate and ultimate causation?
The ultimate level of causation refers to the behavior’s evolutionary significance; how
the behavior enhances reproductive fitness. The proximate cause refers to the imme-
diate cause of a behavior, whether that be hormonal, neurological, cognitive, inter-personal, or cultural. For example, the proximate cause of humans eating more cook-ies, cake, and ice cream involves the psychological tendency to desire and enjoy foodswith high sugar and fat content. The ultimate cause involves the high caloric contentof both sweet and high fat foods, which promotes physical survival in resource-scarceenvironments.
Such environments were typical until only just recently. However, distinguishing
between proximate and ultimate causes in human beings is extremely difficult, farmore difficult than it is in simple animals, like insects, whose behavior is much moreclosely tied to their genetics. This is because one of the most important evolutionarystrategies of human beings involves our remarkably developed intelligence. No otheranimal on earth can learn information of such complexity and modify its behavior insuch diverse ways. Therefore, due to our remarkable behavioral flexibility, it is verydifficult to distinguish what behavior is learned and what is genetically based.
How do scientists test the evolutionary significance of behavior?
In the absence of rigorous scientific research, sociobiologists can potentially fall backupon speculation, which can easily be biased by prevailing prejudices. Women are sup-posed to be subordinate to males; males are supposed to be aggressive. Therefore it is
critical that rigorous scientific research support any claims as to the evolutionary sig-nificance of human behavior.
Sociobiology relies on careful animal studies in which the frequency of any given
social behavior can be correlated with some marker of evolutionary significance. Forexample, the frequency of altruistic behavior in baboons can be correlated with thedegree of biological relatedness between animals, which will then translate into the
74Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 74proportion of shared genes (50 percent for parents and children, 50 percent for full
siblings, 25 percent for half siblings, 12.5 percent for cousins).
In humans, twin studies have been used to differentiate the effects of genetics
from the effects of environment. Additionally, anthropological studies that comparesocial behavior across different cultures are also used in an attempt to separate theeffects of genetics and environment. These studies become harder to do with time,however, as globalization leaves fewer cultures truly independent of each other.
How do twin studies help illuminate the role of genetics?
Twin studies have largely focused on IQ tests, comparing monozygotic (identical) anddizygotic (fraternal) twins. Monozygotic twins grew from the same fertilized egg andshare 100 percent of their genes. Dizygotic twins grew from two separate eggs andtherefore share only 50 percent of their genes. Twins reared together and twins rearedapart have also been compared. These studies show that intelligence does have a sig-nificant genetic component, as monozygotic twins score much more similarly on IQtests than do other types of siblings. However, these studies have been criticizedbecause while the percentage of genes that differ from one subject to another has beencarefully measured, the degree that environments differ between subjects is not clearat all. Moreover, there is considerable evidence showing that many environmental fac-tors, such as socio-economic status, years of education, and mother’s level of educa-tion also have very strong influences on IQ.

What are neurobiological theories of psychology?
Neurobiological theories of psychology investigate the links between the brain and the
mind. The assumption is that all psychological processes can be linked to specific pat-terns of brain activity and that understanding the neurobiological substrates of behav-
ior can only enhance our understanding of human psychology. With the remarkabletechnological advances of recent years, our ability to study the workings of the brainand its relationship to psychological processes has grown at an extremely rapid pace.
What is neuropsychology ?
Neuropsychology involves the study of specific psychological functions that can bedirectly linked to brain processes. Alexander Luria (1902–1977), one of the fathers ofneuropsychology, studied brain-injured soldiers in World War II to determine how dif-ferent kinds of brain damage impacted intellectual functioning. Modern neuropsycho-logical research helps identify the specific psychological functions that are associatedwith specific patterns of brain activity. For example the encoding of information intolong term memory is mediated by a brain area called the hippocampus.
How do neurobiological theories of psychology dovetail with
evolutionary psychology?
Animal models are a critical aspect of neurobiological research because, for obviousethical reasons, scientists can perform much more invasive procedures on animalbrains than on human brains. In fact the ethics of animal research is a controversialand difficult area. Studies of animal brains shed important light on the workings ofthe human brain but they also highlight the ways that brains differ across species.When the brains of various animal species are compared, we can generate hypothesesabout how our own brains developed across evolution. For example, the frontal lobe,which is associated with planning and other complex cognitive functions, is propor-tionately larger and more convoluted (providing more surface area) in animals withhigher intelligence. This suggests that the frontal lobe grew in size across human evo-lution as intelligence became an increasingly important evolutionary strategy.
How do advances in brain imaging technology affect neurobiological
theories of psychology?
Only a few decades ago, it was not possible to observe the human brain in action.Autopsies after death and neuropsychological studies of brain-injured patients werethe main methods of neurobiological research. With the advent of brain imaging tech-
76Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 76nology, however, it became possible to obtain snapshots of the living human brain.
Computerized tomography (CT scans) and magnetic resonance imagery (MRI) allowedpictures of brain anatomy. Positron emission tomography (PET) and single photonemission computed tomography (SPECT) scans allowed investigation of the actualworkings of the brain via recorded patterns of glucose uptake or blood flow.
More recently, functional MRI (fMRI) allows rapidly repeated images of brain
activity, permitting study of brain activity over time. In effect, brain imaging technolo-gy has moved from still photos to moving pictures. Moreover, subjects can be scannedwhile performing various actions, opening up an enormous array of research possibili-ties that will take many years to fully exploit.
COGNITIVE SCIENCE
What is cognitive science?
Cognitive science can be seen as an outgrowth of the cognitive revolution. Cognitive scien-tists use tools of evolutionary psychology, linguistics, computer science, philosophy, andneurobiology to investigate mental phenomena from a scientific vantage point. One of theaims of cognitive science is to create complex computer programs to model psychological

of a living brain, an extraordinary accomplishment possible only in the last few decades ( iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 77and brain processes. Cognitive scientists address a broad range of psychological problems
including memory, language, learning, and decision making. Theories of neural networks
address how the vast network of brain cells, or neurons, work together to create complexbehaviors. Out of these investigations, many remarkable technological innovations havedeveloped, including voice recognition software and advances in robotics.
What is artificial intelligence?
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a computer-based model of intellectual processes. AI scientistsbuild computer programs to simulate human intelligence. Their implicit assumption isthat psychology can be reduced to mathematical algorithms, the set of mathematical rulesfrom which computer programs are built. As of yet, AI has been restricted to relativelysimple aspects of human psychology, such as visual perception and object recognition.Nonetheless, AI models have become increasingly sophisticated and have taken on thecomplex problem of learning. How can a computer program modify itself in the face ofnew information? Pattern recognition software depends on a kind of teaching. The pro-grams are designed to respond to incoming feedback from the outside world. Responsesthat are reinforced are strengthened and those that are not reinforced are weakened. Inthis way, AI is similar to the both behaviorist and evolutionary models of psychology.
Can the mind be reduced to mathematical equations?
Computer models of human psychology are based on mathematical rules. It is a philo-sophical question whether the mind can ever be wholly explained by a finite set ofmathematical equations. A new branch of philosophy called neurophilosophy endorsesthis view while the holistic tradition of William James, the Gestalt theorists, and thehumanistic psychologists would argue that the whole is more than the sum of itsparts. As of now, there is no definitive answer to this question. Another controversyregarding cognitive science and artificial intelligence involves the concept of qualia.
This refers to the subjective quality of a mental process, the yellow of yellow, the sad-ness of sad. AI may well be able to model the neurological processes underlying theperception of the color yellow, but can it explain how these neuronal firing patternsproduce the experience of yellow? At present, we simply do not know the answer tothese fundamental philosophical questions.
PSYCHOLOGY AS A SCIENCE
What is the purpose of psychological research ?
Psychological research provides the absolute foundation of modern psychology. It is thebread and butter, the bricks and mortar, of the science of psychology. Research allows
78Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 78us to study the questions of psychology in a rigorous and systematic way so psychology
can be more than a collection of subjective opinions and anecdotal observations.
Is psychological research ever completely objective?
Arguably, no. Human behavior is too complex, and influenced by too many factors toever presume 100 percent certainty in our conclusions. Even the best studies dependto some extent on subjective judgments. Therefore we aim for the most rigorousmethods possible, accounting for possible confounds, biases, and limitations in ourresearch. That is also why we employ the peer review method for quality controlbefore publishing our studies in journals, so that other experts in the field can inde-pendently and anonymously review each paper. Empirical research is the most rigor-ous method we have but it is not a crystal ball. Luckily, the best way to refute erro-neous research is more research. Research can be used to correct its own mistakes.
What is a variable?
A variable is the building block of psychological research. It is the fundamental unit ofa study. Any trait or behavior that we wish to study is translated into a variable so thatwe can measure it with numbers. We use the term variable because we are studying
traits that vary across individuals or across time. If we want to study the relationship
between red hair and school achievement, we must first operationalize our traits of
interest, that is turn them into variables. We will code hair color as 1 = red hair, 0 =not red hair. We will operationalize school achievement by using grades, translating Athrough F into a 13-point scale, (A+ = 13, A = 12, A-= 11, B+ = 10, etc.). Having trans-lated our traits of interest into numerical variables, we can now use mathematics tocalculate the relationships between the variables. This, in effect, is the nuts and boltsof psychological science.
What are the major methods used in psychological research?
A number of different methods allow flexibility in the way we conduct psychologicalresearch. In experimental studies the variables are controlled and manipulated to
give the maximum precision to our observations. The drawback of such control isthat we cannot know how well the behavior observed in the artificially controlledenvironment will generalize to everyday life. In an observational study, we systemati-
cally observe behavior in its natural environment. We sacrifice a degree of controland precision for naturalism. Cross-sectional studies assess behavior at one point in
time. Longitudinal studies observe behavior over a period of time, sometimes over
decades. In quantitative studies , behavior is quantified into numbers. Even though
quantitative research is the most common form of psychological research, qualita-
tive research has gained more attention recently. This involves careful observation
without the use of numbers.
79MAJOR MOVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGYHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 79Do all psychological studies use numbers?
Most psychological studies are quantitative and rely on the translation of psychologi-
cal traits and behaviors into variables that can be analyzed statistically. Qualitativeresearch, however, also has a place in psychological research. In qualitative research asmaller number of subjects are observed or interviewed intensively. The observationsare recorded not in numbers but in a long, detailed narrative. From these narratives,the researcher identifies themes that can be explored with greater precision in laterquantitative research. Thus, qualitative research is hypothesis generating vs. hypothe-
sis testing. It is more broad-based and open-ended than quantitative research but lessprecise and reproducible. It is best understood as a preliminary type of research.
How do the methods of the social sciences differ from those of the hard sciences?
In general, the role of math is different in the social sciences than in the hard sci-ences. In the hard sciences, especially physics, mathematics is used to identify fixed
80How have laws changed to protect
people from abusive scientific experiments?
The history of scientific research with human subjects has been fraught withabuses. Examples abound, including the Nazis’ murderous experiments on
concentration camp victims and the infamous Tuskegee experiments of the1930s in which poor and uneducated African American men with syphilis weredeliberately deprived of available treatments.
Psychological research is not excluded from this disturbing history. Exam-
ples include Stanley Milgram’s work in the 1960s, in which subjects were falselyled to believe that they were causing pain, injury, and even death by administer-ing electric shocks to another person. John Watson’s treatment of Little Albertprovides another example.
Starting in the 1940s, a series of national and international laws were insti-
tuted to protect the rights of human subjects in research studies. In 1947 theNuremburg code laid down an international code of ethics regarding humanexperiments. In the 1960s, a series of laws was passed in the United States fur-ther developing these protections. The establishment of independent reviewboards to oversee the safety and ethics of human research in all Americanresearch institutions dates from this period.
Currently, Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) or Human Subjects Review
Committees must approve all studies conducted with human subjects. Most aca-demic journals require IRB approval of any study submitted for publication.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 80laws of nature. Once a mathematical equation is identified to explain the behavior of
an object, the equation can be used to predict the behavior of the object with extraor-dinary precision. Consider the equations that send rockets into space. Thus, mathe-matics in the hard sciences is predictive and deterministic .
All of the object’s behavior can be predicted by the equation. Aspects of modern
physics, such as quantum mechanics and Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle, do con-tradict this certainty, however, although only in the realm of the extremely small (e.g.the sub-atomic particles) or the extremely large. In psychology, the topics of study areso complex that it is not possible to predict all human behavior with mathematicalequations. Whether that will ever be possible is debatable, but it certainly has not beendone yet. What does that mean for the role of mathematics in psychological science?In psychology, mathematics is probabilistic . We estimate the likelihood that certain
statements are true or not. Further, these estimates are based on the aggregate, on thebehavior of groups. Therefore, while we may be able to say a lot about the likely behav-ior of groups, we are unable to predict the behavior of any given individual with cer-tainty. For example, based on samples showing increased beer drinking among malecollege students compared to females, we can predict that, in general, male collegestudents will drink more beer than females but we cannot predict the behavior of anygiven college student.
Why is sample selection important?
In psychological research, we try to draw conclusions about a larger population fromobservations of a small sample. We cannot study all male college students or all peoplewith schizophrenia so we study a sample of the population of interest and then try toapply our findings to the larger population. For this reason it is critical to make surethe sample is similar to the larger population. There are many ways the sample canvary from the larger population. The way we recruit our study subjects may bias thesample right from the start. For example, if you want to study illegal behavior, you arelikely to find your sample in the judicial system. Right off the bat your sample isbiased toward people who have been arrested, leaving out the people who never gotcaught. If you want to study people with depression, you are likely to study people inthe mental health system and your sample will be biased toward people who seektreatment. Because it is virtually impossible to remove all problems from sampleselection, researchers must carefully describe their samples so that the applicability toa larger population, or the study’s generalizeability, can be assessed.
What are statistics and how do they work?
Millions of psychology majors grit their teeth and roll their eyes at the very thought ofstatistics. Nonetheless, statistics are a fundamental part of psychological research.Statistics provide a mathematical technique to measure the relationships between two
81MAJOR MOVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGYHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 81or more variables (traits of interest such
as intelligence, aggression, or severity ofdepression). Statistics can show howthese variables relate. It can show thestrength of their relationship and theprobability that the relationships foundin a given study are likely to be true find-ings, rather than a statistical fluke, i.e.,due to chance. The most common statis-tics are measures of central tendencies,specifically: the mean, median, and themode; measures of group differencessuch as the t-test, ANOVA, and MANOVA;and measures of covariation, such as cor-relation, factor analyses, and regressionanalyses. Measures of covariation assessthe degree to which two or more vari-ables change in relation to each other.For example, height and weight covary(or are correlated) while age and ethnici-ty do not. In general tall people weighmore than shorter people while ethnicitydoes not change with age.
What are measures of central tendency?
These are ways to characterize a population or a sample. The mean is the average
score. It is calculated by dividing the sum of scores by the number of scores. Forexample, the average of the series {4, 7, 8, 9, 9} equals 7.4, (4 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 9 divided by5). The median refers to the number that falls in the middle of the sample; half of the
scores lie above it and half lie below. In this case the median is 8. The mode refers to
the most common score. In this case the mode is 9. Each measure of central tendencyhas different advantages and disadvantages.
What is the difference between the median and the mean and why does
it matter?
The mean is very sensitive to extreme values, also known as outliers, and so can give adistorted view of a population when some values are much higher than the rest. Themedian is not affected by outliers and thus can be a more stable measure of centraltendencies. For example, the mean of 8, 8, 9, 12, 13, and 102 is equal to 26.4 but themedian is equal to 10.5. This distinction is very important when describing character-

measuring traits of a personality disorder. The vertical axisrepresents the count, or the number of people who attained eachscore. The horizontal axis represents the scale score. In this graph,the vast majority of the subjects scored on the low end of thescale while a few people had much higher scores. When thedistribution of scores is concentrated toward one end of the scale,we say there is a skewed distribution. In a normal distribution the
majority of scores are in the middle with a few scores moving outtoward the far ends of either side. When the distribution is skewedlike this, the mean, median, and mode separate from each other.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 82istics such as national income. Due to a small percentage of people with very large
incomes, the average or mean income in the United States is higher than the medianincome. Because of this the U.S. Census only reports median income. The mean, onthe other hand, is more useful in statistical analyses.
What does correlation mean?
Correlation is one of the most common ways of evaluating the relationship betweentwo variables. If one variable increases at the same time another one increases, the twovariables are positively correlated . For example, gregariousness and number of friends
are well correlated. The more gregarious a person is the more friends they are likely tohave. Less gregarious people are likely to have fewer friends. If one variable increaseswhile another decreases, the two variables are negatively correlated. Age and impulsivi-
ty are negatively correlated. The older someone gets, the less likely they are to engagein impulsive behavior. Likewise younger people are more likely to engage in impulsivebehavior. If there is no relationship between variables, they have no correlation. Monthof birth and mathematical skills have no relationship. We do not anticipate that themonth of birth would have any impact on a person’s mathematical ability.
What are the critical concepts one needs to know when interpreting the
results of a study?
We trust the scientific method to give us reliable knowledge. Nevertheless, researchshould never be taken at face value. There are many ways a study can be biased and it isextremely important to be able to interpret the results of a study critically. The issue ofvalidity is of particular importance. Are the results valid or is the study flawed to the
extent that the conclusions are not supported by the data? Internal validity refers to the
integrity of the study methods. Is there a fatal flaw that is intrinsic to the design of thedesign? For example, a study comparing the effectiveness of two drugs used one drugthat had passed its expiration date. In this case, drug B may be less effective than drug Asimply because it passed its expiration date. External validity refers to the extent to
which the results can be applied to a larger population. A study of attitudes toward reli-gion that only includes atheists will have limited external validity. It may be an accuratemeasure of the subjects’ religious beliefs but the study would not tell us much aboutnon-atheists. In general, internal validity is more important than external validity.
What does a study confound mean?
A confound is something that biases the results of a study. It is a third, extraneousvariable that accounts for the relationship between the two variables of interest. Forexample, much of the early literature on intelligence tests found that Americans ofnorthern European descent had greater intelligence than immigrants from southern
83MAJOR MOVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGYHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 83or eastern Europe. These results were confounded by language fluency as the immi-
grants were not fluent in English. We cannot conclude that the difference in test
scores across ethnic groups is due to intelligence if it is confounded by language abili-ty. There are statistical techniques to control for confounds, but they are not appropri-ate in all cases and it is always better, if possible, to avoid confounds in the first place.
What does it mean when a study is generalizeable?
If the results of a study can be applied to a larger population, we say the study is gen-
eralizeable. Another term for generalizeability is external validity.
PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS
What role do psychological tests play in the science of psychology?
Psychological tests are the bread and butter—the currency—of psychological science.Research in psychology depends upon the measurement of psychological traits, whichcan only be accomplished with psychological tests. Nonetheless, psychological traitsare inherently difficult to assess. They are not concrete objects that are obviously mea-sured, like the number of green peas or the height of a giraffe. They are abstract andintangible traits like love or happiness or self-esteem that can neither be seen,touched, nor counted and may be interpreted differently by different people. Thereforea critical part of psychological research involves the construction of tests that canmeasure psychological traits in a systematic and reliable way.
What are the different kinds of tests?
There are many forms of psychological tests, all of which offer both advantages and dis-advantages. Perhaps the most common form of test is a self-report questionnaire , in
which a subject answers a series of questions that gives information about one or morepsychological traits. These tests are quick and easy to develop, to administer, and toscore, but they are limited by the likelihood of inaccuracies in the subject’s self report.
Clinician-administered questionnaires allow the clinician to make the final scor-
ing decision based on the subject’s responses to each question.
Interviews , like questionnaires, involve a series of questions administered to the
subject, but the interviewer has room to follow up each question with probes to obtainmore information or clarify responses.
Projective tests, like the TAT or the Rorschach, ask the subject to complete a task
(e.g., to tell a story based on a picture), which is intended to reveal characteristic waysof thinking, feeling, and behaving. The subject, however, is unaware of the informa-tion being revealed.
84Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 84In cognitive tests, the subject completes various tasks that involve intellectual
skills, like memorizing a list of words or arranging blocks to match a pattern.
Sensory or motor tasks likewise measure sensory skills, such as sensitivity to
touch, or motor skills such as visual-motor coordination.
Tests in these last three categories are often called objective tests because they
involve the assessment of objective behavior.
What are some examples of test questions that measure emotional or
behavioral traits?
The two excerpts listed below give sample items from a psychological test measuring
various emotional and behavioral traits. The first group of questions measures angerregulation and the second group of questions measures sustained initiative. The ques-tions can either be read aloud by the examiner in an interview format or given to thesubject to fill out as a self-report questionnaire. Note how the answers are translatedinto numbers, which can then be added together to form a total score.

How are tests and measurements developed?
A good deal of work goes into test construction. First, the construct must be defined. What
exactly are you trying to measure? Then, taking the most typical case of a self-report ques-tionnaire, the items must be selected. Next, the test must be administered to several sam-ples of people to prove that it is a consistent and reliable measure of the construct it isintended to measure. Two critical concepts in test construction are reliability and validity.
What does it mean to say a test is reliable?
The reliability of a test refers to its ability to measure a given trait consistently. If theoutcome of a measure varies each time it is applied, the measure is not reliable. There
are several forms of reliability, depending on the format and purpose of the test. Inter-
item consistency means that the individual items of a test are inter-correlated, or they
are well related to each other. This form of reliability is used with questionnaires inwhich multiple items are used to rate one trait. Test-retest reliability measures how
well an initial administration of a test correlates with a repeated administration. This isonly useful if the trait measured is unlikely to change much over time. Inter-rater reli-
ability is used with semi-structured questionnaires and other instruments in which the
rater must use complex subjective judgments in the scoring. An instrument has inter-rater reliability when two or more raters rate the same material the same way.
What does it mean to say a test is valid?
The validity of a test reflects the degree to which it is measuring what it says it is mea-
suring. Validity is often measured by correlation with a similar measure of the same con-struct. For example, a depression rating scale could be correlated with another question-naire that measures depression. Differences across groups can also be used to establishvalidity. Does a group of depressed psychiatric inpatients score higher on the depressionscale than a group of healthy subjects? For that matter, do the depressed patients scorehigher on the depression scale than a group of inpatients with schizophrenia? With con-
vergent validity , measures of similar constructs will rate the same material similarly.
Two measures of depression should be positively correlated. With divergent validity,measures of different constructs will rate the same material differently. A measure ofdepression should not be well correlated with a measure of happiness.
Can you have reliability without validity?
A test can be reliable without being valid. For example a ruler is a reliable measure. Itwill always measure a given distance the same way. However, it is not a valid measure of
86Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 86depression, as the outcome of its measurements, no matter how consistent, have no
relationship to depression. Although a test can be reliable without being valid, it cannotbe valid without being reliable. If a test is inconsistent in its measurements, we cannotsay it is measuring what it is intended to measure and, therefore, it is considered invalid.
What is the Rorschach inkblot test ?
The Rorschach inkblot test is a well-known projective test. In fact, it was once so wide-ly used that it was frequently portrayed in the popular media, often as a mysteriousand somewhat menacing test that could magically see into people’s souls. TheRorschach consists of ten cards with images of inkblots, some in black-and-white andsome with color. These blots were created by Herman Rorschach (1884–1922), whofirst published the test in 1922. Just as people see images in clouds, subjects seeimages in the inkblots and they are asked to identify and describe these images. Theresponses are then coded for their content and form, which are seen as reflective ofthe subject’s own mental processes. There are no set answers to this test; the subjectmust project his or her own thought processes onto the blot in order to make sense ofit. The Rorschach is therefore called a projective test. Perhaps because HermanRorschach originally developed his test with inpatient schizophrenics, this test is par-ticularly sensitive to psychotic thought process.
What criticisms have been leveled at the Rorschach ?
Although numerous scoring systems for the Rorschach have been developed since itsoriginal publication in 1922, in its heyday in the mid-twentieth century, theRorschach was interpreted arbitrarily, according to the whim of the clinician who wasadministering the test. Claims for thepower of the Rorschach were alsooverblown and poorly supported byempirical research. Because of that, theRorschach has been harshly criticized asunscientific. It was further disparagedbecause of its strong ties to psychoanaly-sis, a discipline also criticized as unscien-tific. Like the Rorschach, psychoanalysisinvolves the identification of emotionalmeaning in ostensibly neutral material.
How did Exner’s system give the
Rorschach scientific legitimacy?
In 1974, John Exner published the Com-prehensive Scoring System for the Ror -

This ink blot design is very similar to those used in Rorschach
tests. As an experiment, try to see what images you can findin the ink blot. What part of the blot do you use? Are yourimages based on the form of the blot, or the white space?(iStock)Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 87schach, in which he reworked earlier scoring systems into a comprehensive and sys-
tematic approach. He also provided considerable empirical research for his results,showing perfectly respectable reliability and validity. His system has been revised andupdated multiple times. While there are still criticisms leveled at Exner’s approach,many of them legitimate, he has undeniably provided a scientifically supported systemwith which to score the Rorschach.
What is the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT)?
The TAT is another projective test, almost as well known as the Rorschach. The TAT wasdeveloped by Henry Murray in 1938. It consists of 20 cards with evocative and ambigu-ous drawings involving one or more people. Usually, only ten cards are administered at atime. Subjects are asked to tell a story about what is happening in the picture, what ledup to it, and what will happen afterward. Subjects are also asked to say what the charac-ters are thinking and feeling. Because the images are ambiguous, the subjects’ storieswill reveal their personal ways of processing interpersonal relationships. Unfortunately,the TAT has not had the benefit of a John Exner to develop a modern scoring system.Therefore, without a reliable and valid scoring system, the TAT can only be used qualita-tively and only in conjunction with other scientifically supported tests.
What is the Minnesota Multiphasic Inventory (MMPI)?
The MMPI is one of the oldest and best known self-report questionnaires. It measuresvarious aspects of personality and psychopathology. The original version of the MMPIwas developed in the 1940s. The second edition of the MMPI, known as the MMPI-2, iscurrently in use and was last revised in 1989. Eight basic syndrome scales are derivedfrom 567 self-report items in a true/false format. These are Hypochondriasis, Hysteria,Psychopathic Deviancy, Paranoia, Psychasthenia, Schizophrenia, and Mania. Addition-al scales include Masculinity-Femininity, Social Introversion and three validity scalesto assess response biases, such as under-reporting or over-reporting. There is also ashorter MMPI-A for adolescents.
INTELLIGENCE TESTING
What is an IQ test?
An IQ test is a test of cognitive skills that produces an IQ score. This refers to an intel-
ligence quotient, which is an estimate of general intelligence. IQ tests have multiplesubtests to tap different kinds of intellectual skills, such as memory, vocabulary, rea-soning, attention, and copying skills. Tests therefore can include lists of vocabularywords to define, arithmetic problems, or drawings to be copied. All subtests have both
88Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 88easy and hard items, and the items become more difficult as the test goes on. The
score is based on the number of items answered correctly.
What does it mean to say that an IQ test is normed?
Test norms allow comparison of any individual’s score with those of the general popula-
tion. In other words, when a test is normed, it is possible to know the percentile rank of
any given score, which means the percentage of people who scored below it. In order toestablish test norms, the test is administered to a large sample of people. The average (ormean) score and the standard deviation are then calculated. The standard deviation mea-sures how much the individual scores vary from the average score. Are all the scoresclustered tightly around the mean or are they all spread out? If you know both the meanand the standard deviation of a test, you can determine the percentile rank of any score.Thus IQ scores reflect a person’s percentile rank according to the tests’ norms.
What is the Wechsler Adult Intelligence (WAIS) IQ test?
The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Test is the most widely-used intelligence test. The firstWAIS was published in 1958. The WAIS-IV, published in 2008, produces a Full Scale IQbased on scores from ten core subtests. These core subtests include Vocabulary, Similari-ties, Information, Arithmetic, Digit Span, Block Design, Matrix Reasoning, Visual Puz-zles, Digit Symbol, and Symbol Search. Five supplemental tests include Comprehension,Letter-Number Sequencing, Picture Completion, Figure Weights, and Cancellation.
What are the four index scores of the WAIS-IV?
The WAIS subtests are grouped into four index scores, each measuring a specific cog-nitive skill. The Verbal Comprehension Index reflects the ability to express abstractideas in words. The Perceptual Reasoning Index reflects the ability to process visualand spatial information; the Working Memory Index suggests the ability to hold andmanipulate information in memory; and the Processing Speed Index indicates theability to process information rapidly. These indices show that intelligence, as mea-sured by the WAIS, has several very different components.
Does the WAIS measure intelligence?
Whether any one test can measure a concept as complex as intelligence has been atopic of considerable controversy. What we do know is that the WAIS does a good jobof measuring a range of cognitive skills that are indicators of other measures of intelli-gence, such as academic and occupational success. WAIS subtests are also well corre-lated with many other cognitive tests and with studies on brain activity. In otherwords, compared with those who have lower scores, people with high scores on theWAIS are more likely to perform well in school and in their work life and to score well
89MAJOR MOVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGYHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 89on other tests of thinking ability. They are also more likely to show greater activity in
the areas of the brain associated with complex thought.
Is there agreement on what intelligence means?
There is some agreement that general intelligence does exist and that people vary in howmuch of it they have. Nonetheless, there is considerable disagreement as to the exact wayto define intelligence. Loosely, we can define intelligence to refer to the ability to processinformation in a way that allows individuals to adapt to their environment. This defini-tion suggests, however, that intelligence may vary according to the environment. If youlive in a hunting and gathering society, your intelligence will have nothing to do withyour ability to read abstract philosophy texts and much more to do with your ability tointerpret your natural surroundings. In fact, someone who scores very highly on theWAIS would probably perform very poorly if he or she had been dropped into the Aus-tralian bush in the middle of the nineteenth century. Likewise, an aboriginal Australianfrom the nineteenth century with no formal education would perform extremely poorlyon the WAIS, but would have an enormous store of knowledge and skills about survivingin the bush. Because the nature of intelligence is inherently dependent on an individual’senvironment, there are chronic problems with cultural bias in intelligence tests. It isarguably impossible to design an intelligence test completely free from cultural bias.
What are the best ways to reduce cultural bias in IQ tests?
While it is probably impossible to remove all cultural bias from IQ tests, there are ways toensure that the test is relevant to as broad a sample of people as possible. This is especially
90Are IQ tests useful?
The IQ, as measured by the WAIS, does a good job of measuring the kinds ofcognitive skills that are useful for functioning in a complex, industrialized,
modern society. These include abstract and verbal problem-solving skills andcomplex attention. The IQ gives a good general sense of the person’s overallintellectual performance. But when the data is interpreted, close attention mustbe paid to the subtests because an individual’s performance may vary widely,with very high scores on some tests and low scores on others. The IQ is also vul-nerable to many cultural biases. The subtests and the functional indices are veryuseful, however, for providing a profile of an individual’s thought processes. Thisprofile can be helpful in diagnosing various neurological or psychiatric condi-tions, such as dementia, depression, attention deficit disorder, or mental retar-dation. Thus, regardless of the person’s IQ score, the profile of subtests can beenormously helpful for clinical purposes.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 90important in highly diverse societies such
as the United States. The WAIS-IV includesnon-verbal tests such as Block Design andMatrix Reasoning that are not dependent onlanguage and not too dependent on educa-tion. Further, the use of abstract, geometricshapes avoids culturally meaningful images.It is also important to exclude items thatdepend on knowledge that is relevant toonly a small percentage of the population.For example, early intelligence tests includ-ed items on the make and model of specificcars, which would only be relevant to peoplewho drive and who care about cars. Anotherimportant way to reduce cultural bias is toprovide norms for different segments of thepopulation. The WAIS-IV includes normsfor different age groups and many othercognitive tests provide separate norms for people with different levels of education. Finally,translation of tests into several languages is also very important.
Are there other kinds of intelligence that the WAIS doesn’t measure?
If we define intelligence as information processing that allows us to adapt to our envi-ronment, then the WAIS only taps a narrow range of such skills. Howard Gardiner hasargued against the idea of a single, unitary intelligence, proposing instead the exis-tence of multiple intelligences, including forms based in the body, and social and emo-tional forms of intelligence. Similarly, Daniel Goleman has written extensively aboutemotional intelligence , the ability to process emotional and interpersonal information
effectively. Folk psychology speaks about street smarts, political acumen, businesssmarts, mechanical aptitude, and even common sense. None of these are directly mea-sured on the WAIS, although we would assume the visual-spatial tests to have somerelationship to mechanical aptitude. We do know, however, that people with very lowintellectual skills—as measured by tests such as the WAIS—have significantly reducedinterpersonal and self-care skills. On the other hand, we probably all know people withvery high IQs who are sorely lacking in emotional and interpersonal skills and evencommon sense. Therefore we can conclude that the WAIS measures some aspects ofintelligence that are related, but not identical, to other aspects of intelligence.
What were the Alpha and Beta Tests developed by the U.S. Army?
In 1917, immediately after the United States entered World War I, the American Psy-chological Association (APA) convened a committee to consider how best to con-
91MAJOR MOVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGY
Some people question the usefulness of IQ tests because it is
difficult to create a test that is not skewed somewhat bycultural biases ( iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 91tribute to the war effort. The committee concluded that the development of an intelli-
gence test that could be administered to large groups would be most useful. Potentialsoldiers falling below a cut-off point would be excluded from the military, while highscorers could be selected for elite positions.
Under the guidance of Robert Yerkes, a Harvard psychologist and army major, the
Army Alpha, a written test, and the Army Beta, a pictorial version for the 40 percent ofsoldiers unable to read the written test, were developed. These tests had broad impacton the discharge and promotion of soldiers. The use of such tests in WWI spawned anexplosion of intelligence and aptitude tests after the war to be used in schools, the mil-itary, and other institutions.
Criticism of cultural bias soon followed, with complaints that the content of the
Army tests favored affluent native-born Americans over less privileged immigrants,who could not be expected to know, for example, the engines of different luxury carsor the layout of a tennis court. Further, many questions were moralistic, as if dis-agreement with Anglo-American values reflected lower intelligence. Despite these verylegitimate complaints, it must be kept in mind that intelligence tests aimed for amerit-based approach to job placement. In this way, the army at least tried to be moredemocratic than the explicitly prejudiced, family- and class-based approaches toemployment that were typically used before. Today’s intelligence and aptitude testsaim for much greater cultural sensitivity. Nonetheless, it is arguably impossible todevelop a test that is completely culture-neutral.
Who devised the first intelligence test?
John Galton (1822–1911), the father of Eugenics, was one of the first scientists to studyindividual differences in intelligence. He presumed such differences were inherited, whatwe would now call genetic, and he aimed to separate the most intelligent individuals fromthe least in the interest of selective breeding. In keeping with Wilhelm Wundt’s studies ofsensation and perception, his initial intelligence tests comprised various measures ofhand grip, reaction time to sensory stimuli, and other sensory-motor skills. James Cattell(1860–1944) carried this work forward and developed an intelligence test based on Gal-ton’s work. In his position as professor of psychology at Columbia University, he adminis-tered his test to hundreds of college freshmen. (Perhaps this was the beginning of a longtradition of using college freshmen in psychological research.)
By 1901, he had sufficient data to correlate students’ grades with their intelli-
gence test results. To his great disappointment, there was no relationship at allbetween the two variables. We might attribute these negative findings to two factors: alack of construct validity, such that psychophysical measures have no relationship atall to academic performance, and restriction of range. College freshmen at an eliteuniversity will not vary that much in intelligence, so some correlations with intelli-gence may be masked by this fact.
92Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 92What does mental age mean?
Alfred Binet (1857–1911), a French psychologist, furthered the work of Galton and
Cattell with his concept of mental age. While observing his own children develop newcognitive skills as they grew, Binet recognized that intelligence could be measureddevelopmentally. By comparing the test performance of a child with the age at whichsuch performance was expected, he could calculate a mental age for each child.
What was the Binet-Simon test?
Influenced by a mandate from the French government addressing the needs of mental-ly retarded children, Binet and his colleague Théodore Simon decided to develop a testcapable of distinguishing mentally retarded children from those of normal intelligence.They did this through multiple administrations and refinements of their measure, giv-ing the test both to children of normal intelligence and those identified as mentallyretarded. The first version of their test was published in 1905, with several revisions fol-lowing in quick succession. By providing the expected scores for each age in the 1908edition, Binet and Simon created the first empirically validated, standardized test.Within a few years, the Binet-Simon test had spread to countries on five continents.
What is the Stanford-Binet intelligence test?
Lewis M. Terman (1877–1956) at Stanford University revised and refined the Binet-Simon test to increase its sensitivity at the higher end of the scale. The Stanford-Binettest, published in 1916, was the first test to use IQ scores. An IQ score (or intelligencequotient) is derived from a large sample of test results. Terman set the mean IQ score at100 and the standard deviation at 10. By translating raw scores into IQ scores, the per-centile rank of each score could be calculated. For example, an IQ score of 100 falls inthe 50th percentile, of 80 in the 2.5th percentile, and one of 130 in the 99th percentile.The Stanford-Binet was the primary IQ test used for many decades and is currently inits fifth edition. In 1958, two years after Terman died, David Wechsler published theWechsler Adult Intelligence Test (WAIS), which is now the more widely used IQ test.
What were the problems with the early IQ tests ?
The problem with Galton’s approach was an utter lack of relationship between outsideindications of intelligence, such as school performance, and the measures used. Histests had more to do with physical coordination and strength than intelligence and assuch had no construct validity. Later tests also had problems with validity but thesewere more subtle. For the most part, they were extremely culturally biased, servingthe anti-immigrant bias of the first several decades of the twentieth century. Here thebiggest problem was generalizeability, meaning the applicability of the test to a largerpopulation. There was no consideration of English-speaking ability or of culturally rel-
93MAJOR MOVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGYHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 93evant knowledge. Some items only measured knowledge available to wealthy, English-
speaking, and native-born Americans. Other items measured moral values more thanstrict intellectual skills. Later IQ tests addressed these problems by including non-ver-bal tests, considering cultural relevance when including items, and basing test normson samples carefully constructed to match the demographics of the United States.
94Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 94BASIC CONCEPTS IN NEUROSCIENCE
Why do we study the brain?
As early as 500 B.C.E., Alcmaeon of Croton identified the brain as the physical seat of
the mind. Twenty-five hundred years later, modern science has proven this ancient
Greek to be absolutely correct. There is no aspect of psychology that is independent ofthe brain. The very essence of our humanity—our thoughts, our feelings, our beliefs,and our values—all emerge from this three-pound lump of gray tissue. Psychology hasno choice but to take the brain into consideration. Moreover, with the remarkableadvances of neuroscience in the last few decades, we now know more about the brainand its relationship to the mind than at any other time in human history.
What do neuroscientists assume about brain evolution and how does that
influence our understanding of the brain?
In order to understand brain research, it is important to consider three basic assump-tions that neuroscientists make about brain evolution. For one, the brain is believedto carry traces of its evolutionary origins deep within its tissues. Just as we carrytraces of our earliest childhood within our adult personalities, the brain carries thehistory of our whole species within its very anatomy. Secondly, the brain has evolvedup and out, so that the lowest and deepest parts of the brain are the oldest. The outer-most, uppermost, and the furthest forward brain regions are the youngest on the evo-lutionary scale. Thirdly, our brains have increased in complexity across evolution. Theolder structures tend to be simpler and more primitive, both in their anatomy and inthe behavioral functions they control. Likewise, the evolutionarily newer structurestend to be more complex.
95
BRAIN AND
BEHAVIORHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 95What are the costs and benefits of complexity?
As brain structures have evolved toward greater complexity, we can ask what benefits
complexity may offer. Are there any costs? In general, complexity allows for more flex-ibility. Complex systems have a broader repertoire of responses with which to adapt tocomplicated or changing circumstances. However, complexity is expensive. Complexsystems take more energy and are more fragile than simpler systems. With more partsinvolved, it is easier for something to go wrong.
How costly is our brain?
Although our brain only weighs about three pounds (two to three percent of the averageperson’s body weight), it uses up about 15 percent of the blood that our heart pumps outand about 20 percent of our body’s oxygen and glucose. In other words it uses up to tentimes as much of the body’s resources as would be expected for its weight.
What terminology is important in brain anatomy ?
Although we will try to stick to plain English in this book, it is useful to know thebasic terminology used in the discussion of brain anatomy. As the brain is a three-dimensional structure, specific terms are used to distinguish up from down, backfrom front, and inside from outside. The terms anterior andposterior are used to refer
to front and back, respectively, as are the Latin words rostral and caudal. Superior and
inferior refer to top and bottom, respectively, as do the Latin words dorsal and ventral.
Lateral refers to outside, while medial
refers to the inside.
How do the Latin terms differ from
the English ones?
The English terms are purely directionalwhile the Latin ones are defined in refer-ence to the body. Rostral and caudal are the
Latin words for head and tail. Likewise, dor-saland ventral refer to the back and belly of
a body (as in the dorsal fin of a shark).Medial means close to the body’s midline
while lateral means away from it. Nonethe-
less, when we speak about the brain, rostraland caudal are generally understood tomean front and back, dorsal and ventral tomean top and bottom, and medial and lat-eral to mean inside and outside.

The word phylogeny means evolution. To say something is phylogenetically old means
that is old in evolutionary terms.
What have we learned from animals?
Our understanding of the human brain is heavily indebted to the study of animal
brains. Although the use of animals in biological research raises moral questionsabout animal rights, there is no question that much of our knowledge about thehuman brain derives from research on animal brains. Legally and ethically, we canperform much more invasive procedures on animal brains than we can on livinghuman brains. Additionally, comparison of the brains of many different kinds of ani-mals gives us critical insight into brain evolution.
THE MAJOR STRUCTURES
OF THE BRAIN
What are the major structures of the brain?
The brain is an intricate structure that looks like a boxing glove placed over a spiralof sea creatures. The outer layer of the brain is called the cortex, or the neocortex. Itis a wrinkled surface that covers the top and sides of the brain. This is the part thatlooks like a boxing glove, albeit a wrinkled one. Underneath the cortex are the sub-
cortical regions: the cerebellum and brain stem at the very base of the brain, the
thalamus and related regions toward the middle of the brain, and the limbic system,which wraps around the thalamus. The basal ganglia are also in the middle of thebrain, close to the thalamus.
What is the difference between the cortex and the subcortical regions?
The distinction between the cortical and subcortical regions of the brain is an impor-tant one. The cortex is a relatively recent evolutionary achievement and the corticalstructures are much more developed in humans than they are in more primitive ani-mals. Most of the more complex psychological processes, the ones we think of asuniquely human, such as language, abstract thought, and reading, are controlled bythe cortex. The subcortical regions process more fundamental psychological and evenphysiological functions. The lowest parts of the brain, closest to the spinal cord, arethe oldest parts and regulate physiological processes we share with more primitiveanimals, such as breathing, heartbeat, and digestion.
97BRAIN AND BEHAVIORHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 9798THECORTEX
Why is the cortex so wrinkled?
The surface of the cortex is covered with folds and looks somewhat like a walnut.
These folds are referred to as convolutions. The rounded parts of the convolutions arecalled gyri, gyrus in the singular. The grooves between the gyri are called sulci (sulcus
in the singular). These extra folds allow for much greater surface area, which in turngreatly increases the number of neurons that can fit into the relatively small space ofthe human skull. The more neurons we have, the more powerfully we can processinformation. To illustrate this efficient use of space, imagine an accordion or pleatedpaper fan, first folded up and then stretched out from end to end.
What are the four lobes of the cortex?
The cortex is divided into four lobes, the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital
lobes. The frontal lobe comprises the front half of the cortex. It extends from the cen-tral sulcus forward. The thumb-like segments of the cortex are the temporal lobes.The parietal lobes cover much of the back surface of the cortex, extending from thecentral sulcus back to the border with the occipital lobe (the parietooccipital sulcus).Finally the occipital lobes are at the lower back end of the cortex.
What is the frontal lobe?
The frontal lobe is considered the seat of our intellect. It covers about half the humancortex and is the most recently evolved part of the brain. More specifically it mediatesour executive functions , a group of psychological functions that serve to control our
behavior. These include planning, abstract thought, impulse control, and the controlof behavioral sequences. As might be imagined, impairment in these areas can lead tosignificant problems functioning in the world. The frontal lobe has other functionsbesides executive functions, though. The most posterior region of the frontal lobe iscalled the motor strip and is involved with intentional movements. Additionally,Broca’s area, on the left posterior side of the frontal lobe, mediates speech production,or the translation of thought into spoken words.
What do the other cortical lobes do?
The three remaining cortical lobes are all involved with some aspect of sensation andperception. The occipital lobe is involved with vision. The parietal lobe processes bothtouch and taste (in the somatosensory strip) and the temporal lobes are involved withhearing. Additionally, the parietal lobes are involved with attention and visual-spatialinformation, while the temporal lobes mediate language, memory, and the recognitionof familiar objects.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 98Different areas of the brain control different functions ( LifeArt).BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR
99How do Brodman areas map the cortex?
In 1909, Korbinian Brodman (1868–1918) tried to standardize the discussion of brain
anatomy by creating a map of the cortex. He first divided the cortex into distinctregions based on the way neurons were organized (cytoarchitecture). He then num-bered these regions from one to 52. Only 45 Brodmann areas are found in the humanbrain, however; the other seven are found in the monkey brain. Although brain struc-ture may vary somewhat across individuals, this system has been extremely helpful forneuroscientists, giving them a common language with which to talk about brainanatomy. Nonetheless, there is still variation in the terms used, as many brain struc-tures have several different names.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 99Do both sides of the brain do the same thing?
The two halves of the brain are almost, but not quite, identical. With regard to the cor-
tex, there is considerable difference in the functions they perform. This differencebetween right and left sides of the brain is called lateralization. The left side of the
cortex is involved with language comprehension and speech production. The rightside of the brain is involved with spatial and emotional processing and facial recogni-tion. Because of lateralization, the impact of brain damage (for example due to stroke)will differ depending on the side of the brain affected.
BENEATH THE CORTEX
What is the limbic system?
The limbic system is the seat of our emotions. The term was first introduced by JamesPapez in 1937 and refers to a group of brain structures in the middle of the brain. Theoriginal Papez circuit included the hippocampus, the fornix, the mammilary bodies,the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, and the cingulate gyrus. Over time the bound-aries of the limbic system were expanded, although the exact definition of the limbicsystem is still not universal. For our purposes, however, we can include the amygdala,
hippocampus, hypothalamus, septum, and cingulate gyrus. These regions are all
involved with emotional and motivational processing.
Where does the word amygdala come from?
The amygdala is a small, almond-shaped structure buried deep in the middle of the brain.
Because of its oval shape, the amygdala was named after the Greek word for almond.
What do the amygdala and the hypothalamus do?
The amygdala seems to be an early responder to emotionally significant signals fromthe environment. It is particularly reactive to fearful stimuli. The amygdala activatesthe hypothalamus , which in turn activates the autonomic nervous system, in part
through control of important hormones. The autonomic nervous system regulates thephysiological components of emotion. For example, imagine that a vicious dog hasbroken free of its leash and is now lunging toward you. Immediately, your amygdalaresponds to the perception of danger. It sends signals to the hypothalamus, whichthen activates the autonomic nervous system, resulting in the rapid heartbeat, sweatypalms, and heavy breathing associated with fear.
What does the hippocampus do?
The hippocampus is a caterpillar-like structure on the medial (inner) side of the temporal
lobe and is heavily involved with memory. Early brain anatomists believed it looked more 100Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 100like a seahorse and named it after the Greek word for seahorse (hippo = horse). While the
hippocampus does not process emotion, per se, it is located near the other limbic struc-tures and carries memories of emotionally meaningful events. What we interpret as emo-tionally arousing, therefore, is heavily dependent on our memories of similar experiences.
What do the other limbic structures do?
The septum is a small area that is involved with the experience of pleasure among
other functions. The cingulate gyrus is a long structure that wraps around numerous
other subcortical regions and has attentional, emotional, and cognitive functions.More specifically, it is involved with decision making.

What are the basal ganglia?
The basal ganglia are centrally involved with action and motor behavior. The basal
ganglia are actually a group of brain regions, including the putamen, globus pallidus,and caudate nucleus. This part of the brain is relatively old, phylogenetically, and han-dles the more automatic aspects of behavior. When we learn a new behavioralsequence, like riding a bicycle, we initially depend on the frontal lobes while we areconcentrating on what we are doing. After the behavior is learned and becomes more
101BRAIN AND BEHAVIORHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 101automatic, however, it is handled by the
basal ganglia. Damage to the basal gan-glia can severely disrupt motor behavior,as is found in neurological diseases likeParkinson’s or Huntington’s disease.
What is the brain stem?
The brain stem is the oldest and most
primitive part of the brain. It regulatesbasic physiological processes necessaryfor life, such as breathing, temperatureregulation, sleep-wake cycle, and cardiacfunction. The brain stem has been rela-tively conserved across evolution andtherefore does not dramatically differacross animal species.
What is the triune model?
In 1964, Paul D. MacLean (1913–2007) divided the brain into three general regions,the reptilian, palio-mammalian, and neo-mammalian, which he believed to corre-
spond with different periods of evolution. The neo-mammalian region of the brainrefers to the neocortex, which includes the frontal lobe and most cortical regions.These parts of the brain are most developed in more complex and evolutionarilyyounger mammals, such as primates. The paleo-mammalian region incorporates thelimbic system, which is found in all mammals. The reptilian area of the brain refers tothe brain stem and the cerebellum, phylogenetically ancient regions that are found insome of the most ancient and primitive species (e.g., reptiles). Although MacLean’striune model has been criticized as overly simplistic, it does provide a useful way fornon-specialists to picture the brain.
THENEURON
What is a neuron?
A neuron is a brain cell, the basic building block of the brain. The entire brain is actu-ally a huge network of interlocking, interacting neurons. There are about one hun-dred billion neurons in the human brain and several times that amount of glial andother smaller cells that support neuronal function. A neuron is composed of a cell
body, an axon, and a profusion of branching dendrites.
102
MacLean’s triune system ( iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 102What are the input and output
sections of the cell?
Brain cells have both input and output
sections. Dendrites are the tree-like
extensions that reach out from the cellbody. They are the input section of thecell and carry electrical information intothe cell body from the axons of otherneurons. Axons are the output section of
the cell and carry electrical informationfrom the cell out to other neurons. Axonscan be extremely long, reaching from thebrain all the way down to the base of thespine. While some axons branch into twosections, by and large there is only oneaxon per neuron. At the end of the axon,the cell branches into numerous axonterminals. One axon can have thousandsof axon terminals. The majority of axonterminals connect with the dendrites ofother cells, resulting in trillions of neu-ronal connections in the typical brain.
What is a synapse?
The contact point between the dendrite of one cell and the axon terminal of another iscalled the synapse. Neurons communicate across synapses with chemical messengersknown as neurotransmitters. The neuron sending the message is called the pre-
synaptic neuron while the neuron receiving the message is the post-synaptic neuron.
The gap between the neurons is called the synaptic cleft.
What are neurotransmitters and what do they do?
Neurotransmitters are the chemical messengers that neurons use to communicatewith each other. When an axon meets up with the dendrite of another cell at thesynapse, neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic cleft. Some of these neuro-transmitters are excitatory and others are inhibitory. Both types of neurotransmitters
change the electrical charge of the postsynaptic neuron.
How do neurons fire?
When a neuron fires, it sends an electrical impulse down the length of the axon tothe axon terminals. Excitatory neurotransmitters make it easier for the post-synaptic
103BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR
This computer graphic illustrates the basic structure of a
neuron. The dendrites branch up away from the cell body. Theaxon reaches down from the cell body. Note the segmentedsheath covering the axon. This is the myelin sheath, a fattycovering that increases the speed that an action potentialtravels down the axon. Note also the branching at the end ofthe axon. This is the axon terminal. ( iStock)Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 103neurons to fire; inhibitory neurotrans-
mitters make it more difficult. Each cellreceives excitatory and inhibitory inputsfrom many synapses. When the sum totalof these inputs reaches a certain thresh-old, the neuron fires, sending an electri-cal impulse down the axon. This firing isknown as an action potential. When the
action potential reaches the bottom ofthe axon, the axon terminals releasetheir own neurotransmitters, stimulat-ing (or inhibiting) action potentials inthe next group of neurons. In this way,wide networks of neurons communicatewith each other in very little time. Actionpotentials commonly travel at speeds of50 meters per second and can occurevery five-hundredth of a millisecond.
What is the difference between white matter and gray matter?
Axons are coated by a fatty sheath known as myelin that speeds up the rate that the
action potential travels down the axon. Because myelinated axons are white in appear-ance, brain tissue made up of these fibers is called white matter . In contrast, grey
matter refers to brain tissue made up of dendrites and cell bodies (as well as glial cells
and capillaries). The surface of the cortex is composed of grey matter.
BRAIN DEVELOPMENT
THEHUMAN BRAIN ACROSS EVOLUTION
How has the human brain changed across evolution?
Because we see the brain through the lens of evolutionary theory, it is important toconsider how the human brain has changed across evolution. We make inferencesabout how our brain has evolved based on comparisons between human and animalbrains. For one, our brain has become much larger relative to our body size. Evolu-tionarily older and more primitive animals have much smaller brains relative to theirbody size. Think of the dinosaurs with their tiny brains and huge bodies. In fact, our
104
This graphic illustrates both the pre- and post-synaptic
neurons and the synaptic cleft between them. The bright dotsare neurotransmitters that have been released into thesynaptic cleft ( iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 104brains are about three times the size of the brains of our closest relative, the chim-
panzee, although our bodies are not much bigger than theirs. Secondly, the brainhas become much more complex. It is less the size of an animal’s brain that deter-mines its intelligence than the complexity of its neuronal networks. Billions of neu-rons create trillions of connections. Brain size and brain complexity, however, dotend to go together.
How has the cortex grown compared to other animals?
Another way that the human brain has changed across evolution is the growth of thecortex. The neocortex, the six-layer tissue that forms the outer layer of the humanbrain, is found only in mammals. Primitive cortices are evident in smaller mammals,such as hares, opossums, and armadillos, and more developed cortices are evident inhigher-order mammals, such as elephants, dogs, and dolphins. In humans, the cortexwraps around the entire brain. The cortex allows for much more sophisticated pro-cessing of sensory information (e.g. sight, sound, touch). It also allows for more variedand flexible behavioral responses to internal and external stimulation.
Do the different brain regions ever perform redundant functions ?
In some cases, the cortex and subcortical areas provide redundant or overlappingfunctions. For example, both the frontal lobe and the basal ganglia regulate motorbehavior. But the behavior regulated by the basal ganglia is relatively crude and inflex-ible. Although fast and efficient, it is not easily adapted to changing conditions. Behav-ior regulated by the frontal lobe, on the other hand, is much more nuanced, flexible,and responsive to changing conditions. The frontal lobe is often slower, however, andconsumes more energy than the basal ganglia. Thus we are happy to rely on our basalganglia when walking down the sidewalk, but would prefer to employ our frontal lobewhen performing surgery or defusing a bomb.
Has the frontal lobe grown across human evolution?
The greatest change in brain structure across human evolution relates to thefrontal lobe. Frontal lobes are tiny in many smaller mammals, such as tree shrewsand hedgehogs. In higher-order mammals, like cats and dogs, they are still smallerthan in humans and also considerably less convoluted. As mentioned above, theconvolutions on the cortex provide more surface area for dendrites to expand.Relatedly, our species has the most complex and sophisticated cognitive capacitieson earth. That is not to say that other animals do not use some form of thought—chimpanzees use tools to solve problems and gorillas can be taught the rudimentsof language. Nonetheless, as far as we know, no other species really comes close tous with regard to intelligence.
105BRAIN AND BEHAVIORHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 105How has the olfactory bulb changed across human evolution?
One of the most striking differences between the brains of humans and other
mammals involves the size of the olfactory bulb, which is the part of the brain
involved with smell. In many mammals, the olfactory bulb is a major portion ofthe entire brain. In fact it is present in even the most primitive vertebrates, suchas fish. In humans it is a tiny little orb sandwiched between our limbic system andthe bottom of our frontal lobe. This contrast illustrates our reduced reliance onthe sense of smell in favor of vision, hearing, and analytic thinking, all functionssupported by the cortex.
THEBRAIN SINCE EARLY HOMINIDS
When did human beings evolve from early hominids?
About four to five million years ago, our ancestors and chimpanzees diverged from acommon ancestor. The Australopithecus genus was one of the earliest forms ofhominids. The homo genus followed, with several species, such as Homo habilis, Homo
erectus, and Homo sapien neanderthalensis (neanderthals) preceding or even overlap-
ping with modern humans. Modernhumans (Homo sapien sapiens) evolvedbetween 100,000 to 300,000 years ago.
How do we compare our brains with
those of extinct species?
Because soft tissue decomposes quicklywe cannot expect hominid brains to sur-vive over the hundreds of thousands andeven millions of years of evolution.Therefore, paleontologists must workwith skeletal remains, using skulls andother bone fragments to draw inferencesabout the biology and behavior of earlyhominids. However, tools, animal bones,fossilized seeds, and even cave paintings(in the case of early modern humans)have been found alongside hominidskeletal remains, providing intriguingclues about the mental capacity of ourpredecessors.
106
A comparison of chimpanzee and human brains and skulls.
Chimpanzees are the closest genetic relative to humans ( iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 106How has brain size changed from early hominids?
Hominid skulls show a steady increase in cubic centimeters across evolution. Estimat-
ing from skull size and shape, Homo habilis had a brain size of 600 to 700 cubic cen-
timeters (cc) and Homo erectus about 900 to 1,000 cubic centimeters. Homo sapien
sapiens (modern humans) have a brain size of about 1,400 cubic centimeters. Concur-
rent with the increase in brain size, paleontologists find an increase in the complexityof tools found with hominid remains. Larger brains apparently translated into moresophisticated tool use. Additionally, larger brained hominids were adapted to morevaried and/or harsher climates.
Has the frontal lobe increased?
Along with the increase in skull size, the shape of the skull also suggests enlargementof the brain and of the frontal lobe in particular. Australopithecine skulls do not lookmuch different from ape skulls. There is a prominent jaw, a small sloping forehead anda relatively small brain casing. Modern humans, in contrast, have flatter faces, verysteep foreheads, and small jaws. Our foreheads, which lie just in front of the frontallobe, cover about 50 percent of our faces. Likewise our brain casing is greatly enlargedrelative to the rest of our skull.
Is there evidence of language in hominid skulls ?
Indentations on the inside of Homo habilis skulls ( Homo habilis lived about two million
years ago) suggest an enlarged area around the location of Broca’s area, a central regionfor speech production in modern humans. While we cannot know if this area was con-nected to speech in Homo habilis brains, we can suggest that at least a precursor to
modern language regions of the brain was present at a very early point in hominid evo-lution.
What does pedopmorphy mean?
Pedopmorphy refers to an evolutionary process in which adult animals maintain the traits
of juveniles. One fairly easy way for genetic mutations to produce physical changes in theanimal is to adjust the timing of maturation. No new physical structures or behaviorsneed to be introduced; the animal simply maintains its youthful traits instead of sheddingthem when it reaches maturity. There is evidence that many advances in human evolutioninvolve pedomorphy. For example, we are one of the few mammals that retain a high levelof playfulness throughout adulthood. Secondly, the shape of our skull mirrors that ofjuvenile apes. The skulls of juvenile chimpanzees look more like the skulls of adulthumans than the skulls of adult chimpanzees. Adult chimpanzees have small sloping fore-heads, prominent jaws, and more horizontally-aligned faces. Adult humans, on the otherhand, have high foreheads, small jaws, and flat, vertically-aligned faces, similar to juve-
107BRAIN AND BEHAVIORHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 107niles of both species. Of note, juvenile chimpanzees have a larger brain to skull ratio than
do adult chimpanzees. In humans, this favorable ratio is retained into adulthood.
What does “phylogeny recapitulates ontogeny” mean?
This is a nineteenth century idea put forward by a German zoologist named Ernst Haeckel(1834–1919) that development in childhood exactly parallels evolution. Phylogeny refers
to evolution and ontogeny to development across the lifespan. Haeckel believed that every
stage in the development of a human embryo exactly parallels the stages of human evolu-tion. Besides having a faulty view of human evolution (e.g., there was no cow stage inhuman evolution), this theory oversimplified the processes of embryonic development.While Haeckel’s specific theory has been discredited, he was correct in pointing outimportant parallels between evolution and maturation. Careful understanding of ourdevelopment across the lifespan does offer some clues as to our evolutionary history.
THEBRAIN IN UTERO
How does the brain develop in utero?
All vertebrates start life the same way. In their earliest stages of embryonic develop-ment, a flat plate is formed composed of three layers, the ectoderm, mesoderm, and
endoderm. Cells in certain sections divide more quickly than cells in adjacent areas,causing the layers of cells to buckle and fold. In this way, curves and bends are formedand the different parts of the body begin to take shape. The outer layer of the flat plateis called the ectoderm and it is this layer of cells that will curl into the neural tube,
out of which the brain and spinal cord will develop.
After an initial period of furious cell division, some cells are created that are post-
mitotic, that is, they stop dividing. These cells begin the fascinating process of migratingto their final destination. They do so by means of molecular and cellular signposts thatguide their progress. After the cells arrive at their proper place, neuronal connectionsmust be established. Axons are then sent out to travel across broad swaths of territory tocreate synaptic connections with other cells. Their journey throughout the brain is alsodirected by chemical signals that point them toward their destination. The establishmentof specific synaptic connections between neurons is partially controlled by genetic factorsduring pregnancy. The refinement of these synaptic connections, however, takes placelargely after birth and is highly dependent on experience.
What is the neural tube?
The neural tube is a long tubular structure that develops from the outer layer of theinitial plate of embryonic cells. At the head of the neural plate, three bulges form dis-
108Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 108tinct sections. These are called the forebrain, the midbrain and the hindbrain, also
known as the prosencephalon, the mesencephalon, and the rhombencephalon. The
table below lists the parts of the neural tube.

What does the hindbrain become?
The hindbrain divides into the metencephalon and the myelencephalon. These two
sections subsequently develop into the cerebellum and pons on one hand and the
medulla oblongata on the other. The pons and medulla oblongata are both part of the
brain stem. Together with the cerebellum, they form the reptilian brain of PaulMacLean’s triune model.
What does the midbrain become?
The midbrain divides into the tectum and the cerebral peduncle. These deep brain
structures lie just above the brain stem. In primitive vertebrates such as amphibians,fish, and reptiles, the tectum serves as the main visual processing center in the brain.In primates, its function is more restricted as the majority of visual processing is donein the neocortex. The primate tectum helps to control eye movement. In other words,it helps control eye movements. The cerebral peduncle includes several brain areasthat contain the neurons that produce important neurotransmitters. For example, thesubstantia nigra is the origin of a major tract of dopamine neurons.
109BRAIN AND BEHAVIORHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 109What does the forebrain become?
The forebrain develops into the evolutionarily newest parts of the brain and those
most closely involved with mental life per se. The forebrain divides into the dien-
cephalon and the telencephalon. In MacLean’s model, the forebrain includes both the
paleo-mammalian and the neo-mammalian brains.
What does the diencephalon turn into?
The diencephalon divides into the thalamus, the hypothalamus, and several related
regions. The thalamus is involved with sensation. It is the relay station between thesense organs and their corresponding cortical regions. Olfaction (smell) is the onlysense modality that does not run through the thalamus as it is processed directly bythe olfactory bulb. The hypothalamus links the brain to the autonomic nervous sys-tem and serves a critical role in emotion, connecting the mental aspects of emotionwith the body’s physical response.
What develops from the telencephalon?
The telencephalon contains the most advanced parts of the brain. Although present inall vertebrates, it is most developed in birds and mammals. In humans the telen-cephalon develops into the cerebral cortex, the limbic system, the basal ganglia, and
important white matter regions. The cerebral cortex includes the four lobes of the
neocortex as well as those areas on the inside surface of the cortex that directly con-tact the subcortical regions. These include the cingulate gyrus, hippocampal andparahippocampal regions, as well as the insula, which is sandwiched between the tem-poral, frontal, and parietal cortices. The basal ganglia, amygdala, and septum also
develop out of the telencephalon. Finally,cerebral white matter is made up of bun-dles of axons that travel across large sec-tions of the brain. Important cerebralwhite matter structures that develop outof the telencephalon include the anteriorcommissure, the internal capsule, andthe corpus callosum.
What impact does brain injury have
during fetal development?
Because such extraordinarily complexstructures develop out of very simple cellgroupings, early problems in neuro-devel-opment can lead to severe birth defects. For

Given the extraordinary journey that brain cells must travel
during fetal development it is amazing that so many babiesare born without brain damage ( iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 110example, spina bifida is linked to defects in the neural tube. In fact, serious problems in the
first trimester of pregnancy often lead to miscarriage, such that 80 percent of miscarriagesoccur in the first trimester. When we consider the enormous lengths the brain must travelin its journey to maturity, it is indeed remarkable that so many human beings are bornwithout brain damage.
THEBRAIN ACROSS CHILDHOOD
How does the brain change across childhood ?
The brain weighs about 350 grams at birth and about 1,450 grams by adulthood. Theincrease in weight is mainly due to growth in dendritic branches. This is because thebasic structures of the brain are in place at birth, but the connections between neu-rons are still under developed.
How is our brain development dependent on our experience?
The synaptic connections between neurons are highly dependent on experience. In otherwords, the firing of neurons greatly influences the creation and strengthening of synap-tic connections. When our brain responds to its environment—be it a sensory, perceptu-al, emotional, or motor response—we are activating all the neurons in the relevant braincircuitry and causing them to fire. This activation then strengthens the synaptic connec-tions between them. As the saying goes, “Neurons that fire together, wire together.”
How are synapses formed or strengthened?
Synaptogenesis (the creation of synapses) involves multiple steps. New dendrites are
formed, thickening the dendritic branches of the neuron. New synapses are madewhen these dendritic branches make contact with other neurons’ axon terminals.Additionally, an existing synapse can be strengthened by the creation of new receptor
111BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR
What does it mean to say that the brain is plastic?
Plasticity of the brain refers to the brain’s ability to change with experience.As the very development of our brain is dependent upon our experience, we
can say that the human brain is very plastic. In fact, brain development inhumans is more experience-dependent than in any other species, reflecting thecentral role our capacity to learn has played in human evolution.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 111sites on the post synaptic neuron (the dendrite). These new receptor sites increase
sensitivity to the neurotransmitters released into the synaptic cleft.
What is pruning?
Experience affects brain development in two major ways. Activation of synaptic connec-tions strengthens the connections but lack of activation causes these connections to dieoff. The atrophy (or dying off) of unused connections is known as pruning. In short, thebrain has a “use it or lose it” policy. For example, a baby is born with the capacity to recog-nize all sounds of all languages on earth. With exposure to the child’s native language,however, the synapses activated by those sounds are strengthened, but the neural net-works related to other sounds weaken. Eventually the child’s brain has been wired torespond only to its own native language. Although a strong capacity to learn new lan-guages is retained throughout childhood, receptivity to new languages decreases with age.
What are critical periods?
The brain does not remain equally plastic throughout the lifespan. There are criticalperiods where the most growth takes place. The peak of synaptic growth occurs with-in the first two years of life but synaptogenesis continues at a rapid pace for the firstten years of life. If we think of how much learning takes place within the first two
112How can I maintain a healthy brain?
Agrowing body of research has yielded clues as to the best way to maintain ahealthy brain. This becomes especially important as the U.S. population is
living longer. In fact, the average lifespan in the United States has increased 32years over the course of the twentieth century. In the coming decades, therefore,we can expect far more people to live into their seventies, eighties, and ninetiesthan ever before. There are many ways to promote the brain’s health. Generalapproaches to healthy living reduce cardiovascular disease, which is one of themain culprits in dementia. Nutritious meals, regular exercise, and avoidance ofexcessive alcohol, weight gain, and smoking are all important. Exercise, in par-ticular, has been shown to protect cognition in older people, probably by pro-moting blood flow into the brain.
Good mental health is also important, as depression and excessive stress put
strain on the brain. Mental stimulation is helpful, as well. Keep in mind that thesefactors all work together. Mentally active people with good social support are morelikely to be happy and physically more active. Furthermore, you should not waituntil you retire to start healthy behavior. It is important to instill good habits whilestill young. At any given time, our brain reflects our entire lifetime of experience.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 112years of life—a child learns to walk, talk,
manipulate objects, and begins to under-stand the social world—it is not surpris-ing that this is a peak period of braingrowth. Children also remain extremelyopen to learning throughout the firstdecade; they learn to ride bicycles, followsocietal rules, and read and write. Ifthese tasks are not learned in childhood,it becomes much more difficult to learnthem later on.
What happens if learning does not
take place during the critical
periods?
Learning does not stop after the age often and the ability to form new memoriescontinues throughout the lifespan. How-ever, the brain networks laid down duringcritical periods are quite conservative anddifficult to change. Consider how easy itis for children under ten to learn a newlanguage and how comparatively difficultit is for their parents to do the samething. This is often the case in immigrant families, where the children’s ability tolearn the new language far outstrips that of their parents.
What role does myelination play?
Myelin is a fatty sheath that covers the surface of axon fibers and acts as a kind of insu-lation. Myelination increases the speed at which the action potential travels down the
axon. The myelination of axon fibers is not well developed at birth. Myelination con-tinues throughout childhood and myelination of the frontal lobe is not complete untilthe third decade of life.
How does the frontal lobe change across development?
The frontal lobe is one of the last areas of the brain to reach full maturity. In fact thefrontal lobe does not complete synaptic formation and myelination until the mid-twenties. In this regard, ontogeny does recapitulate phylogeny; in both developmentand evolution the frontal lobe is a late comer. This is entirely consistent with our
113BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR
As the rest of the body ages, so does the brain. The good news

lescents. While many brain functions, such as physical coordination and languageabilities, are fully mature by adolescence, social judgment and abstract thought takeconsiderably longer to mature.
How does the brain become more complex with development?
As new synapses are formed, the brain becomes more tightly networked. The maturebrain has trillions of synapses forming neural networks of extraordinary complexity.This complexity allows for much greater intellectual power and sophistication.Although children have an advantage over adults in their ability to take in and retainnew information, adults maintain a profound advantage over children in their abilityto process complex information. Thus, while children’s brains may be “little sponges”,adult brains permit much greater understanding of the world around them.
How does the brain change across the life span of an individual?
Experience continues to shape the brain throughout the life span, though the changestend to be more finely tuned later in life than in childhood and infancy. Nonetheless,the more you perform an action, think a thought, or feel a feeling, the more those cir-cuits are reinforced. Circuits that are not reinforced fall off. As such, the “use it or loseit” adage holds across the lifespan. Of course, core circuitry that is laid down in child-hood is conservative and difficult to change. That is why early learning and early emo-tional experience have such a profound effect on adult functioning.
THEAGING BRAIN
How does the brain age?
An unfortunate aspect of aging involves the gradual degeneration of most organs. Thebrain is no exception. There is an overall decrease in the speed, flexibility and efficien-cy of neuronal networks. There is atrophy and shrinking of many parts of the brain.However, the news is not all grim. Much can be done to preserve brain health in aging.
What is cortical atrophy?
Cortical atrophy refers to the shrinking of the neocortex that occurs with age. Thegyri (convolutions) shrink, the sulci (grooves between gyri) and the ventricles (vesselsfilled with cerebral spinal fluid) expand, and there is about a 17 percent decrease inbrain weight in both sexes by age eighty.
114Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 114Do cells die?
Brain cells seem to have a preprogrammed life span and cell death occurs throughout
the life span. However neuronal death is intensified in aging and neurogenesis, theproduction of new neurons, is slowed down.
What happens to the dendrites?
Another finding of aging involves the thinning of dendritic branching. This mayaccount for some of the atrophy of cerebral gray matter. Fewer dendrites mean fewersynapses for neurons to communicate with each other, which in turn reduces thespeed and efficiency of brain functions.
What impact does brain aging have on mental functioning?
The reduction in brain volume and density definitely has an impact on the agingadult’s cognitive functions. These changes correspond with decreased processingspeed, working memory, and psychomotor speed, and a reduced ability to commit newinformation to memory. However, many critical cognitive functions remain intact wellinto late life. Recognition memory, verbal skills, conceptual abilities, and general IQstay stable for a long time despite decreases in speed and raw processing power.
What is the difference between crystallized and fluid intelligence?
Psychologists make a distinction between crystallized intelligence, which remains sta-ble into old age, and fluid intelligence, which reduces with age. Crystallized intelli-gence involves verbal skills, conceptual skills, and fund of knowledge. Fluid intelli-gence involves immediate information processing skills, such as the speed at whichinformation is processed, the amount of information that can be processed at a time,and the ability to commit new information to memory.
Are there any benefits of an aging brain?
Although reductions in processing speed and memory efficiency are evident by middleage, there are some ways the brain improves with age. By the seventh or eighth decadeof life, a lifetime of experience is encoded in the brain’s neural networks. A lifetime ofsynaptic strengthening suggests better connectivity across the brain, better integra-tion of different brain areas. This translates into a more comprehensive understandingof the world in which we live. Moreover, enhanced cortical control of limbic responsessupports a more thoughtful response to emotion.

functioning. Nonetheless, there are more than a few people who remain healthy andvigorous even into their nineties.
Can the brain regenerate?
For a long time it was simply assumed that there was no production of new neuronsafter birth. More and more evidence shows that this is not the case. Certain areas ofthe brain, such as the hippocampus (an area critical for memory formation), producenew neurons throughout adulthood. We also know that dendritic branching andsynaptic development can occur throughout the lifespan. Neurogenesis (the creation
of new neurons) can be bolstered by physical exercise, diet, appropriate levels of restand relaxation, mental stimulation, and by certain medications, such as antidepres-sants, that act on the neurotransmitter known as serotonin.
What is Alzheimer’s disease?
Alzheimer’s disease is an age-related brain disease, in which abnormal growths calledneurofibrillary tangles and amaloid plaques destroy the brain’s ability to function
properly. These growths start in the hippocampus, where short-term memory is trans-lated into long-term memory. Thus the cardinal feature of Alzheimer’s is loss of mem-ory. As the disease progresses, other areas of the brain are affected and other psycho-Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 116BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR
117logical abilities deteriorate, including spatial orientation, executive functions, and
eventually speech. Alzheimer’s disease is a form of dementia, which refers to any con-dition that involves a permanent loss of cognitive abilities. While it is one of the mostcommon forms of dementia, it is not the only one, and other dementias, such as vas-cular dementia, can also cause cognitive decline in old age.
FROM BRAIN TO MIND
What can we know of how the brain creates the mind?
The brain is an extraordinarily intricate web of one hundred billion neurons. Some-how through the trillions of connections among these neurons, the phenomenon ofthe human mind emerges. Do we know how the mind comes out of the brain? Yes andno. We are learning more and more about what we call the neurobiological substrates
or correlates of mental life. We are learning which parts of the brain are active when
we do various mental functions. But correlation is not equal to causation. Justbecause two things happen together does not mean that we understand how one thingcauses the other. The fundamental mystery of how billions of mindless brain cells, orneurons, somehow come together to create consciousness continues to elude us.
What is qualia?
The concept of qualia relates to the question of subjectivity—what is the yellow of yel-
low, the green of green? Although we know a tremendous amount about how the brainprocesses light waves, we still have no idea how our own experience of yellow comes to
be. At present, many neuroscientists have agreed to put the question of qualia aside. Bystudying how different brain processes correlate with various mental processes, we can
still learn an inordinate amount about the relationship of brain and mind. This nextsection addresses what we do know about the links between the mind and the brain.
THE BRAIN AS MAPMAKER
How does the brain act as a mapmaker?
One critical way that the brain processes information is to create maps of the world
around it. From the brain stem up to the cortex, the brain processes information likea very detailed mapmaker. The brain passes information upstream in steps, movingfrom the lower-level, more simply organized regions to the higher-level, more com-plex regions. At each step, the new region maps the neural firing patterns of theregion below. It does this by recreating the spatial lay-out of the neurons of the otherHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 117118region. In this way, the brain builds a series of representations of both internal and
external reality. These maps then serve as guides for action. They help the brain toregulate the internal states of the body, respond to objects in the environment, andrespond to the neural patterns underlying our own thoughts and emotions. Anotherterm for map is representation. This term is used frequently in discussing the brain.
What does it mean to map something?
When an arrangement in space in one system mimics that of another system, the firstsystem is mapping the second. For example, when you draw two intersecting lines to
show a visitor how to get to your house, you are mapping the streets where you live.The brain uses time in its maps as well as space, however. The sequence of firing pat-
terns over time is also captured in the maps of the brain, similar to the way in which amusical theme repeats throughout a symphony.
How does the brain stem act as a mapmaker?
The brain stem maps information both from the outside world and from inside thebody. Nerves originating in the skin, muscles, skeletal system, blood vessels, and vis-cera (internal organs) all connect to neurons in the brain stem. The firing patterns ofthese nerves are then mirrored in the firing patterns of the brain stem neurons. Inthis way, the brain forms a representation of the internal state of the body, and thisrepresentation is updated on a moment-by-moment basis. Likewise, some types ofsensory information, such as sound and touch, are sent to the brain stem in the initialstages of perception.
What does the frontal cortex map?
The frontal cortex maps the activity of lower areas of the brain as the frontal lobe is richlyconnected to other brain regions. By coordinating information from so many diverse areasof the brain, the frontal lobe can map both internal and external reality in great detail.
SENSATION AND PERCEPTION
What is the difference between sensation and perception?
Sensation is the immediate mapping of raw sensory data, such as light patterns, soundwaves, or tactile stimulation. Perception is the next step in the process where all thatraw data is synthesized into more complex maps. These maps are then linked viamemory to similar maps drawn from past experience. This allows us to classify theimages into known categories, for example furniture, food, or animal. PerceptionHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 118What is blindsight?
Anumber of neurological disorders gives us clues as to the workings of the
brain. Visual agnosia, also known as blindsight, is a neurological disorder
that sheds light on how the brain makes sense of visual information. People withinjuries to the visual association cortex will be blind in the conventional sense ofthe word. They will not be able to recognize any objects visually. Likewise, theywill tell you that they cannot see anything. However, if you put a large object infront of their path, they will walk around it, all the while insisting that they donot see a thing. This suggests that fundamental information about the presenceand location of visual stimuli does get through. This preliminary information isprocessed in the primary visual cortex. However, the coordination of visualinformation into coherent, recognizable shapes takes place in the associationcortices. Therefore, injury in those regions results in visual agnosia. In effect, avisual agnosia is sensation without perception.
occurs when the initial sensory information is organized into a sufficiently completewhole (or gestalt) that it can be recognized as an object. At this point, we recognizethat the pattern of light waves hitting our retina is actually a chair. Thus sensationworks by analysis—by breaking down information into its smallest parts. Perceptionworks by synthesis, by coordinating the parts back into a whole.
How does the brain process sensory information?
Our initial sensory information comes from physical stimulation from the outsideworld. This might come in the form of light waves or sound waves or physical pressureagainst our skin. This information is picked up by our sense organs, for example oureyes, ears, nose, skin, or tongue. Our sense organs then relay this information to theprimary sensory cortices via the thalamus. The thalamus acts as a gating station,
blocking information it identifies as unimportant and passing on information it deemsimportant. This is true for all our senses except the sense of smell (olfaction) whichgoes directly to the olfactory bulb, bypassing the thalamus and the cortex. The prima-ry visual cortex is in the occipital lobe, the primary auditory (hearing) cortex is in thetemporal lobe, and the primary sensory cortex (for touch and taste) is in the parietallobe. The primary sensory cortex is known as the somatosensory strip.
What do the primary sensory cortices do?
The primary sensory cortical areas register the most fundamental aspects of sensation,such as the orientation of a line, the location of a touch, the frequency of a soundwave. Information about these fundamental sensory properties is then passed onto theBRAIN AND BEHAVIOR
119Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 119association cortices, where it is synthesized into a larger whole. In this way sensation
moves toward perception.
Does the brain also process sensory information from inside our bodies?
Sensory information does not only come from outside the body. We also need sensoryinformation about the state of our body. We need to know if we are feeling dizzy or sick toour stomachs, or if our heart is beating fast. This tells us important information about ourhealth but also tells us about our emotions. Part of the way that we know what we are feel-ing is through sensory information about our internal bodily states. In fact, there are neu-rons throughout the gastro-intestinal system—so many that it is sometimes called oursecond brain. The brain stem, somatosensory strip and insula (a cortical area on the insideof the cortex) are involved with processing sensory information from inside our body.
How does the brain process perception?
It is important to understand that the brain does not work like a camera, simply pho-tographing outside reality. As mentioned above, the brain constructs its own version
of reality by constructing a map of the world around it. In the primary sensory cor-tices, neurons respond to patterns of stimulation, for example, with cells that fire inresponse to horizontal, vertical, or diagonal lines. This information is then sent to theassociation cortices, where the firing patterns of the different cells are coordinatedwith each other to establish a broader pattern. When this information is sent to theparts of the brain associated with memory, language, and emotion, we are both able torecognize and label an object as well as appreciate what meaning it might have for us.In this way, the brain constructs an interpretation or map of reality that is deeply con-nected to our personal experience and history.
What are association cortices and what role do they play in perception?
The association cortices are the cortical areas that synthesize the fundamental units ofsensation into larger patterns and towards a recognizable whole. The visual associationcortex is in the occipital lobe, just anterior to the primary visual cortex. The auditoryassociation cortex is in the temporal lobe, close to the primary auditory cortex. Theassociation cortex for touch is next to the somatosensory strip in the parietal cortex, inthe brain regions known as S2 and S3.
After sensory information is pro cessed in the unimodal (single sense) association
areas, it is sent to the multimodal association areas , where information from differ-
ent sensory modalities can be coordinated. For example, information about the sightof a chair as well as the sound and the feel of your body as you sit down in it is coordi-nated into the unified perception of a single object. Simultaneously, activation of thehippocampus and parts of the temporal cortex jog our memory, allowing us to place
120Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 120our perception in the context of our
memories. Thus, this particular object isrecognized as a chair.
Do different people perceive the
same event differently?
As mentioned above, the brain does notrecord reality like a camera; it constructsa representation of reality through analy-sis and synthesis of sensory information.Therefore, each person’s perception of anygiven event will be unique, which explainswhy people can have such differing mem-ories of the same event. Even if the samesensory information is available to twodifferent people, the unique history ofeach person’s brain will ensure that thefinal perception of each individual will dif-fer, colored by variations in the individu-als’ attention, memories, emotionalstates, etc. Moreover, the exact sensoryinformation in any given event will neverbe identical for any two people becausethe position in space of each person’s body will necessarily differ. All these factors willcontinue to color the memory of the event at later times. This is well understood inlegal contexts and is the reason that eye witness testimony can be highly problematic.
How does the brain process vision?
One-third of the brain is used to process visual information, which tells us just howimportant vision is to human beings. The processing of visual information starts inthe eyes, the visual sense organs. On the retina, the inner back surface of the eye,there are a number of neurons that are specialized to fire in response to light. Thesespecific cells are called rods and cones. Rods respond to night vision and process infor-
mation in shades of black, white and gray. Cones fire in bright light and respond tocolor. The axons of rods and cones connect to other cells in the retina, where somepreliminary visual processing is done. These neurons then connect to ganglion cells,whose axons bundle together, like wires in a cable, to form the optic nerve.
The optic nerve exits through the back of the retina and travels to the brain. All
the ganglion cells that respond to the right side of the visual field will go to the leftside of the brain. Likewise the ganglion cells that respond to the left side of the visualfield will go to the right side of the brain. Any ganglion axon that needs to cross over
121BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR
What meets the eye is not always perceived the same from
person to person. The external world that people see and hearand touch and smell is interpreted differently as it is filteredthrough each individual’s emotions, memories, and cognitiveprocesses (iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 121to the opposite side of the brain is able to do so at the optic chiasm, in the middle of
the brain. The two branches of the optic nerve next connect to the correspondinglobes of the thalamus. The thalamus is the gate keeper for sensory information. Basedon feedback from the cortex, the thalamus lets some information through to activateneurons connected to the cortex but stops other messages in their tracks. Neurons inthe thalamus send visual information up to the primary visual cortex in the occipitallobe, known as VI or Brodman area 17. From there, the fundamental features of thevisual stimulus are processed. As discussed above, these neurons connect to associa-tion cortices where the basic visual features are then synthesized into larger patterns.
How does the brain process sound ?
The ear is composed of three sections, the outer ear , the middle ear, and the inner
ear. The outer flap that we normally think of as the ear is called the pinna. That andthe ear canal, the long inner tunnel where our wax collects, comprise the outer ear.The ear canal ends in the ear drum, a thin membrane that stretches across the backend of the ear canal. The middle ear consists of three tiny, delicate bones that transfersound vibrations from the ear drum to the cochlea, a fluid-filled spiral that translatessound vibrations into neural activity. The cochlea and the vestibular apparatus, whichsenses balance and motion, comprise the inner ear. Sound vibrations are captured bythe pinna, channeled back to the middle ear by the ear canal, and communicated tothe cochlea via the bones of the middle ear.
The fluid-filled cochlea is lined with hair cells, a type of sensory neuron that
responds to sounds of specific frequencies. High frequencies (which translate into high
122What is prosopagnosia?
An elderly man was admitted to a hospital. The staff soon noticed that he becameagitated when walking by pictures hanging on the walls. These were framed
prints encased in glass. When passing by the picture, he would catch a reflection ofhimself and then turn and start yelling, “Get away from me! Leave me alone!” Hewould ask the nurses plaintively, “Why does that man keep following me?”
This man suffered from a disorder known as prosopagnosia, which refers to
the inability to recognize faces. This bizarrely specific disorder is due to lesionsin the fusiform gyrus , a multimodal association region that is located at the bot-
tom of the temporal lobe. The fusiform gyrus integrates perceptual informationabout faces into recognizable wholes. When this region is damaged, the personcannot perceive faces as a recognizable whole but only as a collection of visualparts. Some readers may be familiar with this disorder from Oliver Sacks’s bookThe Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 122pitched sounds) are recorded by hair cells at the opening of the spiral cochlea, middle
frequencies in the middle of the cochlea, and low frequencies by hair cells at the end ofthe spiral. The hair cells send information to the spinal cord, which then connects toseveral regions in the brain stem. Here the auditory information is processed for thetiming and intensity. These neurons connect to the inferior colliculus in the mid-brain,where some further analysis takes place. The inferior colliculus connects to the gate-keeping thalamus. Finally, the auditory information enters the cortex at the primaryauditory cortex (A1), located in the superior and posterior (upper rear) temporal lobe.Association areas are nearby, including the regions that deal with language.
Why do some people hear voices that aren’t really there?
One of the most common symptoms of schizophrenia and other psychotic disordersinvolves auditory hallucinations. This occurs when someone hears sounds that haveno basis in external reality. People can hear voices talking to them—sometimes a sin-gle voice, sometimes an entire chorus of voices. The voices can maintain an ongoingcommentary on the person’s behavior, can make derogatory statements, call the per-son names, or even instruct the person on what to do.
The most elaborate auditory hallucinations are associated with schizophrenia.
Researchers have found that the auditory cortex is active when a person is hearing voic-es. In this way the brain actually ishearing voices although the sensory information
does not come from the ear but from inside the person’s brain. It is believed that halluci-natory voices actually derive from the person’s thoughts. The thoughts get translatedinto a kind of inner speech, which the brain hears as if it were hearing actual speech.
While inner speech is a common phenomenon, healthy brains can distinguish
between inner speech and spoken words. In psychosis, however, the distinctionbetween inner and outer reality is lost.For reasons we do not fully understand,antipsychotic medication restores theability to make the critical distinctionbetween imagined and external reality.
How does the brain process touch ?
The sensory organs for all of our othersenses are relatively small. Consider thesize of the ears, nose, or eyes. The sensoryorgan that processes touch, however, cov-ers our whole body. Our entire skin func-tions as the sensory organ for touch. Ourskin is covered with many different senso-ry receptor cells. Some are specialized to

smell than humans, whose olfactory bulbs are correspondinglysmaller and process less information ( iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 123sense changes in physical pressure, some to vibrations, some to pain, and others to
temperature. These neurons send information to the cortex via a fairly long pathway,running through the spinal cord, areas in the mid brain, and the thalamus. The prima-ry sensory area for touch is called the somatosensory strip (S1) in the anterior (front)area of the parietal lobe. Neurons responding to touch on different areas of the body aremapped along the somatosensory strip. This map is known as the homunculus (“little
man” in Latin). Association cortices for touch (e.g., S2 and S3) are adjacent to S1.
How does the brain process smell?
The sense of smell is processed in the olfactory system, which is an evolutionarilyancient system, dating back hundreds of millions of years. The olfactory systemresponds to airborne chemicals, which waft into the nose. The olfactory nerve con-nects the olfactory receptor cells in the nose to the olfactory bulbs, two small struc-tures on either side of the brain just below the frontal lobe. From the olfactorybulbs, axons bundled together into the olfactory nerves project to various parts ofthe limbic system. From there, neurons connect to other subcortical areas such asthe thalamus, hypothalamus, and insula. Thus, the olfactory nerve sends informa-tion directly to the emotional centers of the brain, without the filtering role of thethalamus or the cortex. The olfactory bulb plays a much larger role in simpler andphylogenetically older animals than it does in phylogenetically younger and morecomplex animals like primates.
What about taste?
Our subjective experience of taste is actually a combination of taste and smell. If yousever the olfactory nerve, removing the sense of smell, your ability to taste your foodwill be much reduced. You will only be able to taste sweet, bitter, salt, and sour flavors.There is now evidence for a fifth type of taste category, however, which has beennamed umami. This is a Japanese word meaning delicious, savory, or meaty. Umamiseems related to monosodium glutamate (MSG), a food additive used extensively inEast Asian cuisine.
All of these taste categories have survival value. Sweet, umami, and salty tastes
enhance our intake of carbohydrate, protein, and salt, respectively. Excessive amountsof bitter or sour taste alert us to decaying or toxic food. The relative amounts of thetaste qualities of any food put in the mouth are sensed by the taste buds (gustatory
papillae), tiny protrusions that cover the surface of the tongue. The taste buds aresomewhat specialized to specific taste qualities, but generally respond to more thanone aspect of taste (e.g., both salty and sweet). The taste buds carry information to thecranial nerves, which connect to neurons in the brain stem, which then connect toneurons in the thalamus. These project (or connect) to a particular area in thesomatosensory strip specialized for the tongue.
124Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 124MOTOR BEHAVIOR
AND INTENTIONAL ACTION
How does our brain generate motor behavior?
Physical action, also called motor behavior, is the output side of the input/output sys-
tem of the brain. Sensation/perception is our input and action is our output. Ourphysical behavior ranges from simple reflexive movements up to intentional, planned,and complex movements.
What is the difference between voluntary and involuntary movements?
Voluntary movements are those movements that are potentially under conscious con-
trol. Examples include walking, standing up, raising our arm, getting dressed, shakingour head, etc. Involuntary movements are those movements that are not under con-
scious control or that generally happen automatically without conscious thought.Examples include breathing, heartbeat, posture, and motor coordination.
How does the brain process involuntary movements ?
Different tracts of neurons are involved with voluntary and involuntary movements. Invol-untary movements are processed largely through a group of brain cells known as extra-
pyramidal neurons. They connect input from the cerebellum and the inner ear to the
brain stem. The first two areas process information about coordination and balance. Thebrain stem sends this information to motor neurons in the spinal cord, which connectdirectly to the muscles involved. Thus, information related to involuntary movement doesnot go through the cortex and generally travels in a relatively simple, closed circuit.
How does psychiatric medication affect extra-pyramidal neurons?
Antipsychotic medication can disrupt the function of extra-pyramidal neurons. Thiscan result in disfiguring side effects, such as tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome character-ized by tremors in the extremities and facial muscles. The atypical antipsychotics, anew class of medication, have now become popular because they produce fewer extra-pyramidal side effects (e.g., restlessness, tremor, and muscular stiffness).
How does the brain mediate voluntary movements?
While sensory information moves more or less from the back to the front of the brain,motor information moves in the opposite direction. Goals for physical action areprocessed in the pre-frontal cortex, the seat of planning and goal setting. This infor-mation is sent back to the pre-motor cortex and the supplemental motor area, which
125BRAIN AND BEHAVIORHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 125126lie just in front of the primary motor cortex. Coordination of the specific movements
appears to take place in these areas.
This information is then transmitted to the primary motor cortex (or M1), which
lies just in front of the central sulcus, next to the somatosensory strip of the parietal
lobe. The surface of the body is mapped along M1, creating a similar homunculus tothe one found next door in the somatosensory strip. This region is linked to the actualexecution of the movement. M1 sends information to the brain stem, which then acti-
vates motor neurons in the spinal cord. These in turn connect directly to the muscles.
Does information only move in one direction?
It is important to understand that the brain is continuously giving and receiving feed-back. Information is always moving up and down the system and modifying both inputand output. For example, the motor system sends out a signal to move and the lefthand reaches out to grasp a glass. Simultaneously, the brain processes important sen-sory feedback. The hand is too far to the left of the glass, the pinky finger brushesagainst the back of a chair. This feedback is automatically incorporated into the ongo-ing movement, and the hand is moved half an inch to the right. The impact of this newmovement is then encoded into new sensory information. For the sake of simplicity,our sensory and motor systems are presented here as if they act in isolation. In reality,though, the brain is a giant web of interacting systems giving itself constant feedback.
What role does the cerebellum play?
The cerebellum, which is Latin for “little brain,” is the large, bulbous structure locatedbelow the back of the cortex. With rich connections to both the frontal lobe and the brainstem, it is integrally involved in motor control. The cerebellum mediates motor coordina-tion, posture, and the smooth flow of movement. Damage to the cerebellum results injerky, uncoordinated movements and problems with balance. More recent research hasrevealed that the cerebellum is involved with a range of cognitive functions as well.
Is imagined movement different than actual movement?
Surprisingly, the brain processes observed movement and imagined movement inmuch the same way it processes actual movement. Brain imaging studies have shownthat the same areas of the motor cortex are activated when people witness an action inanother person, imagine performing the same action themselves, or actually performthe action themselves.
What are mirror neurons?
Mirror neurons are a group of neurons found in the premotor cortex that respond
both to witnessed movements in other animals and to the analogous movement in theHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 126What is a phantom pain?
People who have lost their limbs

feeling pain where the limb used tobe. This phenomenon is known asphantom limb pain . Such an experi-
ence can be very distressing as itcompounds an already devastatingloss. Brain imaging studies haveshown that phantom limb sensationis related to activity in the soma -tosensory strip and the sensory asso-ciation cortices nearby. Neurons inthe spinal cord still send pain signalsto the parts of the brain that processsensory information from the ampu-tated limb. This does not apply tojust pain. For people who have losttheir hands can imagine movingtheir fingers. When they do so, thecorresponding area of the motorstrip in the brain is activated as if thehand is still there.
People who have had a limb or other body part amputated
can still experience sensations like pain because the nerves inthe spinal cord corresponding to that area of the body can stillsend signals to the brain ( iStock).
self. Similar neurons have also been found in the sensory association cortex in the
parietal lobe. Some scientists have suggested that mirror neurons might be the basisof empathy. Mirror neurons were discovered when scientists implanted electrodes inmonkeys’ brains to measure the electrical activity of single neurons. The cells firedboth when the monkey made a particular hand movement and when the experimentermade the same hand movement. The cells did not fire when the experimenter made adifferent hand movement.
Does the brain process complex behavior differently than simple behavior?
The frontal lobe is not the only source of complex goal-oriented movement. As dis-cussed above, the frontal lobe is a recent evolutionary achievement and is most fullydeveloped in humans. Prior to the evolution of the frontal lobe, however, animalsneeded some way to perform goal-oriented behaviors. Prey had to be hunted, hygienemaintained, food eaten, and social behaviors performed. In most animals, these behav-BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR
127Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 127iors were patterned into fairly fixed packets of behaviors that would be released rather
automatically in the face of the appropriate stimulus. The mouse runs across the floorand the cat pounces. The part of the brain associated with these pre-set behavioralpackets is known as the basal ganglia.
What role does the basal ganglia play?
The basal ganglia refers to a group of brain structures which include the caudate
nucleus, the putamen and the globus pallidus . This is an evolutionarily ancient brain
region that precedes the evolution of the cortex and is found in mammals, birds, andeven reptiles. The basal ganglia mediates simple motor programs. These are packets ofmovements that serve a purpose—riding a bike, throwing a ball, etc. Some of theseautomatic behaviors are learned (e.g., riding a bike) and some are unlearned, based ongenetics. The unlearned motor programs are also known as fixed action patterns. Inhumans, the basal ganglia is heavily involved with learned motor programs. Althoughcomplex behaviors are learned via the frontal lobe, with practice the behavior becomesmore automatic and the basal ganglia comes into play.
What are fixed action patterns and what do they tell us about our
“animal instincts”?
A fixed action pattern is a genetically-coded behavioral sequence that is triggered by
specific stimuli. Fixed action patterns are analogous to animal “instincts” and aremediated by the basal ganglia. The behavior is fixed and relatively unmodifiable. Thereis very little goal correction; the behavior is a set response to a set stimulus.
What examples of fixed action patterns do we see in animals?
For example, cats smell their urine and start digging in cat litter to bury their waste.They rarely check the results of their efforts to see if they have met their goal; theysimply respond in a preprogrammed way to a set stimulus, in this case the smell oftheir urine or feces. Grooming behavior in multiple animals provides additional exam-ples of fixed action patterns. Birds preen themselves, cats lick themselves, and dogsshake themselves when wet. Additional examples include gnawing behavior in pigsand horses whinnying and shaking their heads.
What fixed action patterns do we see in humans?
In humans, we see reflexes at birth (rooting, swimming, grasping, and sucking). Withdevelopment, however, these basal ganglia-mediated reflexes get suppressed by thefrontal lobe. For the most part, thoughtful, intentional behavior replaces automaticstimulus-response chains. In adulthood, fixed action patterns can re-emerge if there isdamage to the frontal lobe. Frontal release signs, which are associated with frontal lobe
128Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 128damage, include several reflexes that we normally see only in early infancy. Certain psy-
chiatric conditions may also reflect pathological activation of fixed action patterns. Forexample, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) has been linked to basal ganglia-frontallobe circuits. It is characterized by repetitive, stereotyped, and senseless behaviors,such as compulsive hand-washing, tapping, straightening, or organizing behavior.
COGNITION AND BEHAVIORAL CONTROL
How does cognition serve to regulate behavior?
What is cognition? How do we define thought? At base, cognition involves the repre-
sentation of events and the mental manipulation of events outside of immediate reali-ty. In other words, the use of imagination. If you can imagine the outcome of anaction, you can evaluate whether or not it is worthwhile to take such an action. Or youcan imagine alternative actions that can be taken. These abilities dramatically changethe animal’s relationship with action. With cognition, human beings are able to thinkbefore they act and to correct their mistakes. They are also able to plan future actionsand to anticipate possible outcomes.
What does goal-correction mean?
Cognition also allows us to compare the actual outcome of an action with the desiredoutcome and then modify the action accordingly. This process is called goal-correction.
What are executive functions?
Executive functions are a set of mental abilities that are mediated by the frontal lobes.
These include planning, analyzing, considering alternative actions, abstraction,changing sets, etc. These critical mental functions help people adapt to a complex andever-changing environment. When the frontal lobe is damaged, people lose executivefunctions. They become more impulsive, disorganized, unable to plan, and unable tomonitor and regulate their own behavior. In effect they become more childlike,regressing to a time when the frontal lobe was less developed.
How does impulse control relate to executive functions?
Impulse control is also critical. Specifically, this involves the linking of representationsof events with memories or expectations of punishment. The person can consider thenegative consequences of an intended action and inhibit or alter the action accordingly.People with poor impulse control often do poorly on neuropsychological tests that mea-sure executive functions like abstraction, set switching, and planning. Impulse control ismediated by the orbital frontal cortex, which lies on the underside of the frontal lobe.

Phineas Gage (1823–1860) was a railroad worker living in the mid-nineteenth century
who suffered a terrible accident while at work. An iron rod crashed through his head, tear-ing a large hole through his brain. Surprisingly, he survived this incident and in fact wasrelatively unharmed physically. His cognition and motor control were reasonably intact.However, there were marked personality changes that were very disturbing to those whohad known him prior to the accident. While he had once been a sober and well-behavedcitizen, after the accident he became rude, impulsive, and socially inappropriate. We nowunderstand that he suffered from orbital frontal damage, with severe damage to the areasof the brain centrally involved with impulse control and social judgment.
EMOTIONS
What are emotions?
We can think of emotions as behavioral packets for social animals. They are a veryquick and efficient way to respond to different circumstances in the environment.Such circumstances might include aversive conditions, such as danger or aggression,or rewarding conditions such as food, sex, safety, or social bonds. All emotional reac-tions involve coordination of several features. These include autonomic nervous sys-tem arousal, facial expression, muscular tension, and subjective experience. This pack-et of responses is almost like a computer macro that serves as preparation for a specificsituation. For example, when people are angry their blood pumps faster, their facebecomes flush, their brow furrows, their mouth purses, the large muscles in theirarms and legs tense, and they have the distinct subjective experience of anger. In thisway, their body is prepared not only for action, but for aggressive action in particular.
What purposes do emotions serve?
All emotions serve at least three purposes: they prepare the individual for appropriateaction; they alert the individual of the salience (or significance) of the situation; theycommunicate to others how the individual is reacting. For example, in a situation ofdanger, the emotional response of fear alerts the individual to the danger of the situa-tion, prepares the individual for physical flight, and communicates to other people viafacial expression, vocalization, and physical posture that the individual senses danger.
What are the different classes of emotions?
The core emotions are generally recognized to be anger, fear, disgust, surprise, joy,and sadness. These are biologically encoded, unlearned human responses that areimmediately recognizable regardless of linguistic or cultural differences. Many of
130Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 130these emotions, such as fear and anger, are also found in other mammals. However,
the palette of human emotions is broader than these six core emotions. Self-consciousemotions—such as shame, embarrassment, pride, or guilt—are also part of thehuman emotional repertoire. These more complex emotions depend upon a certaindegree of cognitive development and relate to one’s place in the social group.
Do we always know what we are feeling?
Feeling something and knowing what we are feeling are two different things. In fact,the neuroscientist Antonio Damasio makes a distinction between emotion, which is
the body’s physiological response, and feeling, which is the conscious experience of
emotion. Infants are born with emotional responses—they are literally born crying. Incontrast, the ability to recognize and verbally label emotion (“Oh, I’m feeling sad.”) issomething that develops with age and is to some extent dependent on appropriatesocial feedback. Relatedly, the basis of psychodynamic psychotherapy is the idea thatemotional maladjustment comes from lack of knowledge of one’s own emotions. Theinability to recognize one’s own emotions is called alexythymia.
EMOTION AND THE LIMBIC SYSTEM
How is the limbic system involved in emotion?
Our knowledge of the neurobiology of emotion is far less developed than our knowledgeof the role of the brain in cognition. But we do know that the group of brain structurescalled the limbic system is centrally involved with emotion. The limbic system refers to
a group of subcortical brain structures that wrap around the thalamus. Although thereis disagreement about the exact boundaries of the limbic system, the term is usuallyunderstood to include core brain structures involved in the processing of emotion.
What role does the amygdala play in emotion?
The amygdala is a small, almond shaped structure that lies just below the basal gan-glia (“amygdala” is Greek for “almond”). The amygdala is a critical player in emotion-al reactions. It is an early responder to emotionally salient stimuli, particularly fear-ful stimuli. The amygdala has rich connections with other limbic areas as well aslower brain regions, such as the midbrain and the brain stem. In particular, it hasmany connections to neurons in the midbrain, which manufacture neurotransmit-ters highly relevant to emotional life.
For example, the raphe nucleus generates serotonin, the ventral tegmental area
dopamine, and the locus ceruleus norepinephrine. Most psychiatric drugs target oneor more of these neurotransmitter systems. The amygdala also connects to the frontal
131BRAIN AND BEHAVIORHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 131132and temporal lobes. In this way, the amygdala acts as a way station between the think-
ing and perceiving areas of the brain and the physiological control centers.
What is the HPA axis?
The HPA axis is one major route by which the hypothalamus can step on the gaspedal and rev the body up. The HPA axis includes the hypothalamus, pituitary gland,
and adrenal glands . This triad is centrally involved in the stress response of the body.
The pituitary gland is a small structure below the hypothalamus and the adrenalglands lie just above the kidneys. The hypothalamus secretes a hormone known ascortisol releasing hormone (CRH), which travels down to the pituitary gland, whereit stimulates the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). This is turn travelsdown to the adrenal glands, where it stimulates the release of cortisol and other cor-ticosteroids. These hormones activate the sympathetic nervous system. Cortisolinfluences many psychological responses, including stress, mood, and some forms ofmental illness.
How does the hypothalamus act as the gateway to the autonomic 
nervous system?
One of the brain regions that the amygdala connects to is the hypothalamus. This
important structure is involved with motivational drives such as hunger, sex, andthirst and also serves as a coordinator for the physiological centers of the brain. Thehypothalamus is the master control center for the autonomic nervous system. This
whole body system gears the body up for action by mobilizing the cardiovascular, res-piratory, muscular, and gastro-intestinal systems.
The work of the autonomic nervous system is evident when we feel emotionally
aroused. Our heart beats faster, we start to sweat, our stomach churns, and our breathgrows rapid and shallow. (More specifically, this is the work of the sympathetic ner-vous system, which speeds us up. The parasympathetic nervous system slows usdown.) The hypothalamus activates the autonomic nervous system in two major ways.The first is the more traditional route of synaptic connections between neurons. Thesecond is through the release of hormones, free-floating chemical messengers thatlargely travel through the blood stream.
How does the hippocampus affect emotional processing?
The hippocampus is involved with memory, which is critical to our evaluation of anynew stimulus. Have I encountered this person/situation/object before? Is this friend orfoe? Although the hippocampus is not directly involved in emotion, it is located nearthe other limbic structures and has neuronal connections with several of them,including the amygdala, the hypothalamus, and the cingulate gyrus.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 132Many mammal species are very social. These elephants, for instance, are engaging in affectionate social behavior. Our emotions
evolved in large part to help us negotiate the social world ( iStock.com).How does the insula provide information about internal bodily states?
The insula is involved with the representation of internal bodily states. It helps process
sensory information from inside our bodies, for example butterflies in our stomach orcramps in our intestines. More specifically it has been associated with the processing ofaversive food tastes and the related experience of disgust. The insula is located on theinside of the cortex, surrounded by the temporal, frontal, and parietal lobes. Brainimaging studies have shown that this region is activated in many different emotionalstates. This is because sensory information about the physical state of the body plays acritical part in the subjective awareness of emotion. Try to remember the times whenyou have felt intensely happy, angry, or frightened. Do you recall the sensation ofchanges in muscle tension, energy level, heartbeat, etc? Can you imagine experiencingintense emotions without feeling these bodily changes? In sum, the amygdala andhypothalamus primarily provide emotional output—they activate the emotionalresponses. In contrast, the insula gives emotional input. It helps translate biological
emotion into conscious feeling by giving us information about what our body is doing.
EMOTIONS IN MAMMALS
How are our emotions rooted in our mammalian history?
Emotions are part of the evolutionary tool kit of mammals. Mammals are, for the mostpart, very social animals and emotions help in the core aspects of social functioning.BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR
133Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 133134For example, emotions cement social bonds, in the interest of both mating and par-
enting. They support intra-species competition, as when animals compete for status,resources and mates. They also offer invaluable help in responding to and communi-cating danger and, finally, they give us information as to how other group membersare responding to ourselves and to the environment.
What emotions are evident in higher mammals?
Core emotions are clearly evident in our household pets, our cats and dogs, which iswhy we grow so attached to them. Affection, aggression, fear, contentment, and excite-ment are all impossible to miss. When a dog wags its tail and assumes a play position, itis hard not to respond with positive emotion. Likewise, when our pet cat rubs againstus and purrs, this typically elicits a similarly content and affectionate response.
How do human emotions differ from animal emotions?
Because of our greater brain complexity, our emotions tend to be more nuanced and com-plex, more influenced by cognition and by our considerations of the past and the future.Animal emotions are simpler, more directly tied to actions and to the here and now. Dogsmay growl at a stranger, rub against a beloved and trusted owner, or wag their tails at asign that they are about to be taken for a walk. In contrast, human emotion is much lesstied to the present. We regret the past and worry about the future. And our emotionalresponses are not restricted to our immediate environment. Human beings might becomedepressed after reading a newspaper article on global warming, worry about what theirfriends think of their lovers, or feel jealous of a high school friend’s success at work.
Has the limbic system changed much across evolution?
The limbic system, the seat of emotions, has not changed as much as the frontal lobeacross evolution. Our cortex is quite different from that of our mammalian cousins;our limbic system is not. This is why we can make emotional attachments to animalsof different species. Even though our intellectual brains are vastly different, our emo-tional brains are relatively similar.
FRONTAL CONTROL OF THE LIMBIC SYSTEM
How does the frontal lobe control the limbic system?
The frontal lobe serves to control the limbic system. Correspondingly, thought servesto control emotion. The frontal lobe is richly connected to brain regions throughoutthe limbic system and many frontal lobe neurons that connect to limbic regions haveHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 134Are Freud’s ego and id concepts rooted in biological fact?
Much of psychoanalytic theory has required modification since Sigmund
Freud’s original work. Nonetheless, Freud’s concepts of the ego and the id
have held up remarkably well over these past 100 years. The ego is the seat of thereality principle. It helps us adapt our wishes and urges to cold reality. The id, onthe other hand, is the seat of our most primitive and animalistic desires. It is thesource of our passions. As is suggested by Freud’s famous phrase “Where id was,there shall ego be,” the ego serves to control the id.
Surprisingly, modern neuroscience has completely supported this notion.
The id can be equated with the limbic system, the seat of our emotions. The egocan be equated with the frontal lobe, or, more specifically, the pre-frontal cortex,which mediates cognition and behavioral control. Just as the ego serves to con-trol the id, the frontal lobe serves to control the limbic system.BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR
135inhibitory effects. Emotions are blunt instruments—they are very fast, but not veryprecise. The frontal lobe helps us refine our emotional responses; to ensure that ourresponses are proportional to the situation. This is done with the use of thought, byinterjecting thought between emotion and response.
Sometimes cognitive analysis of the situation may increase the emotional
response. Think of the times when your initial response to a situation was muted butthen escalated the more you thought about what happened. On the other hand, cogni-tive analysis frequently serves to dampen the emotional response by helping the indi-vidual consider the consequences of acting on emotions. ( If I punch him, he might
punch back. If I quit my job, I won’t be able to pay my rent.) Cognition also helpspeople consider alternative explanations for a situation. (Hmmm, maybe this wasn’tan insult. Maybe he just didn’t see me.)
What role does the orbital frontal region play?
The orbital frontal region lies on the underside of the frontal lobe, just above the eyes. This
brain region is particularly important for impulse control, for the inhibition of dangerousor reckless actions. People with damage to their orbital frontal cortex show disinhibited,impulsive, and socially unacceptable behavior. The case of Phineas Gage is a famous exam-ple of orbital frontal damage. Orbital frontal inhibition probably works through linkingrepresentations of future events with representations of past or future punishment.
What is the role of the superior medial frontal cortex?
New research suggests that a part of the frontal lobe, the superior medial frontal cor-
tex, is involved with social cognition via connecting emotional memories with cogni-Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 135136tion. This part of the brain, which lies in the middle of the frontal lobe, has been
linked to the perception of self, of others, and of mental states. Although this researchis still fairly new, it may be quite radical, in that it provides the first evidence of theneurobiological substrates of certain aspects of personality.
Does an immature frontal lobe mean poor emotional regulation ?
As the frontal lobe is the last to develop across childhood, and in fact is not fully devel-oped until adulthood, emotional control also does not fully mature until adulthood.This is intuitively obvious if we think of the relative emotional immaturity of childrenand even adolescents.
What happens when the frontal lobe deteriorates?
When the frontal lobe deteriorates, we can see re-emergence of more primitive behav-iors that had previously been inhibited by the frontal lobe. The Babinski reflex and
frontal release signs are examples of this. Likewise, there is less control over primitivelimbic responses. Consequently, the person loses social judgment, impulse control,and the ability to plan and to analyze situations effectively. This is why people withAlzheimer’s disease or other dementias need continuous supervision. When thefrontal lobe goes, the person in effect regresses to childhood.
What are frontal release signs?
The frontal release signs refer to a group of reflexive behaviors, controlled by the basal
ganglia, which are normally evident only in earliest infancy. Examples of these behav-iors include rooting (turning the face toward an object if it touches the cheek near themouth) and puckering of the lips in response to touch of the skin above the upper lip.These instinctual behaviors promote nursing behavior in an infant.
The palmar grasp reflex helps an infant hold onto its mother. In this reaction, the
infant grasps at anything that strokes its palm. The Babinski reflex, in which the footarches away from tactile stimulation on the sole of the foot, is another of these earlyreflexes. With development of the frontal lobe, these crude automatic behaviors aresuppressed. When there is damage to the frontal lobe in adulthood, however, theseearly reflexes may re-emerge. The presence of frontal release signs in adulthood,therefore, is a sign of significant brain damage.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 136NEUROTRANSMITTERS AND
OTHER BRAIN CHEMICALS
What are neurotransmitters and why are they important?
Neurotransmitters are perhaps the main chemical messengers in the brain. They are
the means by which neurons communicate with each other. It is through neurotrans-mitters that one neuron tells another neuron to fire. If we think of the neuronal net-works of the brain as a vast economy, neurotransmitters can be seen as the currencyof that economy. The exchange of neurotransmitters stimulates neurons to act.
How do neurotransmitters act at synapses?
Neurotransmitters are stored in sac-like vesicles in the axon terminals of the neuron.When the neuron fires, its axon terminals release neurotransmitters into the synapticcleft, the space between the pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neuron. When the neuro-transmitters bind to the receptor sites on the post-synaptic neuron, they impact thelikelihood that the neuron will fire. Excitatory neurotransmitters increase the likeli-hood of firing while inhibitory neurotransmitters decrease it.
What are the main neurotransmitters?
Dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin are probably the best known of the neuro-
transmitters and the ones most frequently targeted by psychiatric medication. Allthree are classified as monoamines based on their chemical structure. Glutamate is a
general excitatory neurotransmitter—it increases the likelihood that neurons willfire. GABA is a general inhibitory neurotransmitter—it decreases the likelihood of
neurons firing. Histamine is known for
its involvement in the allergic response.Acetylcholine is involved with memory
and is targeted by anti-Alzheimer’s drugs.
What are the major classes of
psychiatric medications?
The table below lists the major classes ofpsychiatric medications, sample drugs ineach class, and the primary neurotrans-mitter systems targeted by each medica-tion class. Cognitive enhancers are a fairlynew class of drugs, developed to treatAlzheimer’s dementia.

What functions does dopamine serve?
The dopamine pathways serve many functions. There are, in fact, several dopaminer-
gic tracts. The nigro-striatal tracts originate in the substantia nigra in the midbrain
and project to the basal ganglia. These tracts are involved with motor control (control
of physical movements) and are the neurons damaged in Parkinson’s disease. Antipsy-chotic drugs can also cause problems with this system, resulting in abnormal move-ments. The second major dopaminergic tract is known as the mesolimbic pathway. It
originates in the ventral tegmental area (also in the midbrain) and projects to thenucleus accumbens and some areas of the limbic system. This tract is associated withthe reward system. The third major dopaminergic tract is the mesocortical tract. LikeHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 138How are neurotransmitter tracts like the New York City subway?
Many of the major neurotransmitters are distributed by single tracts of neu-
rons. The cell bodies of these neurons are located deep in the midbrain or
brain stem but their axons travel great distances across the limbic system and thecortex, branching off to form synapses with many other neurons along the way. Inthis way, a neurotransmitter tract acts somewhat like a subway, with the neuro-transmitters acting as passengers. In the same way that the No. 1 line in New YorkCity runs through City College, Columbia University, the theater district, and thefinancial district, each neurotransmitter tract runs through specific areas of thebrain that serve specific functions. If you blockaded the No.1 line running downBroadway, you would have reduced activity in the four districts mentioned above.Likewise, if you blockade dopamine activity in the nigra-striatal tract, you willhave reduced activity in the basal ganglia and subsequent problems with motorcoordination will arise. This is exactly what happens with Parkinson’s disease.BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR
139the mesolimbic tract, this originates in the ventral tegmental area. It projects to thecortex, with particularly rich connections in the frontal lobe. This pathway is associat-ed with psychotic symptoms and is targeted by many antipsychotic medications.
What is the reward system?
The reward system refers to a tract of dopamine-containing neurons that are centrally
involved in the experience of desire. The object of desire is not important. This is anall-purpose motivation machine that is active in drug craving (cocaine, methampheta-mine, alcohol, and cigarettes) and in gambling, eating, and sex. It may be active aswell in many other activities that elicit strong motivation and desire. The reward sys-tem is composed of the mesolimbic dopaminergic tracts, which reach from the ven-
tral tegmental area in the midbrain to the nucleus accumbens in the forebrain.
How is serotonin involved in mood and behavior?
Serotonin is an evolutionarily ancient neurotransmitter system and is found in ani-
mals as primitive as sea slugs. In humans, not surprisingly, it is involved with a verywide array of functions, ranging from the simplest to the most advanced. For example,serotonin is involved with hunger, sleep, migraine headaches, and sexual function. Itis also involved with mood, anxiety, and anticipation of harm. People with low levels ofserotonin demonstrate impulse control problems, while people with high levels ofserotonin manifest excessive levels of caution and inhibition. The serotonin tractsoriginate in the raphe nuclei in the brainstem and project widely throughout the cere-bral cortex. Certain serotonergic tracts also project downwards to the spinal cord.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 139140Serotonin is targeted by the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the
widely used class of antidepressants. Examples of SSRIs include fluoxetine (Prozac),
sertraline (Zoloft), and paroxetine (Paxil). SSRIs are also effective in the treatment ofanxiety disorders and obsessive compulsive disorder.
What ways does norepinephrine impact mental life?
Norepinephrine appears to be related to arousal and attention. When norepinephrine,
also known as noradrenaline, is released into the brain of an animal, the animalbecomes more alert and vigilant to its environment. Likewise, norepinephrine may beinvolved in attention deficit disorder (ADD). Norepinephrine also activates the auto-nomic nervous system during the fight/flight response, affecting activity in the cardio-vascular, muscular, and digestive systems. In fact, beta blockers, a class of medicationused to treat high blood pressure, act on the noradrenergic system, the tract of neu-rons that release norepinephrine. In addition, the noradrenergic system is targeted bya class of antidepressant medication known as tricyclics. This suggests that norepi-nephrine may also be involved in mood.
How are glutamate and GABA important?
These two neurotransmitters have broadly distributed effects; they are found through-out the brain. Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain; it acti-vates the nervous system and appears to be involved in learning and memory. Newresearch suggests it is also involved with schizophrenia. In contrast, GABA is aninhibitory neurotransmitter; it calms the nervous system. GABA neurotransmittersare targeted by the benzodiazepines, antianxiety medications that also act as tranquil-izers. Examples of benzodiazepines include clonazepam (Klonopin), lorazepam (Ati-van), diazepam (Valium), and alprazolam (Xanax). Because of their enjoyably relaxingeffect (as well as their addictive potential), these GABA-ergic medications are some-times used as drugs of abuse.
What are neuromodulators ?
Many of the brain chemicals known to influence psychological processes are not actuallyneurotransmitters. These alternative forms of brain chemicals are also known as neuro-modulators because they modulate the action of neurotransmitters. Such chemicals
may include neuropeptides or neurohormones. Examples include opioids, oxytocin, and
vasopressin, which are involved in pain processing and social behaviors, respectively.
What are opioids, the natural pain killers?
Opioids are a form of neuromodulator that serves to dampen our pain response. They
are our homemade analgesics, our natural painkillers. One way that opioids work is toHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 140How did scientific studies of voles
show the effects of oxytocin and vasopressin on behavior?
Aseries of studies comparing the
montane vole and the prairie
vole has given us important insightsinto the workings of oxytocin andvasopressin. Voles are small rodentsfound in several different habitats.The montane voles live in fairly iso-lated mountain burrows, while theprairie voles live in densely populat-ed colonies.
Consequently, the two types of
voles demonstrate very differentsocial behaviors. The prairie vole,but not the montane vole, displaysmonogamous mating patterns and agenerally high level of social behav-ior. Prairie voles also have higherlevels of oxytocin and vasopressin. Vasopressin has been directly linked to socialbehaviors displayed by the male prairie vole but not his montane cousin. Specifi-cally, male prairie voles display both partner preference and mate guarding. Thismeans that they prefer to sit by their mates over other animals and they showaggressive behavior towards any male who comes near their mate.
When vasopressin is blocked in the male prairie vole’s brain, the animal no
longer demonstrates partner preference or mate guarding, although sexual andaggressive behavior are otherwise intact. Likewise, when oxytocin is blocked in thefemale prairie vole’s brain, both partner preference and maternal behavior decline.
Studies of the humble vole have demonstrated how oxytocin
and vasopressin affect behavior.
inhibit the effect of the neurotransmitter glutamate. As glutamate is an excitatory
neurotransmitter, inhibiting glutamate serves to reduce brain activity, in effect tocalm down the brain.
How are opiates different from opioids?
Opiates are essentially the plant form of opioids. Opiates are extracted from the sap of
the opium poppy. Synthetic versions of this chemical are also called opiates. Wheningested, opiates bind to the opioid receptors in the human brain. Thus the brainresponds to opiates the same way that it responds to our own endogenous (internallyBRAIN AND BEHAVIOR
141Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 141created) opioids . Several very potent painkillers, such as morphine, heroin, and
opium, are made from opiates. Because of the relaxing and euphoric effects of opiates,
opiate-based medications are popular drugs of abuse.
What are the “love chemicals”?
Oxytocin and vasopressin are two neuropeptides that perform a wide range of impor-
tant functions. For example, vasopressin is involved with kidney function. However,they are best known within the field of psychology for their involvement in socialbehavior. Oxytocin has been linked to childbearing and lactation and both oxytocinand vasopressin have been linked to parenting behavior as well as to sexual orgasmand the emotional connection formed during sexual activity. A famous series of stud-ies on the social behavior of the vole (see Sidebar) suggests that these chemicals areless related to sexual behavior per se than to the formation of emotional bonds.
How do psychiatric drugs act on our brain chemicals?
The majority of psychiatric drugs act by altering one or more neurotransmitter sys-tems. Typically the medications do not contain the actual neurotransmitters butinstead contain various chemicals that regulate the action of neurotransmitters. Forexample, the SSRI antidepressants block the re-absorption of serotonin. This keepsthe serotonin molecules in the synapse longer, giving them more time to bind toreceptor sites and, therefore, stimulate the firing of the post-synaptic neuron. To visu-alize this process, imagine someone standing at your door, continuously pressing hisor her finger on your doorbell.
How do drugs of abuse act on the brain?
Drugs of abuse and legitimate medications act similarly on our brain. In fact, a num-ber of psychiatric medications are sometimes misused as drugs of abuse. Drugs ofabuse tend to cause quicker and more intense pleasurable effects than other drugs. Itis this “high” that makes these drugs attractive as recreational drugs.
How can drugs of abuse change the brain?
Because of the direct effect of illicit substances on neurotransmitter action, there isoften a dramatic alteration of neurotransmitter receptor activity. For example, inresponse to foreign chemicals that mimic the activity of neurotransmitters, the neu-rons may decrease their own neurotransmitter production or activity. Receptor sitesmay die off. This change of the actual structure of the neurons contributes to theaddictive process. When the brain makes less neurotransmitter or is less able toprocess it, craving sets in. Drug tolerance, the need for more and more of the same
142Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 142drug to achieve the same psychological effect, is likewise related to the changes in the
structure of the neuron.

IMPACT OF ENVIRONMENT
ON THE BRAIN
How does learning change the brain?
More and more research is revealing the powerful ways that learning and experience
shape the brain. While this is most true in childhood, the brain continues to be modifiedby experience throughout adulthood. Although genetics are crucially important in prena-tal brain development, much of postnatal brain development is dependent on learning. Infact, every time the brain fires, it is slightly altered. One way that memory takes place isthrough a process known as long-term potentiation. The neurons fire in a particular pat-
tern and the connections between the neurons involved are strengthened. Experience canchange the brain in other ways as well. The receptor sites at a synapse can increase ordecrease. New dendrites can branch out as can new axon terminals to form new synapseswith nearby neurons. In these varied ways, the brain is very plastic.
What does the plasticity of the brain say about the nature/nurture debate?
One of the oldest debates within psychology (dating back to Plato and Aristotle, atleast) involves the importance of nature vs. nurture with regard to human psychology.How much of who we are is innate and how much is learned, a product of our envi-ronment? In modern terms, this is a debate between genetics and learning. How muchis genetic and how much is learned? The growing body of evidence showing the plas-ticity of the brain, however, throws a wrench into this debate. If the brain is a functionof genetics—and few people would contest the importance of genetics in the develop-ment of the brain—then how do we understand the plasticity of the brain?
The brain is both genetically determined and shaped by lived experience. One way
to resolve this nature/nurture dilemma is to assume that genetics sets the outerboundaries of brain development. The basic structure of the brain is genetically deter-mined. Even if you bring a child up among horses, the child will not develop the brain
143BRAIN AND BEHAVIORHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 143144of a horse. However, the specific connections among neurons, the density of these
connections, and the neuronal connections that die off are in large part determined bylearning and environment.
How does the environment affect the brain in childhood?
An enormous amount of brain development takes place during childhood, particularlyearly childhood. Because of the central role of experience on brain development, thenature of environmental input in childhood is critical. Nutrition, education, verbalexposure, language, emotional, and interpersonal experience—all critically impact theformation of connections between neurons, the building of neural networks. This kindof environmental input affects which synaptic connections survive and which die off.In this way, early environment becomes hardwired into the child’s brain. With time,these early environmental influences become increasingly difficult and sometimeseven impossible to change.
How does nutrition affect the brain?
The brain essentially quadruples in weight from birth to adulthood. Although there isa peak period of synaptogenesis (creation of new synapses) in the first two years of life,synaptogenesis continues rapidly throughout a child’s first decade. All this growthtakes fuel. Just as the spurt in the body’s growth during adolescence takes fuel (andmost parents can attest to the enormous amount of food their adolescent sons take

in), brain growth also takes fuel. Therefore, if there is inadequate nutrition, brain
growth in childhood will be hampered. Moreover, when children are hungry, theirconcentration is impacted and their ability to learn in school or in any other environ-ment will suffer accordingly. Although it seems to make intuitive sense that the quali-ty of food will also affect brain development during childhood, the research is lessrobust on the effect of specific diets on learning.
How does language exposure affect brain development?
The human brain is uniquely designed to learn and process language. This differenti-ates us from every other animal on earth. Children are born with the capacity to rec-ognize sounds made in any language. With exposure to their native language, howev-er, the neural circuits associated with sounds from their own language will bestrengthened and those associated with the sounds of other languages will atrophy. Inthis way, children become hardwired to speak and understand their native language.Children can learn other languages, of course, but second languages are processedsomewhat differently than are native languages. Moreover, as children grow older, itbecomes more difficult to learn new languages.
How does psychological trauma affect the brain?
There is now considerable evidence that severe psychological trauma, and particularlychildhood trauma, has long-lasting impact on the brain. Since the time of Freud, psy-chotherapists have been aware of the severe and persistent psychological damagecaused by traumatic experiences, but neuroscience is now catching up with the clini-cians. Trauma triggers the body’s stress response, mediated through the HPA axis.Over-activation of the HPA axis, as can occur with chronic trauma such as child abuse,dulls its flexibility, sort of like a rubber band that has been stretched out of shape.How did Eric Kandel demonstrate that learning

The photograph (on the opposite page) is of a species of sea slug similar to theone that won Eric Kandel the Nobel Prize in 2000. Kandel’s great contribu-
tion was to demonstrate in an animal with a very simple nervous system howlearning changes the brain. By altering the way he touched the tail of the seaslug, Kandel trained the animal to either amplify or minimize a protective reflex.When he examined the sea slug’s nervous system, he found that the neurons’synapses had been changed as a result of the conditioning.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 145This results in people with either overactive or underactive stress responses. Frequent-
ly, they have both. When the stress response is underactive, people can be somewhat dissoci-
ated, as if they are not processing what is going on around them. When the stress responseis overactive, people will be hyper-reactive to any possible threat. Another set of studies hassuggested that there is a reduced volume in the hippocampus in people with trauma histo-ries. This may relate to the distortions of memory that often accompanies trauma.
How does interpersonal experience affect brain development in childhood ?
Psychologists have long understood the importance of early interpersonal relation-ships in child development. Several different branches of psychology—including psy-choanalysis, attachment theory, and even cognitive therapy—explain personalitydevelopment in terms of the profound impact of early interpersonal experience. Whileour understanding of the neurobiology behind these observations is relatively young,we are slowly gaining a richer understanding of how these potent early experiencesshape the brain. For one, there is suggestion that representations of early childhoodrelationships are processed in the superior medial pre-frontal cortex.
Once these representations have been encoded, it is hard to change them. In this
way, our view of relationships become somewhat hardwired. It has also been suggestedthat the emotional tone of early childhood experiences is preserved in the underlyingneural circuitry. More specifically, neural circuits underlying positive emotions arestrengthened or weakened depending on the degree of positive emotion experiencedin childhood. Further, the circuits related to the stress response, particularly the HPAaxis, are strongly influenced by the degree of stress experienced during childhood.Over time, this affects the flexibility and resilience of the body’s stress response. We allknow people who are entirely overwhelmed by stress. Their stress reactions are easilytriggered and they can only calm down with difficulty. In some cases, this might bethe result of abnormal levels of stress during childhood.

DEVELOPMENTACROSS THE LIFESPANHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 147What are the major theories of child development and why are
they important?
There are several theories in psychology that cover different aspects of child develop-
ment. For example, Sigmund Freud developed a theory of the psychosexual stages ofchildhood, Erik Erikson translated Freud’s psychosexual stages into a theory of emo-tional and social development, and Jean Piaget wrote about intellectual development.
Are there theories of adult development ?
While the theories of child development are better known, there are also several theo-ries of how adults change across the lifespan. Erik Erikson’s psychosocial stagesextend across the entire lifespan. Daniel Levinson and Roger Gould have also writtenabout adult development.
FREUD’S PSYCHOSEXUAL STAGES
What are Freud’s psychosexual stages?
We will start with Sigmund’s Freud’s theory of psychosexual stages as it is the oldestand best known developmental stage theory. Moreover, it influenced later theories, par-ticularly Erikson’s. Freud proposed five psychosexual stages: oral, anal, phallic, latency,and genital. Freud’s general theory of psychology (often referred to as his metapsychol-
ogy) is difficult to understand in modern terms. He wrote in the late nineteenth andearly twentieth century and framed his concepts in the physical science of the day. Itwas very important to him that his work was seen as having scientific merit.
From a modern vantage point, however, some of his theories seem like he was try-
ing to fit a square peg into a round hole. Each stage of Freud’s theory refers to a partof the body known as an erogenous zone. This refers to the area of the body wherelibido (loosely translated as sensual pleasure) is most powerfully concentrated. Per-sonality traits accompany each erogenous zone. For example, the anal stage is associ-ated with either a rigid need for order or a messy lack of self-discipline. Later theoristsinterpreted his psychosexual stages less literally, seeing his ideas in more metaphori-cal terms. Erikson translated these ideas into social constructs.
What did Freud mean by the oral stage?
The oral stage occurs during the first eighteen months of life. During this time thechild’s primary erogenous zone is in the mouth. The personality traits associated withthis stage include dependency and a kind of oceanic and all-encompassing emotionalexperience. When emotions are felt, they seem to take over the whole world. If we lookat babies of this age, we can see why Freud called it the oral stage. For one thing,
148Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 148nursing is a central part of their life. Moreover, as any parent can tell you, babies love
to put things in their mouth. Additionally, we expect dependency from children at thisage. As they are incapable of surviving on their own, they have intense and continuousneed of parental attention.
What did Freud mean by the anal stage?
The anal stage takes place from age eighteen months to approximately three years. Atthis point the child’s erogenous zone transfers from the mouth to the anus. This is atime of toilet training, when the child is expected to exercise control over his or herfeces. The quality of parental discipline during this process can influence the child’sdevelopment through this stage. If the parent is too strict, the child might becomeanal retentive, focused too much on controlling and holding in feces. In personalityterms, this translates to an overemphasis on control, self-discipline, neatness, andstinginess with regard to money. If the parents are insufficiently strict around toilettraining, the child can become anal-explosive, inadequately focused on controllingfeces. The associated personality traits include messiness and a lack of self-discipline.
What did Freud mean by the phallic stage?
The phallic stage takes place from around three to around six years of age. Freud believedthis to be a critical phase in the development of neurosis, which he understood to reflect

Freud’s notion of the oral stage ( iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 149a conflict between instinctual urges and societal restraints. In this phase, the erogenous
stage moves from the anus to the phallus (or the penis). This is the first psychosexualstage in which gender becomes an important factor. The fact that half the populationdoes not have a phallus evidently did not deter Freud from naming this phase after anexclusively male body part. The personality traits associated with this phase include ini-tiative and aggressiveness, which is associated with the intrusive action of the penis dur-ing intercourse. If parents react to this stage with excessive punitiveness, the child willbe overcome with guilt and suppress his or her own initiative and ambition.
How does the Oedipal complex influence the development of the
phallic stage?
Freud put a lot of emphasis on the Oedipal complex , which he believed to be a univer-
sal drama that children undergo during the phallic stage. The Oedipal complex is bestunderstood in boys, though Freud also proposed an Electra complex for girls. Both
complexes are named after characters in classical Greek plays. Oedipus was the Greekprince who unwittingly killed his father and married his mother. When he realized
what he had done, he gouged out his owneyes in remorse. In little boys, the phallicstage brings an increased interest in theirown genitals. Along with this, they startto become interested in their mothers asromantic partners. Recognizing theirfathers as rivals for their mother’s exclu-sive attention, they fantasize about get-ting rid of their fathers, even of killingthem. However, they also love theirfathers, so the tension between feelings oflove and hate cause them much conflictand guilt. They project their guilt feelingsonto their fathers and fear that theirmuch larger and more powerful fatherswill retaliate against them by cutting offtheir now highly valued penis. This fear isknown as castration anxiety.
As a means of resolving their conflict,
they identify with their fathers, aiming tobecome just like their big and strongfathers when they grow up. They alsointernalize the moral code of their father.This newfound respect for authorityreflects the development of the superego,
150
Freud based many of his ideas on themes from ancient Greek
literature. This picture shows a bust of Sophocles, the famousGreek dramatist who wrote plays about Oedipus and Electra.Sophocles lived in the fifth century 
B.C.E.(iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 150the part of the mind that adopts parental rules as the basis of a moral code. Freud
attributed many aspects of adult personality to the successful resolution of the Oedipalcomplex. These include capacity for ambition, aspiration, guilt, and morality.
How did Freud account for girls’ Oedipal complexes?
Freud had a hard time accounting for girls’ Oedipal complexes. Because he tied psy-chological processes so tightly to specific body parts, he ran into trouble when hefocused too narrowly on the penis. How can a girl have an Oedipal complex if she hasno penis to be castrated? His solution was the Electra complex, named for a characterin a Greek tragedy who conspired with her brother to kill their mother in order toavenge the murder of their father. In Freud’s view, the little girl realizes that hermother does not have a penis. She loses respect for her mother and turns to herfather, whom she now values more than her mother. She is tormented with penis envy
herself and blames her mother for her own lack of a penis. She resolves this dilemmaby identifying with her mother’s childbearing abilities. She realizes that she will growup to have a baby just like her mother and accepts that as consolation for her lack of apenis. Freud infamously concluded that because girls cannot be influenced by castra-tion anxiety, they were likely to have weaker superegos than boys.
What does the latency stage refer to?
After the drama of the phallic stage, the child goes into a period of relative calm. Thiscovers the period from about age six to puberty. The sexual or libidinal impulses gounderground at this stage; they lie latent. Instead, libidinal energy is translated into
nonsexual pursuits, such as school, peer relationships, games, etc. Libido does notrise up again until puberty.
What did Freud mean by the genital stage?
The genital stage begins at puberty, in the early teens. At this stage the genitalsbecome the primary erogenous zone. Of note in this stage, Freud does not restrict hisfocus to male genitals only. The earlier erogenous zones do not disappear, however;instead they are integrated into fully mature genital sexuality. Oral and anal pleasureremain but they are subordinate to genital pleasure. Successful entrance into thisstage allows the person to attain pleasure through sexual intercourse. The personalitytraits that have been associated with genital sexuality include the capacity for mature,reciprocal, and intimate relationships—the capacity for give and take.
How are Freud’s psychosexual stages understood today?
Much has changed in psychoanalytic circles since Freud’s day. In general, Freudessentially equated particular personality traits with specific body parts. Even though
Freud’s erogenous zones do play important roles in childhood (the mouth in infancy,
151PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPANHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 151toilet training during the toddler years, and genitals in adolescence), the psychologi-
cal tasks of child development cannot be reduced to parts of the body. Moreover,although sensual and sexual pleasure does play some role in childhood, there are fewpsychologists today who would put sexual pleasure at the heart of childhood develop-ment as Freud did.
ERIK ERIKSON’S PSYCHOSOCIAL STAGES
What were Erik Erikson’s psychosocial stages?
Erik Erikson (1902–1994) was a psychoanalyst who translated Freud’s psychosexualstages into his own set of psychosocial stages . He also extended his stages into adult-
hood. In effect, he interpreted Freud’s emphasis on sexual body parts as a metaphorfor emotional and interpersonal processes. His eight psychosocial stages include:Trust vs. Mistrust, Autonomy vs. Shame and Doubt, Initiative vs. Guilt, Industry vs.Inferiority, Identity Development vs. Role Confusion, Intimacy vs. Isolation, Genera-tivity vs. Stagnation, and Integrity vs. Despair. The first four stages take place in child-hood while the last three stages cover adulthood.
What is the Trust vs. Mistrust stage?
The first four stages cover childhood and parallel Freud’s psychosexual stages. Trustvs. Mistrust parallels Freud’s oral stage and takes place during the first year and a half
of life. This is when the child’s fundamental sense of the safety and benevolence of theworld is formed. If the child is well cared for and his or her needs are met, the childwill experience the world as a generally safe and positive place. If the child does notreceive this basic level of care, it sets the stage for a general experience of mistrust;the world will be seen as cold and dangerous. This fundamental world view forms thefoundation of all later psychological development.
What is involved with the stage of Autonomy vs. Shame and Doubt?
The stage of Autonomy vs. Shame and Doubt parallels Freud’s anal stage and takesplace from about age 18 months to about age three. During this period there is newdemand for self-control and for control of bodily functions. The process of toilet train-ing is an important example of this. With these new demands, for the first time thechild is exposed to the possibility of shame. Additionally, it is a time of greater inde-pendence, when the child demands greater autonomy. Depending on the parents’responses to the child’s behavior, the child either develops a rudimentary sense ofautonomy or becomes excessively constrained by shame and doubt.
152Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 152What happens during the Initiative vs. Guilt stage?
The next stage, Initiative vs. Guilt, parallels Freud’s phallic stage and takes the Oedipal
complex into account. This stage takes place during the pre-school years, from aboutage three to age six. At this stage, the child has developed the capacity for initiative, toset goals and intentionally pursue them. However, the child also becomes aware thatnot all goals are socially acceptable, marking the beginning of moral development.The child’s sense of right and wrong depends on a simplistic and black-and-whiteunderstanding of parental rules and prohibitions. Depending on parental reactions tothis stage, the child will develop confidence in his or her own initiative, or becomeoverwhelmed and stifled by guilt.
What did Erikson mean by Industry vs. Inferiority?
This stage parallels Freud’s latency stage and takes place during middle childhood, fromabout age six to about age twelve. As Freud noted, children of this age are less emotion-ally tumultuous. This is a relatively calm time in a child’s development, where the basicskills of self-regulation and interpersonal behavior have been mastered. This is a time forthe child to learn how to participate in the wider world. In industrialized countries thismainly involves school-based education. When children feel successful in these endeav-ors, they develop confidence in their own industry, in their capacity to work. If they can-not master the tasks expected of them at this stage, they feel inferior and incapable.
What is involved with Identity vs. Role Confusion?
This stage takes place in adolescence. It is the first psychosocial stage to extendbeyond childhood. One of Erikson’s particular interests was the concept of ego identi-ty. He was interested in the manner in which people develop a concept of themselveswithin their social world. In late adolescence, people are expected to leave the shelterof their family and start to take their place within the larger society, to take on anadult role in society. Part of this process involves the development of an identity. Whatkind of adult will I be? What kind of career will I have? What are my values? Mybeliefs? While it is important that adolescents not shut down this search too soon,thus imprisoning themselves into an overly rigid identity, they also need to narrowtheir options enough to choose an adult path. People who have trouble with thisprocess struggle with a diffuse and confused sense of their role in society.
What does Erikson mean by Intimacy vs. Isolation?
Another of the challenges of early adulthood involves the capacity for romantic inti-macy. Erikson believed that it was necessary to consolidate a personal identity beforecommitting to a life partnership. We need to have a sufficiently solid sense of selfbefore we can endanger it by merging our lives with another person. If the young
153PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPANHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 153adult cannot manage the task of intimacy, the cost is isolation. While Erikson mainly
focused on heterosexual love and marriage, he also included the capacity to commit toa social group in his notion of intimacy. It is important to consider, however, thatErikson published his theory of psychosocial stages in 1950, when most people mar-ried and had families in their early twenties. The average age of marriage in the UnitedStates has increased significantly since then, as has the percentage of people whoremain single or choose not to have children. Thus while Erikson’s theories are stillwell regarded, they must be considered within the context of the culture.
What does Generativity vs. Stagnation refer to?
This stage takes place in mid-life. By this point, people have generally established asolid sense of self, a clear role in society, and a stable romantic partnership. Up untilthis point, people focus on themselves and on establishing their own adult lives. How-ever, in this new stage, the adult turns his or her attention to the next generation, tohelping other people establish their lives. This new need for generativity can be met
through parenting, through mentorship of younger people in the workplace, orthrough other forms of contributing to one’s community. The opposite of generativityis stagnation, a feeling of being stuck in a rut.
What does Erikson mean by Integrity vs. Despair ?
This stage occurs in late life. At this point the adult is facing the end of life. In otherwords, the adult is facing the reality of his or her own death. Life is not infinite, it hasan end and the end is getting closer. This is a time of reflection, a time to review one’swhole life. Has it been what you expected? Were there things you were disappointedabout? What was meaningful? If people can come to terms with their own life as lived,they can begin to accept the reality of death. They can reach a sense of integrity, ofwholeness. If they cannot accept the reality of their life, if they are plagued by a senseof unfinished business or of disappointment, they can only face death with despair.
MARGARET MAHLER
Who was Margaret Mahler?
Margaret Mahler (1897–1985) was a Hungarian-born psychoanalyst who immigratedto the United States in 1938. In 1975, she published a book with Anni Bergman andFred Pine called the Psychological Birth of the Human Infant . This book was very
influential in psychoanalytic circles because of its use of the direct observation of chil-dren. In other words, Mahler applied the scientific method to clinical theory, some-thing few psychoanalytic theorists had bothered to do previously. Mahler was roughly
154Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 154contemporary with John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth, the founders of attachment the-
ory, who were also pioneers in this domain.
What is Margaret Mahler’s theory of separation-individuation?
Like many psychoanalysts of her time, Mahler believed that the foundation of adultpersonality was created in the childhood relationship with the mother. Mahler wasfocused on independence, how the child grows from an entirely dependent being toone who is relatively independent, both physically and psychologically. She called thisdevelopmental process separation-individuation . Mahler was most interested in the
child’s growing ability to recognize both the self and the mother as independent andseparate beings. It is the child’s developing capacity to represent (or conceptualize)
the mother that allows independence from the mother. When children can thinkabout their mother when she is not there, they can comfort themselves with thememory of her presence. In Mahler’s terms, the child has internalized the mother.
How did Mahler differ from previous psychoanalytic stage theorists?
Prior to people like Margaret Mahler and John Bowlby, psychoanalysis had largelyrelied on the process of reconstruction to understand child development. In otherwords, ideas of child development were based on observations of adult patients. Inorder to understand the problems of their adult patients, Freud and his followers
155PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPAN
Placing babies in a room with toys and their mothers, Margaret Mahler studied how young children go through the separation-
individuation process (iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 155reconstructed the childhoods of their patients. The most severe psychopathology was
assumed to reflect regression to the earliest stage of childhood. Less severe psy-
chopathology was assumed to reflect regression to later stages in childhood (like theOedipal complex). There was very little direct observation of actual children. AlthoughMahler grounded her ideas in accepted psychoanalytic theory, she added the actualobservation of real children. It is perhaps no surprise, then, that the parts of her theo-ry that are based on real observation have had the most staying power, while the partsderived from purely theoretical assumptions have been much less influential.
How did Mahler study infant behavior?
Mahler wanted to observe the real-time interaction of mothers and babies during thefirst three years of life. She set up a laboratory, which eventually expanded to severaladjacent rooms. There were areas with chairs for the mothers to sit comfortably.There were also rooms full of toys. This gave the babies the choice either to be close totheir mothers or to separate from them in order to explore the rooms full of toys. Thesystematic observation of mothers and babies began when the babies were about fouror five months old. Mahler assumed that the separation-individuation process did notstart until this age.
What are the stages, or sub-phases, of separation-individuation?
Mahler proposed five overall phases of separation-individuation. The first two stages,which extend from birth to four to five months, are considered forerunners of theactual process of separation-individuation. The next three stages are termed sub-phas-es of the separation-individuation phase proper. Differentiation starts at four to five
months and continues until about ten months. Practicing ranges from about ten
months until sixteen to eighteen months. Rapprochement ranges from about eigh-
teen months to about two years. After the child comes out of rapprochement, the childis in the beginnings of emotional object constancy , the final subphase of the separa-
tion-individuation phase, which extends from two years to about three years.
What are the forerunners of the separation-individuation phase?
As Mahler observed relatively few babies before the age of four to five months, her the-ory of the first two stages was based less on actual observation than on prior psycho-analytic theory. Her ideas about these two stages are heavily indebted to assumptions
about infancy drawn from work with emotionally disturbed children and adults. Thefirst phase is called the normal autistic phase and takes place from birth to two
months. At this period the child is thought to be uninterested in the outer world; thechild is withdrawn, only attending to inner bodily experiences. In the symbiotic phase,the baby’s attention has moved out beyond the sensations of his or her own body toinclude a newfound interest in the mother. This is a time of tactile exploration of the
156Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 156mother, of molding to her body when held, and of direct eye contact. However, Mahler
believed that symbiotic children do not recognize the distinction between their moth-er and themselves. They do not differentiate their mother from themselves and so live
with an illusion of blissful fusion.
What is the egg metaphor?
Mahler liked to use the image of the egg to describe the child’s development duringthese first two stages. In the normal autistic phase, children live as if inside their ownegg. The eggshell is a barrier between the baby and the outside world. In the symbioticphase, the egg extends to include the mother as well as the baby. The child’s entireworld includes only the mother and the self.
What did Mahler mean by hatching?
Drawing from the egg metaphor, Mahler used the term “hatching”, to describe thebaby’s emergence out of what Mahler believed to be the self-absorption of earliestinfancy. Around five months, the child starts to show increased awareness and interestin the surrounding world. It is as if the child is hatching out of the shell, finally enter-ing the world psychologically as well as physically.
What is the differentiation sub-phase?
This is the first sub-phase of the separation-individuation process proper. It startsaround four to five months and extends to about ten months. This is also the first ofMahler’s stages that was fully based on direct observation of infants. The term hatching
was applied to this stage. The child is showing increased interest in the outer world andis beginning the critical process of recognizing the separateness of the mother. This isalso the beginning of physically moving away from the mother; the baby slides out of themother’s lap or crawls away from her. The psychological separation parallels the physicalone. A number of behaviors demonstrate the child’s growing awareness of the mother’sidentity as a separate person. One particularly charming behavior, which Mahler termed“custom’s inspection”, involves the child’s purposeful investigation of the mother’s faceor even that of a stranger. The baby grabs at various parts of the adult’s face, figuring outwhat does and does not belong to that person’s body. The glasses, for example, come offwhile the lips do not. The child can also compare the features of the mother’s face tothat of the stranger. Stranger anxiety and separation anxiety also occur during thisphase, both of which signal a new awareness of the separateness of the mother.
What is the practicing sub-phase?
This is the second observed phase and extends from about age ten months until sixteento eighteen months. This is the period where children’s locomotor abilities, or their
157PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPANHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 157capacity to move about on their own, take
a giant developmental leap. Around eightmonths, a baby begins to crawl. By aboutten months, children are frequentlypulling themselves up by grabbing ontofurniture and, at least temporarily, theyare able to stand on their own. By abouttwelve months, the child is starting towalk. This dramatic motor developmenthastens the physical aspect of the separa-
tion-individuation phase. More and more,
babies can now get about on their own.
What is the child’s love affair with
the world ?
In the early practicing sub-phase, Mahlerdescribes the child’s “love affair with theworld.” The child appears to be simplydelighted with the newfound power andfreedom. Separation anxiety decreases asdoes sensitivity to minor knocks and falls.Frequently, we can see children of thisage running gleefully away from their
parents, as if on top of the world. Often they are running toward the street, with a hor-rified parent close behind. To children of this age, the world is their oyster. Dangerdoes not exist. In fact, the greatest frustration comes from confinement. We have allwitnessed this with joyful toddlers running around the supermarket, only to explodein screams when forced into their stroller.
What is the rapprochement subphase ?
This period ranges from about eighteen months until about two years. AlthoughMahler locates this period prior to age two, parents might recognize this period as theTerrible Twos. In Mahler’s view, the child has recovered from the elation of the practic-ing period to recognize the terrible dilemma of independence. Just as they can sepa-rate from their mothers, their mothers can separate from them. Mother is not anextension of the child’s will, but a separate person who is not under the omnipotentcontrol of the child. It is as if children realize that they are only three feet high—verysmall people in a very large world.
The child is caught in a conflict between the fierce desire for greater indepen-
dence and the inevitable distress of recognizing the limits of one’s control over the
158
A toddler often experiences sheer joy over mastering the
ability to walk ( iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 158world. This same conflict is encountered
again in adolescence and the resultingbehaviors are fairly similar. Mahlerdescribes great ambivalence in childrenin the rapprochement stage. A child willbe very clingy toward the mother andthen suddenly push her away. This is alsothe time of temper tantrums and of insis-tent self-assertion. The child discoversthe word “No!” Certainly we have allheard toddlers of this age, shouting “No!No! No!” to any request or demand.
What are the beginnings of
emotional object constancy ?
After the child resolves the conflicts of the
rapprochement stage, the child enters thesub-phase of the beginnings of emotionalobject constancy. In this sub-phase, thechild consolidates a representation of themother, in which the mother can have both good and bad features at the same time.Children can feel both anger and love toward their mother without fearing the loss oftheir relationship. Even when they are angry at their mother, children can rememberthat they still love and need her. This integration of positive and negative features sup-ports the child’s internalization of the mother, an achievement that gives children
much greater control over their emotions and their behavior. As the positive memoryof the mother can now withstand the storm of the child’s negative feelings, the child isless afraid of the loss of the relationship. The child is at the beginnings of emotional
object constancy as the capacity to keep both positive and negative feelings towardsomeone in mind is a skill that is far from mature at two years of age. In fact, this hall-mark of psychological maturity remains a challenge throughout the lifespan.
JEAN PIAGET’S THEORY
OF COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT
What is Jean Piaget’s theory of cognitive development?
Jean Piaget (1896–1980) was a Swiss psychologist who produced an extremelyinfluential body of work on the intellectual development of children. Unlike Freud
159PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPAN
Temper tantrums are a hallmark of the toddler years.
Although infants can certainly get very upset, they do notthrow temper tantrums per se. While frustrating for theparent, the onset of temper tantrums is actually a sign ofcognitive development. The child has become aware that heor she has a will and that this will is being thwarted ( iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 159and Erikson, who developed comprehensive theories about personality develop-
ment in children, Piaget had a more narrow focus. He was exclusively interested inthe child’s intellectual development. He wanted to understand the ways that chil-
dren learn to understand their environment. It was Piaget’s brilliant insight to rec-ognize that children do not only differ from adults in the content of their knowl-
edge; they also differ in the structure of their knowledge. They not only know less,
they know differently.
Piaget proposed four stages of intellectual (or cognitive) development: sensory-
motor, pre-operational, concrete operational, and formal operational. Although Piagetfailed to consider the important roles of culture, language, or environment on cogni-tive development, his basic ideas maintain their tremendous importance and influ-ence, particularly in the field of educational psychology.
What did Piaget mean by the sensory-motor stage?
The sensory-motor stage covers the first two years of life. It is roughly parallel withFreud’s oral stage and Erikson’s trust vs. mistrust stage. In this stage, the child onlyknows the world through direct physical contact. In other words, the child only knowsthe world through sensory experience (e.g., touch or sight) or motor action (e.g., kick-
ing or grasping).
What does object permanence mean?
An important feature of the sensory-motor stage is the baby’s inability to symbolize. Inother words, the child cannot hold an image of an object in his or her mind when it isno longer physically present. When the object is “out of sight,” it is “out of mind.”Piaget’s concept of object permanence illustrates this phenomenon. If you dangle an
object in front of a young baby and then remove the object, the child will not searchfor the object when it is hidden from view. The child’s attention will simply drift to thenext interesting event. However, after the age of eight months (give or take), the babywill search for an interesting object hidden from view. If you hide the rattle behind apillow, the child will move the pillow to look for the rattle.
What role does language play in the pre-operational stage?
Piaget thought that the development of language was a milestone in cognitive devel-opment. Language, or what he called the semiotic function , frees the child from the
prison of the here and now. Not only can children think about things that are notimmediately present, but they can also communicate about them to other people. Thesemiotic function shepherds the child out of the sensory-motor stage and into the pre-operational stage.
160Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 160What did Piaget mean by the pre-operational stage?
The pre-operational stage takes place between the ages of two and seven. In this
phase, the child has learned to symbolize. That is, the child can think about an event
when it is not immediately happening. The child can represent the event mentally andis no longer dependent on immediate physical contact for knowledge of the world.This is an enormous step forward and frees the child’s intelligence from the con-straints of time and space. Nonetheless, the child’s comprehension of space and timeis still very immature. As we can imagine, the way a three-year-old understands therules of nature is very different from that of an adult.
What does Piaget mean by an operation?
Piaget uses the term operation to refer to the ability to act upon an object in one’s
mind. Piaget believed that knowledge came from action. The child acts upon the worldand therefore learns via direct experience how the world functions. When Piaget spokeabout operations, he meant that the child was able to perform mental actions on the
world, or on objects within the world.
Why are children between twoand seven years in the pre-operational stage?
In the pre-operational stage, children can manipulate objects in their mind, but theycannot yet perform a complete operation. There are several aspects to this. For one, chil-dren cannot perform reversible operations. They cannot understand that an object can
change shape and then change back again. Examples of this ability include the conserva-tion of volume and conservation of substance. Secondly, children of this age cannotdecenter. This means they cannot pay attention to more than one feature of the object ata time. They can pay attention to height or to width but not to height and width at thesame time. Because of this, they cannot understand how a tall and thin object can havethe same volume as a short and fat object. The taller object must be bigger. We see thiswhen small children insist that a taller person must be older than a shorter one.
What did Piaget mean by conservation of volume and conservation
of substance?
Piaget performed several experiments to study how children develop the concepts ofconservation of volume and substance. In one experiment, he poured a specificamount of liquid into a tall beaker. Then he poured the same amount of liquid into ashort and fat beaker. He asked the child which beaker had more liquid. Children in thepre-operational stage would insist that the tall and thin beaker had more liquid,although an older child could understand that both beakers have the same amount ofliquid. In another experiment, the child is presented with two round balls of clay ofthe same size. In front of the child’s eyes, one ball of clay is rolled into a long, thin
161PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPANHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 161shape. When asked which is bigger, pre-
operational children pointed to the long,thin one, even after witnessing it beingformed out of the original round ball.These children could not conserve thevolume or mass of the object as it wastransformed. Piaget performed similarexperiments to study conservation ofnumber, quantity, and weight.
What about the concrete
operational stage?
The concrete operational stage takes
place from about age seven to about ageeleven. It is concurrent with Freud’slatency age and Erikson’s industry vs.inferiority stage. By this stage, childrenhave mastered the basic rules of the phys-ical world. They understand the laws ofspace and time. This stage is marked bythe conservation of volume, substance,
number, and other physical features.Likewise, this stage is marked by thecapacity for decentration. In other words,
the child no longer gets hooked on onlyone feature of a situation. The child can
coordinate several features of an object, such as height and width, into a more com-prehensive understanding of how objects change and how they stay the same.
What are the societal implications for a child in the concrete
operational stage?
As Piaget pointed out, by the time a child has reached the age of seven, he or she hasmastered the fundamental rules of the physical world. This does not mean that chil-dren are now ready to leave their parents and live independently, but that they areready to learn the basic skills necessary to function in their society. In the contempo-rary Western world, this means learning academic skills in school. In some tribal soci-eties, boys of this age move out of their mother’s huts into the long house where themen and older boys stay. In medieval Europe, boys began their apprenticeships at ageseven. Thus, it is no coincidence that Erikson referred to this period as the stage ofIndustry vs. Inferiority. Now that the child has grasped the basic rules of physical real-ity, he or she must learn the rudimentary rules of work.

The formal operational stage begins around the age of 12. This is the beginning of
adolescence, a time of tremendous change in all areas of development. As Piagetpoints out, among the many changes associated with adolescence, there are signifi-cant cognitive changes as well. Primarily, the adolescent can effectively reason aboutthe possible. While children in the concrete operational stage can reason about actual
physical events, they are less effective when reasoning about potential or hypotheticalevents. In this way, concrete operational children are more restricted to the present orto the concrete.
What is hypothetico-deductive reasoning?
When asked to solve a problem, the adolescent can imagine many possible solutions tothe problem. These imagined solutions are called hypotheses. Adolescents can thenplan ways to test each of those hypotheses. This kind of reasoning from the hypotheti-cal is known as hypothetico-deductive reasoning and is the same kind of reasoning
used in scientific experiments. This newfound ability allows adolescents to use system-atic planning when solving problems. In contrast, children in the concrete operationalstage are more likely to problem solve through trial and error. They reason from theactual, not the hypothetical.
How do Piaget’s theories accord with what we know about
brain development ?
Although Piaget’s writings preceded our current discoveries about the brain, hisobservations about cognitive development are strongly supported by contemporaryneuroscience. The intellectual skills that Piaget studied are mediated by the prefrontalcortex, the area of the brain involved with complex cognitive processes. The frontallobe is the last area of the brain to develop in childhood and much of its developmenttakes place within the first decade of life. In fact, there is a peak period of synaptogene-sis (creation of synapses, the connections between brain cells) in the first two years oflife—during Piaget’s sensory-motor stage. Synaptogenesis continues at a rapid pacethroughout the first decade of life, bringing us up to the doorstep of the formal opera-tional stage. Myellination of the frontal lobe, or the insulation of brain cells by a fattysheath that speeds up nerve impulses, is not completed until the mid-twenties, howev-er, suggesting that cognitive development is far from complete in the teenage years.
What are the social implications of reaching the stage of formal operations?
Because of the adolescents’ increased ability for abstract thought—that is, their ability toreason about the possible and the hypothetical instead of just the actual—they becomecapable of much greater independence than they were at younger ages. Adolescents can
163PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPANHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 163plan, consider possible outcomes of their actions, consider alternative solutions to prob-
lems, and otherwise negotiate their way in the world far more effectively than youngerchildren can. They can also understand abstract concepts like religious or political beliefsystems in ways that younger children simply cannot appreciate. It is no coincidence thatpeople first become aware of and interested in political movements in adolescence. Whilechildren may parrot their parents’ political beliefs, they cannot truly reason out their ownbeliefs until they attain some degree of formal operational thought.
What roles do environment and education play in the attainment of
formal operations?
Although Piaget downplayed the role of environment in cognitive development, muchresearch has shown that adults vary considerably in their demonstration of the cogni-tive skills associated with formal operational thought. Piaget based his studies on ado-lescents in prestigious schools that specifically taught the skills of the scientificmethod. Thus, it is not surprising that adolescents and adults without the same edu-cational advantages would not perform as well in the tests of basic physics that Piagetused to measure formal operational thought. However, there is evidence that adoles-cents and adults can show hypothetico-deductive reasoning in areas that are relevantto their day-to-day lives. For example, Kalahari bushmen show hypothetico-deductivereasoning when analyzing animal tracks. Thus the concept of formal operations
appears to be valid, but the tests that measure it need to have ecological validity, that
is they need to be appropriate to the situation at hand.
KOHLBERG’S STAGES
OF MORAL DEVELOPMENT
Who was Lawrence Kohlberg?
Kohlberg (1927–1987) was a pioneer in the field of moral development. Influenced byPiaget, he developed a large body of research investigating moral reasoning. LikePiaget, he was interested in the way that children reason, and how this changes acrossdevelopment. In fact, Piaget himself had studied the moral development of children,but in a fairly limited way. It was left to Kohlberg to create the more elaborate theoryfor which he is now known.
What methods did Kohlberg use to study moral development ?
Kohlberg relied on a method of vignettes. He wrote up scenarios that involved a moraldilemma and presented them to his research subjects. He asked people what theywould do in each situation and then asked them to explain the reasoning behind their
164Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 164decision. He was much more interested in the way that people reasoned about their
moral choices than in their actual conclusions. Like Piaget, he was more interested inthe thought process than the content. Kohlberg’s best known vignette involves a mannamed Heinz who broke into a pharmacy to steal a drug in order to save his wife’s life.(See Sidebar).
What are Kohlberg’s stages of moral development ?
Kohlberg divided moral development into three levels: preconventional, conventional ,
and postconventional. Each level contains two stages for a total of six stages altogeth-
er. Kohlberg believed that all children go through the same sequence of stages in thesame order. A fair amount of research supports this view for the first two levels ofmoral development. The scientific evidence for the third level, however, is less robust.Kohlberg was also interested in moral reasoning in adults. Indeed, research has shownthat different adults are characterized by different stages of moral development.
What did Kohlberg mean by preconventional morality ?
The first level, preconventional morality , is most commonly found in children under
ten. There are two stages to level 1, obedience and punishment orientation and indi- 165PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPAN
How would you handle this moral dilemma?
Lawrence Kohlberg used this vignette in his research on moral development.He was less interested in the content of the answers—whether Heinz should
or should not have stolen the drug—than in the nature of the reasoning peopleused to come to a moral decision.
In Europe, a woman was near death from a special kind of cancer. Therewas one drug that the doctors thought might save her. It was a form ofradium that a druggist in the same town had recently discovered. Thedrug was expensive to make, but the druggist was charging ten timeswhat the drug cost him to make. He paid $200 for the radium andcharged $2,000 for a small dose of the drug. The sick woman’s husband,Heinz, went to everyone he knew to borrow the money, but he could onlyget together about $1,000 which is half of what it cost. He told the drug-gist that his wife was dying and asked him to sell it cheaper or let him paylater. But the druggist said: “No, I discovered the drug and I’m going tomake money from it.” So Heinz got desperate and broke in to the man’sstore to steal the drug for his wife. Should the husband have done that?
(Kohlberg, 1963, p. 19 quoted in Crain, 1985, p. 119)Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 165vidualism and exchange. In both cases, morality is determined by the consequences of
the action to the person performing the behavior—whether the individual is punishedor rewarded. In stage 1, the child equates what is right with what authority says isright. Often that is discernible by the punishment that follows. If you get punished,the behavior must be wrong. In stage 2, the child has learned that different people canhave different perspectives—that is, there can be more than one view of right andwrong. However, morality is still determined by the consequences of the event,whether the actor benefits or not. Additionally, there is a sense of exchange betweenpeople. Behavior may be wrong because the other person may retaliate or may fail tocooperate in the future.
What did Kohlberg mean by conventional morality ?
The second level is called conventional morality . This level covers stages 3 and 4,
Good Interpersonal Relationships and Maintaining the Social Order . In both stages,
morality of a behavior is determined by its effect on social relationships. At this pointthe person reasons in terms of how a behavior will affect relationships between people,not just the person performing the behavior. In stage 3, the person is concerned withthe emotional impact on an interpersonal relationship. The focus is on issues of empa-thy, care, and relief of suffering. In stage 4, the person recognizes the need for rulesthat all members of society must follow. For example, people should not steal becausesociety would become unmanageable if everybody stole.
What is meant by postconventional morality ?
The third and final level is called postconventional morality. This level contains stages5 and 6, which are termed social contract and individual rights and universal princi-
ples, respectively. In these stages, the person is interested in abstract concepts of jus-tice and a just society. At stage 5, the person recognizes the necessity for social rulesand laws, but also recognizes that laws themselves can be unjust. Therefore, there aretimes that a moral act may not be a legal act. At stage 6, the person considers theimportance of abstract, universal principles of justice and believes that laws should besubordinate to general moral principles. For example the value of a human life shouldoutweigh the law protecting private property. In his later research, Kohlberg aban-doned stage 6, saying that too few people actually reached this stage.
What criticisms have been leveled at Kohlberg’s theory?
Kohlberg’s great contribution was to say that moral development is dependent on cog-nitive development. A certain level of abstract thinking is necessary for mature moralreasoning. However, Kohlberg has been criticized for his overemphasis on intellectualdevelopment, as if intellect alone could account for moral maturity. Specifically, hefailed to recognize the importance of context. Moral reasoning reflects what is rele-
166Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 166vant to people in their own circumstances. For example, people in urban environ-
ments tend to score at stage 4, with an appreciation of the importance of impersonalrules that all people need to follow. In contrast, people from rural areas tend to scoreat stage 3, where moral judgments are based on consideration of interpersonal rela-tionships. In urban areas, where personal ties are eroded, behavior is regulated byimpersonal and formal laws. In small villages where everyone knows one another,behavior is regulated by the web of personal relationships.
What did Carol Gilligan say about Kohlberg’s theory?
In 1982, Carol Gilligan published “In a Different Voice,” which became a famous cri-tique of Kohlberg’s theory. Gilligan believed that Kohlberg’s theory was biased by anexclusively masculine viewpoint. She noted that the bulk of his subjects were maleand that his emphasis on abstract thought and impersonal laws reflected his mascu-line bias. Gilligan claimed that women are more likely to emphasize empathy, inter-personal relationships, and concern for the feelings of others and are, therefore, morelikely to score at level 3. This does not mean that women are less moral than men,only that they reasoned from a different set of values. While Gillligan’s critique raisesimportant points about Kohlberg’s prioritizing intellect over emotion, she also hasbeen criticized for over-simplifying the process of moral reasoning in women. Subse-quent research has shown that women are no more likely to score at level 3 than men.In general, both women and men take issues of justice and empathy into accountwhen making moral decisions.
THE ROLE OF CULTURE
Is childhood development the same for all cultures?
Grounded in our fundamental biology, much of childhood is the same across cultures.All children grow from infants to toddlers to children to adolescents. All learn to walkand talk and play and eventually to take part in the work of their society. All childrendevelop profound emotional attachments to their family and their primary caregivers.Moreover, all children have to develop an identity within their social group and to bal-ance self-expression with self-inhibition. Within these broad outlines, however, thereare many areas for cultural differences.
What are some of the ways that cultures differ?
While all children must learn to balance emotional expression with emotional inhibi-tion, cultures vary widely with regard to the freedom of emotional expression. Somecultures value open expression of deeply felt emotion and others value emotional
167PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPANHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 167restraint, believing public displays of
emotion to be vulgar. Cultures also varywidely with regard to the emphasis ondependence vs. independence, individual-ity vs. group orientation, and respect forauthority vs. individual freedoms. Addi-tionally different cultures have disparateviews on stability versus change and reli-gious tradition versus scientific thought.Cultures also differ with regard to theperceived value of intellectual develop-ment, of physical prowess or athleticism,and of sexual modesty. Moreover, culturesvary tremendously with regard to genderroles. Not only do different cultures varyfrom each other, but there is considerablevariation within cultures. People withinthe same culture can vary because ofsocioeconomic class, level of education,and where they grew up. All of these fac-tors influence the environment in whicha child develops.
When do cultural differences
become apparent?
In earliest development, cultural influ-
ences take a backseat to the role of biolo-
gy. With time, however, the impact of culture becomes more powerful. Cultural influ-ences are subtle in the infancy, toddler, and preschool years. By middle childhood,cultural differences become more central as the child is educated in the specific waysof his or her culture. By adolescence, cultural differences are even more acute, as ado-lescents prepare to take on an adult role within their own culture.
How do cultural differences complicate our theories of psychology?
Psychology is the study of the human mind and aims to find universal rules of humanbehavior. As the science of psychology developed in Western Europe and America,many psychological theories have been limited by a kind of cultural myopia, a shortsightedness. Aspects of psychological development that were assumed to be universalturn out to be culturally specific. This does not mean that all of our classic psycholog-ical theories are without merit, but we have to be cautious when assuming that whatis true in one culture is necessarily true in another.
168
A child’s psychological development can be influenced
considerably by the culture in which he or she is raised.Some cultures, for instance, frown on allowing too muchfree emotional expression, especially in public. Genderroles also vary widely from culture to culutre ( iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 168Are there cultural differences in patterns of attachment?
Attachment theory looks at the ways that children understand their emotional bonds
with key caregivers. However, cultures vary as to the expression of emotion, the value ofindependence, and the emphasis on intimacy. Consequently, the patterns of attachmentmay vary across cultures. Security of infant-mother attachment has been assessed inseveral different cultures, including Japanese, German, and American populations.
Interestingly, the proportion of securely attached infants, that is, infants who
appear to believe that their mother will be emotionally available, did not differ acrosscultures. Cultural differences were only found in the quality of insecure attachments.
In other words, no one country was any more likely to have unhealthy mother-infantpairs, but the nature of insecurely attached mother-infant dyads differed across thethree countries. For example, Japanese children were more likely to be classified anx-ious-resistant than were American children, showing much greater difficulty tolerat-ing separations from their mother. In contrast, German children were more likely tobe classified as anxious-avoidant than American children, reflecting their tendency tominimize their distress at separation from their mother. This brings to mind the Russ-ian novelist Leo Tolstoy’s famous saying that all happy families resemble one another,but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.
How have cultural differences affected theories of intellectual development?
Piaget found that high school students in elite schools in Geneva, Switzerland, weremore likely to demonstrate formal operational thought (his highest level of intellectu-al development) than were adolescents and adults with less rigorous scientific train-ing. This has been linked to the specific tests he used, which involved the solving ofbasic physics problems. As mentioned above, our intelligence develops through solv-ing problems that are directly relevant to us. Tests that do not take ecological validity
into account, therefore, are likely to be culturally biased. Ecological validity refers tothe extent to which a given test is appropriate to the context in which it is being used.
INFANCY
How important is development in the first year of life?
More development happens in the first year of life than at any other time after birth.During the first year, the body almost triples in weight and becomes about one-thirdlonger. Moreover, a newborn is unable to talk, crawl, move independently, or evenhold his or her head up. By the end of the first year, the typical child can crawl, manip-ulate objects, and is beginning to walk and talk. In fact, much of human development
169PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPANHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 169in the first year of life happens before birth in other species. For example, horses and
deer are ready to walk immediately after birth.
What are the major developmental milestones in the first year?
The major milestones in the first year of life include the social smile (two months),laughter (four months), the ability to sufficiently coordinate vision and grasp to playwith an object (four months), the ability to sit up (six months), the ability to eat solidfood (eight months), the ability to crawl (seven months), the ability to pull oneself upto a standing position (ten months), the ability to walk independently (twelvemonths), and the formation of words (twelve months).
What physical and behavioral milestones are typical during the first year of
development in a child?
The table below reflects the approximate age when most children show certain devel-opmental milestones. It is important to recognize, however, that children vary interms of the timing of their development.

What does a neonate know?
There is no question that neonates, or newborns, are born without much of the vastpsychological tools that adults have at their disposal. In contrast to an older view ofinfants as helpless, passive blobs, however, a wealth of infancy research has highlight-ed the skills that newborn infants bring into the world. For the most part, these skillshave to do with their sensory abilities. As this research shows, infants are born with asensory toolkit that allows them to actively make sense of their world as soon as theyare born—and to some extent even before birth.
170Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 170How do we study infants’ visual abilities?
Infants are born with the capacity to perceive and even remember a good deal of visual
information. But how do we know what infants are seeing? As they do not speak wecannot ask them. In the early 1960s a psychologist named Robert Franz started a revo-lution in infancy research by building a device that could monitor infants’ viewingpatterns by noting the reflections on their pupils. By determining which object waslooked at the longest when two objects were presented simultaneously, Franz was ableto infer which object the infant preferred.
What visual skills are infants born with?
Using Franz’s method and modifications on it, infancy researchers have shown thatinfants prefer curving lines to straight lines, patterns to plain surfaces, contrast tosameness, the edges of a shape to the center of a shape, and relatively complex designsto relatively simple designs. Infants also prefer to look at images of faces rather thanscrambled facial features. Finally, infants can only focus about eight to ten inchesfrom their face. All these visual tendencies prepare infants to interact with their moth-er, specifically to recognize and make sense of her face.
What other sensory skills do newborns have?
Infants are born with the capacity to recognize their mothers’ voice, which they havebeen able to hear throughout the last few months of pregnancy. Infants show prefer-
171PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPAN
Infants have specific visual abilities that help them recognize and relate to their parents. They prefer curved lines and human faces
over random features ( iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 171ence to female voices over male voices and high-pitched voices over lower-pitched
ones. Baby talk—or the use of high-pitched, simplified, repetitive, and highly melodicspeech patterns—is found across different cultures and different languages. By usingbaby talk, adults and older children reflexively adapt their speech patterns to infants’capabilities. Babies are also born with a developed sense of smell and the ability to dis-criminate sweet tastes from salty, bitter, or sour ones.
What evidence is there of infants’ capacity to remember?
There is a good deal of evidence supporting newborns’ ability to learn. Babies recog-nize their mother’s voice immediately after birth and within several days can recog-nize the smell of their mother’s breast milk. Within the first day of life infants canbe trained to suck longer on a nipple to hear a woman’s voice rather than a man’svoice. Babies also look longer at novel images and turn away sooner from imagesthat they have already seen multiple times. Eight-day-old babies also respond differ-ently to their mother if she wears a mask, looking at her more frequently duringfeeding as if recognizing something is not right. Thus, infants are born with thecapacity to store sensory information in memory and to make distinctions that arecritical for their survival.
What reflexes are infants born with?
Below is a list of primitive reflexes that infants are born with. Most of these disappear with-in the first year of life. It is likely that these reflect vestiges from our evolutionary past.
Reflex Description
Babkin The mouth opens in response to pressure on the palms.
Rooting The baby turns toward the stimulus if the cheek is stroked. This
prepares the child for nursing.
Grasping The fingers curl around and grasp onto any object that touches the palm.Moro When the infant is put down suddenly or startled, the arms and legs
extend outward.
Stepping The feet make stepping movements when the infant is held upright with
the feet touching a flat surface below.
Swimming Babies wave their arms and legs and hold their breath when underwater.Babinski When the bottom of the foot is stroked, the foot jerks upward and opens
up.
What do we know about the subjective experience of the infant?
Daniel Stern is an infancy researcher who has written several influential books on
infant psychology. In 1985 he published a book titled The Interpersonal World of the 172Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 172Infant, in which he asked the fascinating question: What is it liketo be a baby? He was
not only interested in what an infant can and cannot do, but what it feels like to expe-
rience the world from the infant’s perspective. Stern concluded that, to the infant, theworld was less like a smooth movie than a series of largely unrelated snapshots. Theinfant is first aware of the patterning of stimulation, the musical arrangement ofsight, sounds, smells, and touch. With time, these patterns of stimulation consolidateinto objects, and the objects settle into predictable routines. From this process, chil-dren develop an understanding of themselves in the world and of their relationshipwith other people.
What other aspects of social life develop in the first year of life?
Babies are born with the propensity to seek out interpersonal contact and to slowlylearn to make sense of the ebb and flow of social life. Babies learn to recognize facesand facial expressions, to take turns in a kind of proto-conversation, and to read inten-tion and meaning in the behavior of others. By four to six months, babies recognizediscrete facial expressions in their caregivers. By about one year, they engage in socialreferencing . In other words, before they explore a new toy or approach a stranger, they
look back at their mother to check herread on the situation. If the mothershows anxiety or fear, the baby will backoff. If the mother looks calm and confi-dent, the baby will approach the new situ-ation with interest.
What about emotions? How do
emotions develop in the first year
of life?
Emotions are a critical psychological tool
for the infant’s survival. By expressingemotion, infants communicate essentialinformation about their comfort andwell-being as well as their immediateneeds. Although infants are born with anemotional system in place, it is fairlycrude at birth. Newborns only demon-strate two kinds of emotion, distress andcalm. These are global emotional stateswith none of the nuance of the emotionalrepertoire of an adult. Within the first sixmonths, however, the infant begins to

body movements, infants express joy, sadness, anger, surprise, and fear.
What about temperament?
Throughout this chapter we have discussed the formative role of the environment inthe development of an infant. However, there is also a body of research that looks atinfant characteristics that may be inborn and not learned, a product of nature ratherthan nurture. Such characteristics are known as temperament . In 1956, Alexander
Thomas and Stella Chess initiated a decades-long study of temperament. This studyfollowed infants throughout childhood and adolescence into early adulthood. Theyidentified nine dimensions of temperament related to activity level and response tostimulation and stress.
These nine traits include: activity level, rhythmicity, approach/withdrawal, adapt-
ability, attention span and persistence, intensity of reaction, threshold of responsive-ness, and quality of mood. More recently, Mary Rothbart simplified Thomas andChess’s definition of temperament into two general categories, reactivity and self-reg-ulation. Her specific temperament dimensions included activity level, smiling andlaughter, fear, distress to limitations, soothability, and duration of orienting.
How stable is temperament over time?
Several studies have shown only low to moderate stability of temperament over time. Thismeans that children may change in terms of how they respond to stimulation and howwell they can self-soothe or exhibit some form of self-control. Temperament is least stablein the first two years of life. After the age of two, however, temperament is more stable.
Is temperament genetically based?
The pioneering research on temperament was conducted decades before the current rev-olution in genetic research. At the time there was no real way to separate the effects ofenvironment from the effects of genes. Now, however, there is more and more evidence ofgenetic contributions to various personality traits. Individual differences in sociabilityand shyness, impulsivity, anger control, and anxiety have all been shown to have a geneticbasis. Therefore the concept of a genetically based temperament that is first evident inearly childhood and persists into adulthood is supported by current research.
Does environment affect temperament?
Although temperament is presumed to be largely inborn, there is clear evidence thatit is affected by the environment. Some of the temperament dimensions listed by bothThomas and Chess and Rothbart are highly influenced by parental behavior, particu-
174Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 174larly the dimensions related to positive and negative emotion. Moreover, even geneti-
cally based traits can be strongly influenced by the environment. Therefore, how par-ents, family, and the general community respond to a certain temperament in a childcan modify the expression of that temperament.
For example, highly anxious and fussy children are more vulnerable to developing
anxiety disorders and depression. If such children are gently encouraged to expandtheir tolerance for social stimulation, they can avoid disabling social anxiety. Whilethey will probably never become gregarious extroverts, they can still develop socialcompetence. Likewise, extroverted and sensation seeking children are vulnerable todisorders of impulsivity, such as substance abuse and aggressive and/or illegal behav-ior. With appropriate guidance and limit setting, however, such children can learn toeffectively control their impulses.
TODDLER YEARS
What role does language play in the toddler years?
One of the cardinal features that distinguishes toddlers from infants is the use of lan-guage. Why is language so important? Language is a vehicle for symbolic thought.Unlike furniture or food, words are not useful objects in and of themselves. Words areuseful only in their ability to symbolize something else. Why is that important? The
capacity for symbolic thought removes the child from the prison of the here and now.Words take the child into the future and the past and to any place that can be imag-ined. Of course, words are also critical tools for communication. Prior to language theparent has to guess the child’s wants and needs. After children can talk, they can telltheir parents what they want.
Are there precursors to language?
The precursors to language start in the first few months of life. First the child mustdevelop the capacity for complex vocal sounds. At two months, babies start cooing, orproducing vowel sounds. At four months, they start babbling, which involves combi-nations of consonant and vowel sounds. Over the rest of the first year, the babblingbecomes increasingly complex and tailored to the native language of the child. Aroundten months, their babbling becomes strikingly melodic, mimicking the intonation andrhythm of their native language.
There is also unmistakable emotional content. In fact, it can be quite amusing to
listen to a ten-month-old baby clearly communicate emotion and intent in the com-plete absence of intelligible words. For example, an 11-month-old baby crawled intohis mother’s chair, which she had recently vacated. He picked up her coffee cup, and
175PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPANHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 175looked at her adult friend who had just been conversing with his mother. Putting his
elbow on the table, he immediately started babbling. “Ah bah doo be dah. Doo doo bah
me mah!” he said with evident purpose. “He thinks he’s talking,” his mother
explained. “He wants to join the conversation.”
How does language develop ?
By the end of the first year, the child has developed a vocabulary of single words. Atthis point, words may have overgeneralized meanings. “Kitty” may refer to any four-
legged animal. “Bus” may include any vehicle of transportation that has wheels. Bythe end of the second year, word usage is more accurate and the child is combiningwords into two-word sequences. This is known as telegraphic speech, where only the
most meaningful information is expressed, (e.g., “More juice,” “Want candy”). At thispoint, the child has a vocabulary of about 200 words. Over the next year, the childcombines more and more words together, eventually forming full sentences. Wordsare learned at a rate of about one to three words per week.
What are the typical stages of language development ?
The table below outlines the typical times that language skills develop:

(“Want juice,” “Mommy up!”)
3 years Sentences4 years Grammatical sentences, often with mistakes (“I holded the bunny”)6 years Vocabulary of 10,000 words
How does a child develop the concept of the self?
Another critical development during the toddler years is the development of a repre-
sentation of the self. This is not to say that babies have no awareness of themselvesprior to this period. From birth, infants have some sense of their physical selves basedin part on the correspondence between their movements and physical sensations.When they kick the blanket, they feel the cloth on their feet. However, infants lack aconcept of the self, a mental image of “Me.”
176Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 176In the toddler years, the child develops a mental concept of the self as a unique
individual who has goals and desires, who acts upon the environment, who interacts
with other people, and to whom other people have emotional responses. This giganticpsychological leap is evident in the first use of personal pronouns (I, me, mine), theemergence of self-conscious emotions (shame, embarrassment) and the recognition ofthe mirror image.
When do toddlers start using personal pronouns ?
Around age two, the toddler starts to use personal pronouns. They refer to themselvesas “I” or “me” and they refer to anything they possess (or wish to possess) as “mine.”Prior to using personal pronouns, toddlers might refer to themselves as “baby” or bytheir own name. Alternatively, they would use only verbs and nouns to express theirdesires (“want juice”), rather than identifying themselves as the source of the desire,as the one who desires.
How does possessive behavior relate to a toddler’s new self-concept?
The concepts of self and of personal property are young and fragile to a toddler and theyoften defend their newly recognized territory with great emotion. Consequently, they canbecome very possessive. At this point, caregivers must introduce the concept of sharing.Toddlers must begin to learn about self-control and social expectations. It is very difficult,however, for a toddler to accept the idea of deliberate self-sacrifice and parents must nothave unrealistic expectations of generous behavior in their newly assertive toddler.
How do self-conscious emotions reflect the emergence of the self?
The emergence of self-conscious emotions is another consequence of the concept ofthe self. One cannot feel shame if there is no self to feel bad about. The emotions ofshame, embarrassment, pride, and jealousy are recognizable from about eighteenmonths on. Shame or embarrassment is evident when children lower their eyes, hidetheir face, or hang their head. While such emotions may be painful for the child, theyare critical tools for socializing behavior. Humans are profoundly social animals, and achild needs to learn to inhibit various impulses and emotions in order to successfullyfunction in a social world. Self-conscious emotions create an inborn motivational sys-tem to avoid social disapproval and to seek out social approval.
What is the mirror test?
The mirror test is a famous test that is used to investigate the child’s concept of self. Amark is put on a child’s nose. When the child is put in front of a mirror, he or she willeither touch the reflected marking in the mirror image, or will touch the actual markingon his or her own nose. Children who touch their own nose recognize the image in the
177PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPANHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 177mirror as their own reflection. Most children can pass this test by eighteen months. Inter-
estingly, the mirror test has also been conducted on several species of great apes. Only afraction of chimpanzees, orangutans, or gorillas pass the mirror test, even as adults. Ingeneral, chimpanzees appear to do better than the other ape species on this test.
How do toddlers discover their will?
Along with a newly developed concept of the self comes a stronger sense of one’s ownwill. The toddler has discovered that he or she is an individual person with individualgoals. In contrast, infants respond to the world with generalized distress or content-ment. If bad things happen, they are unhappy. They become content again after the cir-cumstances change. In this regard, their emotional reactions are largely passive. Withdevelopment, however, children become less passive and more proactive. They learn topursue what will bring pleasure, and to avoid what will cause displeasure. This desire toimpact the environment in line with the child’s emotional responses is the basis of thewill. The child learns intentions. Unfortunately, once children discover their own will,they encounter the limits of their control. Willing something to be true does not makeit true. Moreover, one’s will is not necessarily aligned with the will of others.
Why do toddlers have temper tantrums?
Once toddlers develop awareness of their own will, they inevitably encounter the frus-tration of their will. This is very upsetting to the child and frustration can escalate into
178
The mirror test tells us about the development of the child’s concept of the self. In the first year, babies do not recognize t hemselves
in the mirror image. A baby is interested in the mirror but does not relate the reflection to the self. In contrast an older child is well
aware that the image in the mirror is her own reflection ( iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 178a full-fledged temper tantrum. A temper tantrum should be distinguished from the dis-
tress expressed by a younger baby. A temper tantrum is more than a simple reaction tonegative circumstances; it is an angry, defiant protest. The temper tantrum occurs notonly because the child is frustrated over a particular event, but because the child is out-raged at the very existence of frustration. In these moments, children are enraged that
they should have to be frustrated at all, that their will can actually be thwarted.
It takes some time for toddlers to adapt to this cold, hard truth. During this time
parents should be sensitive and patient with their child. While they should refrainfrom needless power battles, they should set appropriate limits, even if its causes thechild to throw a temper tantrum. In this stage, the child is learning to adapt to theworld as it is and not just how he or she might want it to be. Giving in to the tempertantrums of a child can undermine the child’s development of frustration tolerance.
How is toddler language a window into children’s cognitive development?
In the examples below, toddler language reveals key developmental processes. Vanessaspeaks in full sentences at two and a half and has clearly discovered the first personpossessive. Her emphasis on the word “my” reflects a critical step in the developmentof the sense of self. Her insistence on her privileged relationship with (if not owner-ship of) her mother also reflects the importance of mother-child attachment. Cogni-tively, she is in Piaget’s pre-operational stage. She does not realize that she cannot beboth granddaughter and grandfather to her own grandfather.
David’s speech is still largely telegraphic. His emphasis on the sound that a bus
makes (“Brrr”) reflects the importance of sensory-motor experience in the develop-ment of language. His interest in the gender of the bus driver reflects his newfoundfascination with grown men. At this age little boys first recognize their male gender.This is a fundamental step in their individuation from their mother; unlike theirmother, they are boys not girls.
These interchanges took place when Vanessa and her mother, Julie, were visiting
family after several months away.
Grandpa Baba: Vanessa, don’t you look cute today!
Vanessa: (Pause.) Baba is MYYYY granddaughter and MYYYY grandfather!
Uncle Daniel: Do you want to talk on the phone to Susan?
Vanessa: Susan! Daniel is MYYYY uncle!
Uncle Daniel: Vanessa, Julie is my sister. I am Julie’s brother.
Vanessa: (Pause. Clear consternation.)
JU-LEE … is … MYYYY mother!!!
JU-LEE … is … MYYYY mother!!!(Repeat five times)
179PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPANHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 179As is not uncommon with boys, when David was two years old, he was not as ver-
bally advanced as his older sister Vanessa had been at the same age. This interchange
took place as he watched his sister go off to kindergarten in a school bus.
David: Daya bye-bye brrrr man! Daya bye-bye brrrr ma-an!
Mom: (Translating) That means “Vanessa is going off to school in a school bus
driven by a man.”
What does the toddler understand about gender?
By the third year of life, the toddler can understand that they fit into various categories. In
particular, they learn that they belong to a specific gender; they are either a boy or a girl.For little boys, this is a fairly momentous discovery as their newly discovered masculinitymarks a dramatic break with their mother. While little girls are “girls” likeMommy; little
boys are “boys” unlike Mommy. Many little boys of this age become fascinated with adult
men, following them around like adoring puppies. This is not an early sign of sexual ori-entation, only the hero worship of a small boy toward a new role model.
PRESCHOOL YEARS (3–5)
What are the main developments of the preschool years?
Although the pace of development is not as dramatic in the preschool years as it isduring infancy and the toddler period, development still proceeds at a rapid rate.There are notable changes in body structure. There is a loss of body fat, a lengtheningof the legs and arms, and a flattening of the tummy. With a longer body, the child is nolonger all head and belly. At this point the child looks like a “kid” and no longer like ababy. Additionally, there is continued rapid brain growth, particularly in the left hemi-sphere, the cerebellum, and the frontal lobe. This corresponds with rapid increases inlanguage, motor coordination, and cognition and self-control, in that order.
What cognitive developments take place during the preschool years?
In general, cognitive development continues at a rapid pace during the preschoolyears. Improved language skills and the ability to count, play games, and even begin toread and write all reflect advances in the preschool child’s cognition. The developmentof symbolic thought is of particular importance.
What advances in symbolic thought take place in the preschool years?
While the toddler learns to symbolize objects and events that are not present, thepreschool child learns to manipulate objects and events in his or her own mind. In
180Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 180other words, the preschool child is capable of imagination. Not only can preschool
children refer to something that is not present, they can change it in their mind. Thissignificant shift opens the door to pretend play, to fantasy, and even to lying.
What is magical thinking?
The capacity for imagination develops ahead of logical abilities. Thus, preschool chil-dren are prone to a kind of reasoning known as magical thinking. This involves faulty
reasoning about causation. The child develops hypotheses about causation that areunchecked by mature logic. For example, the superstitious saying “if you step on acrack, you’ll break your mother’s back” reflects magical thinking. Likewise, a childmight attribute the rain to God’s tears or thunder to giants moving furniture.
Another aspect of magical thinking involves animistic thinking, in which children
attribute lifelike qualities, such as wishes, fears, thoughts, and intention, to inanimateobjects. For example after the wind blows the door shut, a child might say, “Mr.Nobody shut the door.” In keeping with their tendency toward magical thinking, chil-dren of this age are particularly drawn to fantasy stories. The clear enjoyment withwhich children this age engage in fantasy is particularly appealing to adults,thus encouraging the persistence of stories of Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny andother related fantasy figures.
Why do children see monsters in the closet at night?
The ability of preschool children to create fantasy precedes their ability to distinguish
fantasy from external reality. The lack of clear distinction between fantasy and realitycan be a drawback. A scary story can seem very real to a preschool child, even whenreminded that it is only pretend. Many preschool children become afraid of monstersin their closet at night. Although they see that the closet contains only clothing whenthe lights are on, they fear that their shirts and pants can change into monsters assoon as the lights go out. This phenomenon relates to Piaget’s concept of pre-opera-tional thought. The child does not yet have a solid grasp on how objects change andhow they stay the same. Such a changeable world can be very scary at times.
What kind of pretend play takes place in the preschool years?
In keeping with the new capacity for fantasy, children this age are very drawn to pre-tend play. They love to play dress-up, to pretend to be parents, to play house, or to imi-tate adult roles that they see in their life, such as a teacher, fireman, or doctor. Whilesome pretend play is evident in the toddler years, it is much more elaborated in thepreschool years. A toddler may pretend to talk on the phone or dress up in Mommy’sshoes, but a preschool child enacts whole stories, with different children assigned dif-ferent roles in the drama.
181PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPANHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 181What does “theory of mind” mean?
Theory of mind refers to the ability to
understand the nature of the mind, torecognize that people experience theworld through their beliefs. The under-standing that all people have uniquemental perspectives develops graduallyacross childhood. In the preschool years,children master the concept of false
beliefs. In other words, children grasp:that our beliefs are not equal to externalreality; that one person’s beliefs can bedifferent from another person’s beliefsand that our beliefs shape our actions.Development of this skill is a critical stepin socialization, in the ability to manageinterpersonal relationships. People with
autism, a psychiatric disorder characterized by interpersonal skills deficits, arebelieved to lack adequate theory of mind.
What is the false belief task?
There are a number of false belief tasks that have been used to study the theory ofmind as understood by a child of preschool age. In one such test, a child is shown twoboxes. One is marked “band-aids” and the other is not. The child is asked which boxcontains band-aids. Most children point to the marked box. After this they are shownthat the band-aids are actually kept in the unmarked box. When the question isrepeated, they now point to the unmarked box. Next, the children are introduced to apuppet named Pam. They are then asked to point to the box where Pam believes theband-aids to be. While typical three-year-olds will point to the unmarked box, the typi-cal four-year-old will point to the marked box, thus demonstrating an understandingof Pam’s false belief.
In what ways does self-control improve in the preschool years?
One of the critical developmental challenges of the preschool years involves the mas-tery of emotions and impulses. Although seeds of this process are evident in the tod-dler years, we do not expect much in the way of self-control in a child under the age ofthree. In the preschool years, however, self-control dramatically improves. Childrenthis age master various strategies for controlling their impulses and emotions. In theface of negative emotions, they learn to distract themselves or to change their goals(for example, abandoning a contested toy in favor of a new, available toy). They alsouse speech to regulate their actions, reminding themselves out loud how they are sup-
182
These children are engaged in pretend play. The capacity for
fantasy is one of the hallmarks of the preschool years ( iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 182posed to behave. Likewise, their understanding of their own emotions and the emo-
tions of others increases. They use more feeling words and better understand howemotion motivates behavior. These developments have significant social implications.
What role do friendships play in the preschool years?
In keeping with the profound developments in self-control, social understanding, andemotional awareness, there is a new emphasis on peer relationships. Preschool chil-dren now have a basic capacity for peer-to-peer relationships. Although toddlers showinterest in other children, they do not have the capacity to relate to other childrenwithout constant adult intervention. In contrast, preschool children are capable ofenduring, emotionally important relationships with other children. Preschool chil-dren can make friends. This is not to say that preschool friendships are completely
mature. Quite the opposite. At this age, friendships are highly unstable and prone toconstant disruptions. Minor conflict often leads to a declaration of the end of thefriendship: “Johnny isn’t my friend anymore!” Luckily the bad times are generallyshort lived and once the storm passes, the friendship resumes: “OK, Johnny, you canbe my friend again.”
What are some examples of preschool children’s language ?
When the interchanges listed below took place, Josh was between four and five yearsold and his sister Alex was two years older. These quotes were recorded by their moth-er. Note how Josh, who is in the preschool stage, is drawn to fantasy and imaginativethinking. Despite his verbal skills, he does not yet fully understand the rules of logicor the difference between reality and fantasy. In contrast, his older sister, Alex, is inPiaget’s stage of concrete operations. At this age, she understands the basic rules oftransformation, how objects and people change, and how they stay the same.
Josh: Dolphins can dance on their tails and flop onto their tummies.
Mom: How do they dance on their tails?Josh: They have purple shoes on.
Josh: When I grow up, I’m going to be a train.
Alex: You can’t be an an imal or a machine. You have to be a man cause
that’s the way God made you. You can be whatever you want to be like
a doctor or teacher, but you have to be a man cause that’s the way it is.
(Josh and Alex are fighting over toys.)
Alex: Josh, let’s trade.
Josh: OK, I want both.
Josh: No, you can’t eat that for breakfast. Breakfast comes from on top of
the fridge.
183PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPANHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 183How do preschool children
understand morality?
With the gains in self-control and social
competence, the preschool child alsodevelops the beginnings of a moral sense.Concern with a dawning morality is fre-quently evident in pretend play, which isoften populated with cops and robbersand bad people getting sent to jail. A childthis age has a rudimentary concept ofright and wrong and of good and bad.These concepts are largely based on adultbehavior. If an adult tells them a behavioris wrong, particularly if they are punishedfor it, they learn that the behavior is con-sidered “bad.” A preschool child’s conceptof morality is very crude, however. It is
simplistic, rigid, and sometimes self-serving. “OK, we can share, but I want both,” afive-year-old boy told his sister when she suggested dividing a piece of cake in half.
With time the child begins to internalize parental standards, basing moral under-
standing not only on what parents say, but on the child’s own personal standards ofright and wrong. Moreover, as their cognitive development progresses, their moralunderstanding gains sophistication. How well the parents teach morality and instilldiscipline profoundly influences the child’s ability to develop mature and effectivemoral standards. If parental discipline is overly rigid and harsh, overly permissive, orarbitrary and inconsistent, children will be hampered in their understanding of rightand wrong. Children whose parents explain moral standards and point out the effect ofaggressive actions on other people develop better social skills.
What gender differences are evident at this age?
By the age of four, boys and girls have developed notable differences in their play andin their choice of playmates. By the age of six, children spend eleven times as muchtime with same-sex as opposite-sex peers. Although there is always considerable indi-vidual variation, on average boys are more likely than girls to engage in rough-and-tumble play, verbal and physical aggression, and large group activities. Girls, on theother hand, prefer activities that involve verbal interaction and fine motor skills andare more sensitive to emotional reactions both in themselves and in other children.
Girls also express aggression differently. They are less likely to use physical vio-
lence, but more likely to attempt to undermine other’s friendships, disrupting the net-work of personal relationships that are so important for girls. Gender-typed behavior

By the age of six, both boys and girls tend to spend more
time with same-sex playmates than with the opposite sex.(iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 184is strongly influenced by environment and there is tremendous variation across cul-
tures in the ways that the different genders are socialized. Nonetheless, there is alsostrong evidence of a biological basis to gender differences. Sex hormones, such asandrogens and estrogen, seem to play an important role.
SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN (6–11)
What are the major changes in the school-age years?
The school-age years extend roughly from ages six through 11. Otherwise known asmiddle childhood, these are years of relative stability. The child has mastered the cog-nitive, linguistic, emotional, and social challenges of early childhood and is now capa-ble of participating in the social world. School-age children are ready to join society,not as independent participants—children this age still need considerable adult super-vision—but as junior members of the social world. They are capable of learning thefundamentals of adult work, of building and managing peer relations, and of under-standing and respecting social rules. Many parents find these the easiest years of par-enting, with the enormous demands of infancy and early childhood behind them andthe upheaval of adolescence yet to come.
Why are the school-age years called the latency years?
Freud referred to this period as the latency period, in which the passions of the earlierpsychosexual stages calm down, go underground so to speak, only to re-emerge inadolescence. Latency-aged children devote their energy to the mastery of skills, partic-ularly those taught in school. Erikson’s stage of Industry vs. Inferiority also speaks tothis observation, suggesting that the latency years are focused on mastery, with pow-erful implications for a child’s basic sense of competence.
What kinds of motor development take place at this age?
Children’s physical growth during this period is regular and continuous. It is not atime of dramatic physical changes. Nonetheless, important changes do take place. Thechild continues to grow in height and weight, with most of their growth in the lowerpart of their body. Children become longer and leaner, continuing to stretch out fromthe rounded mass of head and belly characteristic of the infancy and toddler years.Motor coordination also develops. Children make considerable advances in both grossmotor and fine motor skills. Improvements in coordination, balance, flexibility andpower allow them to develop skills such as writing and drawing, as well as to engagein complex and physically demanding sports.
185PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPANHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 185What kind of cognitive changes take place in this period?
School-age children are in Piaget’s concrete operational stage. In other words, they
can make sense of the physical world and understand how objects behave in space andtime. While six-years-olds may still have some trouble with conservation tasks, by ageseven most children have a basic understanding of these concepts.
Other cognitive skills are also important. School-age children have a more sophis-
ticated sense of classification. They understand that objects can belong to differentcategories and that categories can be hierarchically arranged. For example, a child cancollect baseball cards of left-handed pitchers or of third basemen in the AmericanLeague. They can also rearrange these categories, to collect left-handed pitchers in theAmerican League. Their understanding of number, of sequencing, and of spatial rela-tionships also grows. Language also continues to develop and by the end of this stagechildren have an average vocabulary of 40,000 words.
Because of this ongoing cognitive development, children are ready to learn skills
needed for adult life. In industrialized societies, this involves academic skills. Reading,writing, and arithmetic are three academic skills that school-age children have tomaster in industrialized and economically developed countries.
How do children develop emotionally during the school-age years?
Cognitive and emotional development move forward together. With their increasedcognitive capacities, children have a growing understanding of emotions in boththemselves and others. School-age children understand that people are motivated bytheir internal states rather than by situations alone. Children this age also master theconcept of mixed feelings, that people can have more than one emotion at a time.Children advance in their ability to regulate their own emotions, to tolerate frustra-tion, to delay gratification, and to distract themselves from distress. Their capacity forempathy is heightened. They understand that people suffer not only from momentaryfrustrations, but also from longstanding life circumstances. Thus, they can appreciatethe concept of charity, which is beyond the grasp of a preschool child. Their self-con-scious emotions also advance, heightening their social capacities, but also opening upnew areas of psychological vulnerability.
What kinds of social developments occur in this period?
This is the age when children truly become social beings. Prior to the school-ageyears, children have primary formative relationships with their adult caregivers. Inthe preschool years, they develop friendships with other children, but are not undulyinfluenced by the inevitable crises of these relationships. In the school-age years, how-ever, peer relationships become much more central. Entering this period, childrenhave already mastered a rudimentary understanding of the minds of others, the differ-
186Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 186ence between right and wrong, and some degree of frustration tolerance and impulse
control. These critical skills continue to solidify in the school-age years, supportingthe development of peer relationships. Children have internalized moral standards tosome extent, and there is a basic concept of fairness and justice which persists even inthe absence of an adult. Children have developed a repertoire of tools to manage con-flict in peer relationships, such as sharing, compromising, helping, and seeing thingsfrom another’s perspective.
How do peer relations change in the school-age years?
Peer relationships take on much greater importance in the school-age years than atany earlier point in childhood. Children develop enduring and close friendships thatcan last into adulthood. Children understand the concept of behavioral patterns andchoose friends according to their personality traits, how they behave over time.
This is where children with poor social skills can run into trouble. While disrup-
tive children may be off-putting in early childhood, the social impact is transient andcan be easily rectified. Every day is a new day. In middle childhood, however, suchbehavior can have a detrimental impact on the child’s ability to form and maintainfriendships, which can have long lasting effects on the child’s self-esteem.
Additionally, children are now relating to other children as part of a social group
and not simply on a one-to-one basis. School-age children must therefore begin tonegotiate the complexities of group dynamics. Such issues include in-groups and out-groups, group hierarchy and social status, leaders and followers, and conformity andresistance to group norms. Although such issues will be sharply accentuated in ado-lescence, they are first encountered dur-ing the school-age years.
Why are rules so important at
this age?
Cognitively, academically, and socially,school-age children are trying to masterthe way that things are supposed to be.Children can now understand the conceptof impersonal rules that all people have tofollow regardless of their preferences. Ineffect, school-age children have an under-standing of the social contract. They arealso learning the rules of their new skills,how to read, write, and add and subtractnumbers. Thus, the desire for stable andpredictable rules is a central characteristic
187PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPAN
While some rules might seem unreasonably strict, research
shows that children need limits and rules as part of theirnormal, healthy development (iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 187of school-age children. This emphasis on rules shows up in their play, in their attraction
to board games, video games, and clapping games. It shows up in their rule-basedmorality (“Ooh! You said ‘stupid’! You’re not supposed to say ‘stupid’!”) and their greatsensitivity to perceived unfairness (“That’s not fair! He went first last time!”).
Why do kids bully?
Psychology has traditionally had a rather idealistic view of social life, assuming thataggression in children was a manifestation of some sort of psychopathology. Unfortu-nately, psychology has proven itself rather naïve in this regard. Current research hasnow caught up with Hollywood and television, showing that childhood aggression isoften socially rewarded. While some aggressive children are maladjusted, emotionallytroubled, and disliked by their peers, other children use aggression quite effectively togain social status. Boys are more likely than girls to bully other children, using verbaland physical aggression. However, girls are still capable of using relational aggression,or social ostracism, to enhance their own status within a group.
With time, however, children who bully fall out of favor, alienating other children
with their cruelty. As bullying is a common behavior among children—by some esti-mates 10 to 20 percent of children are bullies—the most effective means to reducebullying is to promote a culture in which bullying is neither condoned nor tolerated.
188What do clapping games tell us about school age children?
The little girls’ clapping game rhyme below dates back as far as the U.S. CivilWar. More or less unchanged, this game is found in multiple countries and
across the United States. The remarkable stability of these games reflects theimportance of rules for school age children and contrasts dramatically with theever-changing nature of adolescent slang.

Between 15 to 30 percent of children are repeatedly victimized by bullies, according to
some estimates. Children who are shy, unassertive, and passive, with low self-esteem andan anxious temperament are particularly vulnerable to bullies. Overprotective parentsactually increase their children’s risk of being targeted by bullies by hampering theirindependence and self-confidence and enhancing their sense of passivity and dependen-cy. While such children should never be blamed for the being victims, they can benefitfrom interventions that increase their social skills, assertiveness, and initiative.
How important is it for a child to do well in school?
A child’s performance in school is critically important on a number of levels. For one,the academic skills learned in the school-age years form the foundation of all laterlearning. If a child never masters reading, he or she will be at a serious disadvantage.In our information-based society, a high level of literacy is vital for occupational oreconomic success. Perhaps even more importantly, though, a child’s experience inschool powerfully influences his or her self-concept. Children at this age are capableof comparing themselves to others in a meaningful way. They have some idea of socialstanding and of social categories.
Nonetheless, they still tend to think in global terms and have some difficulty dis-
tinguishing whether their behavior reflects particular circumstances or a general per-sonality trait. In other words, did they fail the test because they need new glasses andcouldn’t read the blackboard or because they’re bad at math? Thus, children’s schoolexperience leads to a global, generalized sense of their own competence. If they feel“bad at school,” their lowered self-confidence will diminish their initiative and theirpersistence in the face of challenge. If they feel “good at school,” their positive self-concept will enhance initiative, frustration tolerance, and self-discipline, and alsoencourage higher academic and occupational goals.
What are learning disabilities and why are they important?
Learning disabilities refer to a biologically based deficit in specific cognitive skills inthe face of normal intelligence. For example, some children have particular difficultyin maintaining focused attention (e.g., ADHD), in reading letters in the correctsequence (e.g., dyslexia), or in organizing information in space (e.g., non-verbal learn-ing disability). When these difficulties are undiagnosed, children can have repeatedexperiences of failure in the classroom. This can lead to low self-esteem and someassociated negative behaviors, such as a defensive rejection of criticism.
Some children with undiagnosed learning disabilities feel so bombarded by criti-
cism and feelings of failure that they simply shut out negative feedback, with pre-dictable consequences. Children with learning disabilities may develop disruptive
189PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPANHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 189behaviors and have an increased risk of becoming involved in antisocial behaviors in
adolescence. To some extent, this is related to biological deficits in impulse control,but it is also related to problematic reactions after repeated experiences of failure.
ADOLESCENCE (12–18)
What physical changes take place in adolescence?
Unlike middle childhood, which is a period of predictable and gradual change, adoles-cence is a time of abrupt and dramatic transformation. To start with, there are tremen-dous physical changes. The child becomes an adult and the body dramatically changesform, frequently leaving young adolescents surprised and disoriented by their new andalien body. “I didn’t know where my feet were,” one young man described his feelings,referring to the year he grew ten inches in about as many months. “And everyonewanted me to play basketball,” he added.
What physical changes take place in adolescence? Both boys and girls undergo
tremendous growth spurts. While the typical American ten-year-old is about 4’7”,the median height for seventeen-year-olds is about 5’8” for boys and 5’4” for girls.The shape of the body changes as well, with lengthening of the trunk, arms and legsand enlargement of the hands and feet. The face also changes, with growth of thenose, jaw, and cheekbones. Often the ears and nose grow before the rest of the face.In North American girls, the growth spurt starts around ten and is completed byabout age sixteen. In North American boys, the growth spurt begins around twelveor thirteen and is completed by about seventeen or eighteen. Most adolescents addabout ten inches in height and gain about fifty to seventy-five pounds. Additionally,there are tremendous hormonal and physiological changes associated with puberty.
What transpires during puberty?
During puberty, the body transforms into a sexually mature state, with the adolescentnow capable of sexual reproduction. This takes place about two years earlier in girlsthan in boys. Girls start puberty around age twelve and complete it in about fouryears. In both sexes, a flood of hormones is released by various glands in the body.Growth hormone and thyroxine stimulate the increase in body size.
For boys, most of the hormones are released by the testes. The androgen (or male
hormone) testosterone leads to muscle growth, body and facial hair, and the develop-ment of male sexual characteristics. Boys also release a small amount of estrogen,which stimulates release of growth hormone. This in turn stimulates growth in bodysize and bone density. By the end of puberty, boys have developed greater muscle massthan girls and their shoulders have widened relative to their waist and hips.
190Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 190In girls, hormones are released from
the ovaries. Estrogen release results in
maturation of the breasts, uterus, andvagina, an accumulation of body fat, andan increase in the hip to waist ratio. Ingirls but not boys, androgen release fromthe adrenal glands (right above the kid-neys) results in increased height as well asthe growth of pubic and underarm hair.Menarche, the beginning of menstrua-tion, begins around age 12.5, althoughthis can vary widely depending on manyfactors, including diet.
What kind of changes take place in
the brain during puberty?
Adolescence is a time of dramatic changes inbrain organization as well. Early in adoles-cence there is marked growth in brain graymatter, particularly in the frontal lobe. Thisis caused by a burst of synaptogenesis, thecreation of synaptic connections betweenneurons. Following this growth spurt, how-ever, there is increased pruning, whichrefers to the dying off of unused synapses and dendrites. This enhances efficiency in thebrain by ridding the brain of unused circuitry, like throwing out clothes that are never worn.
Myelination also continues, which enhances the speed and efficiency of electrical
impulses traveling through the brain. This increase in brain connectivity and efficien-cy results in profound changes in cognitive abilities, bringing about a seismic shift inthe adolescent’s understanding of the world.
Additionally, there are changes in the density of neurotransmitters, the chemical
messengers that help neurons communicate with each other. Changes in the level ofexcitatory neurotransmitters (such as glutamate and dopamine) relative to the level ofinhibitory neurotransmitters (such as GABA) may make adolescents more reactive toemotional stimuli, possibly contributing both to the emotional turbulence and thrill-seeking tendencies commonly found in adolescents.
What cognitive changes take place in adolescence?
According to Piaget, adolescents are capable of formal operational thought. Primarily, thismeans that adolescents can reason from the possible instead of just the concrete and the
191PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPAN
Everyone knows the body goes through tremendous physical
changes during puberty, including hair growth and increasedproduction of hormones that ready the body for sexualreproduction. Such drastic changes can be a lot to adjust to,making puberty a trying time in life ( iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 191tangible. School-age children can explain the behavior of objects that are directly in front
of them. However, they are not yet skilled at imagining the different possible actions of
objects and then reasoning from these imagined possibilities. In contrast, adolescents canreason from the possible, or hypothetical, instead of just from the concrete or tangible.Consequently, adolescents are capable of abstract thought . They can reason in terms of
verbal concepts, such as social justice, political conservatism, or religious doctrine.
Additionally, adolescents are capable of metacognition , which refers to the ability
to think about thought, their own thought as well as that of others. Likewise, adoles-cents are capable of grasping the rules of logic as concepts in and of themselves. Theycan critique the logic of another person’s argument, a skill that was not available tothem during the school-age period. This new logical ability is not always welcomed byparents faced with a child who is now capable of criticizing their reasoning. A two-year-old rebels by shouting, “No! No! No!” An eight-year-old pouts and cries, “That’s notfair!” But a sixteen-year-old can point out contradictions in their parents’ arguments.
How do the cognitive changes affect the academic abilities of adolescents?
The capacity for abstract thought, for logical analysis, and for metacognition preparesthe way for an explosion of academic pursuits. Of course, these cognitive capacities arestill in their earliest stages of development in early adolescence, and do not reach fullflower until late adolescence. In fact, the capacity for abstract thought continues togrow well into adulthood. Likewise, full development of these cognitive abilities isheavily dependent on environment, on the adolescent’s exposure to relevant educationand experience. What differentiates adolescents from school-age children is the capac-
ityfor abstract thought, not always the performance of it.
Nonetheless, adolescents are capable of learning about theory in ways younger
children simply cannot grasp. They can learn about religion, philosophy, mathemat-ics, politics, and sociology. For the first time, adolescents can develop their own ideasabout these topics, and not simply parrot the opinions of their parents. Although ado-lescents are capable of understanding these abstract concepts, their viewpoints stilldiffer from those of adults. They tend toward grand generalizations, particularly insocial and political ideas, with little appreciation for complexity and nuance. In fact,there is a saying about adolescents’ understanding of politics that has been attributedto various people, including Winston Churchill and Victor Hugo. “Whoever is not asocialist in their youth has no heart. Whoever remains one in old age has no head.”This is not to promote one political theory over another, but to illustrate how adoles-cents’ understanding of abstract concepts is more simplistic than that of older adults.
Why are adolescents so self-conscious?
The shift in adolescents’ cognitive abilities has far-reaching implications for theirsocial lives as well as their view of themselves. Their ability to put themselves in
192Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 192other’s shoes, to take another’s perspective, continues to develop. Moreover, they rec-
ognize that there are levels of human behavior and motivation. What is shown to the
public is not necessarily the whole picture. There can be feelings that are covered by apublic mask. Hidden motivations can drive behavior. When they appreciate that theycan see behind other peoples’ surfaces, they realize their own interior lives might beequally visible. There is a tremendous feeling of exposure. It’s almost as if everyonearound them has developed X-ray vision and they are suddenly naked.
The intense self-consciousness of the typical adolescent is well known. Young ado-
lescents, in particular, become extremely self-conscious about their appearance andare prone to mortifying feelings of embarrassment. The wrong shoelaces, pant length,hair style—all of these can trigger a crisis of self-consciousness as well as peerridicule. These difficulties are at their height in early adolescence, in the first half ofthe teens. By the late teens, adolescents’ self-consciousness diminishes. Older adoles-cents recognize that regardless of the visibility of their personal quirks and foibles,such matters are of little or no interest to the rest of the world. Most people are far toowrapped up in their own concerns to waste precious energy and attention on anotherperson’s minor imperfections. Older adolescents also realize that their inner strugglesand failures are far from unique. Thus, there is little reason to feel shame, since theseexperiences are widely shared.
What role does identity development have during adolescence?
Erikson considered adolescence to be a critical time for identity development. For thefirst time in their lives, adolescents are challenged to develop a view of themselves thatis separate from their relationship with their parents. They can no longer simply seethemselves as somebody’s child. They will have to find a role within adult society, whichis no simple task in our complex, modern society. Moreover, adolescents’ cognitivedevelopment allows them to understand abstract notions of values and of religious andpolitical beliefs. The beliefs they endorse become an important part of their identity.
This process of identity formation also relates to an excessive concern with peer
acceptance. When one’s identity is in flux, the reactions of other people become thatmuch more important. In other words, people who are unsure of their own identitytend to give their peers more power to define who they are, while those with a stableself-identity are less easily influenced by the opinions of others.
What happens when there are social barriers to identity formation
in adolescence?
In all cultures, it is a developmental task of adolescence to move toward an adult role insociety. What happens when such roles are not available? Perhaps the society is in disar-ray, due to war or political or economic chaos. Alternatively, certain subgroups of thepopulation may be barred from productive participation in society, due to poverty, lack of
193PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPANHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 193education, and/or racial or ethnic prejudice. When constructive social roles are not readi-
ly available, destructive or antisocial group identities become viable alternatives. Forexample, disenfranchised youths (particularly young males) may be inducted into streetgangs or criminal organizations. As such, psychological development in adolescence isheavily dependent on the surrounding culture, more so than at any earlier period.
What kinds of emotional changes do adolescents undergo?
For many reasons, adolescence is a time of intensified emotions. The upsurge in hor-mones, the changes in brain function, and the adolescent’s own psychological reac-tions to massive physical, cognitive, and social changes all contribute to this emotion-al upheaval. In fact, brain imaging research has shown that the amygdala, anemotional center of the brain, is more responsive to emotional stimuli during adoles-cence than at any other time in life.
Adolescents are known to be moody, dramatic, and to react intensely to seeming-
ly minor problems. Likewise, this is a time of increased vulnerability to mental ill-ness. In fact, many psychological and psychiatric disorders have their start in adoles-cence, including depression, eating disorders, drug abuse, and even schizophrenia.This is not to suggest that all adolescents develop emotional problems; quite theopposite, in fact. Nonetheless, adolescence is typically a time of some emotionalupheaval, which can set the stage for the development of psychopathology in vulner-able individuals.
How does a child’s relationship with parents change during adolescence?
Adolescence is a time of radical transformation of the parent-child relationship.Both parent and child must find a way to renegotiate the relationship so that thechild’s growing independence is not stifled, but the child is not allowed too muchfreedom. Although the stereotype of battling parents and teens is exaggerated andmost adolescents have reasonably harmonious relationships with their parents,there is clearly an increase in conflict between children and parents when childrenreach their teens. Parents and adolescents conflict over the teen’s desire for greaterprivacy, for reduced discipline, for greater freedom to choose friends and to spendtime with them away from home. Adolescents fare best when their parents canloosen the reins but not let go entirely. Moreover, the adolescent’s increased logicalabilities allow for reasoned discussions between parents and children about whatshould and should not be allowed.
Why does adolescent slang change over the years?
In contrast to school aged children’s preference for the routine and predictable, ado-lescents prize the new and contemptuously dismiss the old and familiar. We can con-

How do peer relationships change during adolescence?
In modern Western society, peer relationships have enormous influence during ado-
lescence. Relationships with peers, acceptance by peers, and the adolescent’s role andstatus in peer groups become of utmost importance. Peer relationships can be asource of great fun and excitement, but can also bring pain and humiliation whenthey do not go well.
What lies behind this greatly enhanced emphasis on peers? For one, in the move-
ment away from dependence on parents, the adolescent turns toward peers as replace-ments for the family. Secondly, the adolescent’s increased perspective-taking capacitiesand greater understanding of emotional life allow for a level of intimacy with peers thatwas not possible earlier. As adolescents gain better understanding of their own motiva-tions and emotional experience, they have greater capacity for empathy.
The ability and desire to share intimate experience creates intense bonds between
friends. Initially, these intimate relationships are largely with friends of the same gen-Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 196Why do adolescents dress so strangely?
Adolescents are in the process of
establishing their own identity
while also establishing independencefrom their parents. Adolescent fash-ion trends often reflect these dualgoals. Many styles that become popu-lar with adolescents reflect rejectionof basic adult norms and assumptionsabout self-presentation. For examplefrom earliest childhood, parentsteach their children that clothesshould be neat, clean, orderly, andattractive, and should promote asocially acceptable image. In con-trast, consider the adolescent fash-ions of the 1960s in which clotheswere ripped and tattered and hair waslong and shaggy. In the hip-hop style,which has lasted with some changessince the 1980s, clothes are baggyand fit poorly, modeled after the belt-less pants of incarcerated prisoners.The goth style promotes a morbidimage of violence and religious trans-gression. These rebellious styles oftenexude a good deal of vitality, and fre-quently become absorbed (and dilut-ed) into mainstream fashion.
Parents often are puzzled, and even worried, when their
teenage children begin to dress unconventionally or changetheir appearance in other ways, but this is actually a verycommon expression of the search for self-identity ( iStock).PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPAN
197der. The tendency toward chumship, or intense same-sex friendships, in early adoles-
cence is slowly supplanted by romantic relationships in later adolescence, althoughsame-sex friendships retain great importance throughout adolescence.
Why is it so important to be popular?
More than ever before, adolescents are highly attuned to the dynamics of the socialgroup. We are all familiar with the phenomena of cliques, popularity, peer pressure,and terms such as “coolness” and “geekiness.” These all represent aspects of adoles-cent social organization. Just as wolf packs organize into hierarchies of social status,Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 197so do human societies. In adolescence, when children move away from their parents
toward membership in a new social group, these markers of social organizationbecome acutely important. Boundaries between the in group and the out group andbetween the elite and low status individuals are communicated fluently through a sys-tem of ever-changing symbols. Group etiquette and rituals are reflected in language,clothing, cars, electronic gadgets, and taste in music.
Adults are constantly astonished at the importance placed on a seemingly trivial
distinction in shoe style, haircut, or method of folding a baseball cap, but woe to theadolescent who misses out on such distinctions. Why are adolescents so painfullyobsessed with these signs of group acceptance and social status? If these are universalaspects of human social organization, why don’t adults place the same importance onpopularity and peer acceptance? Adults are not immune to consideration of social sta-tus. Consider the market for luxury cars and designer clothes, as well as the impor-tance of occupational and financial success to many adults’ self-esteem. However,adults can put such issues in greater perspective.
Unlike adolescents whose acute self-consciousness makes them magnify any
social gaffe into world-shattering proportions, adults are more forgiving of their ownand others’ social imperfections. They are also better able to distinguish betweensocial relationships that truly matter to them and those that have less relevance totheir daily lives.
What role does sexuality play in adolescence?
One of the greatest changes adolescents undergo involves sexuality. In puberty theytransition from pre-sexual children into sexually mature individuals who are capableof conceiving and/or bearing children. In general, sexual maturity precedes emo-tional maturity, and young teens are often faced with feelings and social demandsthat they are not emotionally ready for. The age of puberty has come earlier and ear-lier over the past century. Initially, this development reflected improvements innutrition and adolescent health. In more recent years, however, the earlier timing ofpuberty may have more to do with changes in the environment, specifically withhormones in the food. Moreover, in our highly complex, industrialized society, thefull adult role is reached far later than in simpler societies. Thus, the period duringwhich an adolescent is sexually mature but not yet inhabiting a fully adult role hasgreatly lengthened over time.
Adolescents receive many conflicting messages about sexuality. Boys may be
under pressure to prove their manhood, and possibly to be sexually active beforethey feel ready for it. Likewise, the intense sex drive of the adolescent male alongwith their concern with promoting a masculine identity may lead to irresponsibleand dangerous sexual behavior, or behavior that is inadequately sensitive to theneeds of the partner. Girls, in particular, face conflicting sexual messages. There ispressure to engage in sexual activity in order to “be cool,” to maintain male atten-
198Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 198tion, or to prove that one is not a child. There is also pressure to avoid being
labeled as promiscuous.
Despite many changes in sex roles over the past few decades, the sexually promis-
cuous female is often still stigmatized. Alternatively, adolescents may feel ready toengage in sexual behavior but face restrictions on their behavior from parents, peers,or culture. Sexual mores for adolescents have undergone many changes in recentdecades. Because of this cultural flux, sexual development in adolescents can presentmany challenges. Adolescents benefit most from careful, thoughtful, and open discus-sion with adults about the risks and rewards of sexual activity.
Why are adolescents so reckless?
Adolescents are known for a level of recklessness and disregard of danger not found at anyother age. They drive cars at fast speeds, drive while intoxicated, imbibe massive amountsof alcohol or illicit drugs, break laws, get into fights, have unsafe sex, and engage in manyother high-risk behaviors. As the saying goes, adolescents seem to believe they areimmortal. While this phenomenon is well recognized, it is not fully understood. Probablyseveral factors contribute. For one, the myelination of the frontal lobe is not completeuntil the mid-twenties. Thus, the parts of the brain responsible for impulse control andthe consideration of consequences are not fully developed. Further, the surge of testos-terone, particularly in males, probably increases thrill-seeking behavior.
There is evidence that the emotional parts of the brain are more reactive as well.
The combination of increased thrill seeking with inadequate impulse control can be acombustible mix. Social factors also come into play. The heightened emphasis on peerapproval in adolescence, along with the desire to establish independence fromparental authority, encourages adolescents to forcefully and publicly assert their inde-pendence. Caution and self-control can thus become a sign of childish dependency, apotential source of great embarrassment, and a target for peer ridicule. Commonsense can become “uncool.”
Does culture influence our understanding of adolescence?
Although there are many biological influences on adolescent psychology, adolescencedoes not take place in a cultural vacuum. The very concept of adolescence is a relative-ly recent one. Earlier in our history, there was less recognition of a transitional periodbetween childhood and adulthood. Marriage, childbearing, and occupational maturitytook place during the teen years. Although there was recognition of the special char-acteristics of “youth” (a period extending roughly from adolescence into early adult-hood), most people took on an adult role within their society in their teens. As oursociety has become more complex, more and more time is needed to prepare for adultparticipation in society. Consequently, adolescence has come to be seen as uniqueperiod to be distinguished from both childhood and adulthood.

EARLY ADULTHOOD (19–40)
What are the psychological challenges of early adulthood?
Early adulthood is a less tumultuous period than adolescence. Nonetheless, it has itsown share of challenges and gratifications. At this point, the individual is clearly anadult. He or she is biologically, cognitively, and socially prepared to take on an adultrole within society. This movement toward greater independence and responsibilityentails several steps. Young adults must achieve some degree of emotional and finan-cial individuation from parents. This does not mean that they need to cut ties withtheir parents, only that the nature of their relationship should change from that ofdependency to greater equality.
Young adults need to achieve some degree of financial independence. Many young
adults are still in school, even in their mid to late twenties, and thus are hamperedfrom earning a full living. Nonetheless, they are working toward financial indepen-dence and often have an independent source of income, even if they cannot work fulltime. Additionally, they should be learning to budget, pay bills, pay taxes, and other-wise handle their money independently.
This is also a time of embarking on new intimate attachments. Long-term roman-
tic relationships are established, and most people get married during this period.Many people also become parents in early adulthood, and thus undertake enormousresponsibility for the lives and development of their dependent children.
Finally, this is a time of establishing a career path. Although social roles in West-
ern society have become much more flexible in recent decades and young adults typi-cally make multiple changes in their work and romantic life, choices still need to bemade that have far-reaching consequences. For example, the choice to marry and havechildren with a particular partner will have lifelong implications, even if the marriageends in divorce. Likewise, the choice to pursue higher education or a particular careerpath has extensive influence on later life.
What does separating from parents entail?
The separation from parents is a focal aspect of early adulthood. This may take differ-ent forms in different cultures and subcultures. In cultures that emphasize indepen-dence and self sufficiency, there may be less contact with parents and less dependence
201PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPANHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 201on them for advice, guidance and determination of values and beliefs. In cultures that
emphasize family ties and traditional relationships, there is less expectation of physi-cal separation and greater respect for parental opinions.
However, in any culture, a young adult is expected to engage with parents on a
more egalitarian basis. Young adults must take on more responsibility for the supportof themselves and others, and they are more capable of independent decisions. In West-ern society, young adults are expected to differentiate their own desires, beliefs, values,and goals from those of their parents. Often this is a complicated process, as manyparental attitudes are not explicit and have been unconsciously absorbed over time.
Young adults adjust best when they can maintain close relationships with parents
but also retain the ability to evaluate parental opinions critically but fairly, acceptingwhat is helpful and disregarding what is not. Ultimately, an important psychologicaltask of this period is to achieve an understanding of parents as three-dimensionalhumans, limited and flawed but precious for their unconditional love.
What does it entail to embark on an occupational role ?
One of the cardinal features of young adulthood is the assumption of adult responsi-bilities within society. In modern Western society, this generally involves taking on arole in the work force, deciding on and embarking upon an occupational path. At ear-lier points in history, there was little choice in one’s occupation. Men often did whattheir fathers did and women got married and raised children.
In modern industrialized societies, however, this is no longer true. For most members
of society, there is a smorgasbord of occupational choices, and young adults can often feelbewildered by the sheer number of options. One’s choice of occupation has far-reachingimplications for one’s personal identity, social role, financial well-being, and general quali-ty of life. Unfortunately, there is little definitive information upon which to make suchimportant decisions. Consequently, young adults make choices based on stereotyped viewsof success and career gratification, with little life experience of their own to guide them.The perceived number of options is also a function of education and social class.
Not all adolescents will feel that high-status and high-income professions are
available for them. Nonetheless, the choice to complete high school and even to entersome form of post-secondary education is possible for many members of Western soci-ety. Thus, across socioeconomic groups, young adults must grapple with the task ofchoosing an occupational path.
What specific challenges are involved with the beginning of committed
romantic partnerships?
Although the average age of marriage has increased in the West over the last fewdecades, this is still a time where the majority of people commit to romantic partner-
202Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 202ships. Commitment to marriage or other forms of long-term romantic relationships
brings a host of challenges. The very act of commitment is often an ambivalent one,especially for young adults who have grown used to freedom and independence. Thesame social changes that have demanded longer and longer periods of preparation foradulthood have stretched out the period when a young person has no one to account tobesides himself or herself. Thus, the necessary compromises and sacrifices of commit-ment can present considerable problems. Moreover, even in those people eager to find acommitted relationship, it often takes time and experience to identify those traits in apotential partner that are most important to sustain a long-term relationship.
Many young people complain of being single but continue to pursue lovers who
offer little potential for a successful relationship. Once a committed relationship isattained, there are numerous relationship skills that need to be developed. Couplesneed to learn how to balance alone and together time, communicate needs effectively,and manage conflict constructively. In our constantly changing society, however,there are few fixed rules for relationships, making it more difficult for the young adultto master the skills necessary for a successful relationship. The difficulty of these tasksis reflected in the divorce rate. According to 2005 statistics from the U.S. Center forDisease Control, about 7.5 out of every 1000 people get married each year and about3.6 out of every 1,000 people get divorced. While this is the lowest divorce rate since1970, it is still remarkably high. Likewise, people who marry very young, specificallybefore the age of twenty-three, have the highest likelihood of divorce.
What are the challenges of becoming a parent in early adulthood?
The transition to parenthood demands one of the largest psychological transforma-tions in adulthood. Although young adults may be living entirely independently, withan established career and a mature set of social relationships, they may still think ofthemselves as “a kid” and not “a real adult.” When a person becomes a parent, thisillusion is shattered. A small, helpless baby is utterly dependent on the new parent andthere is no more hiding from the reality of adult responsibilities. Most people findthat, for the first time in their lives, their responsibility to another person is as great,or greater, than their responsibility to themselves. While this level of self-sacrifice canbe very stressful for new parents, especially very young ones, many experience it as anopportunity for tremendous growth and maturity. It can be life enhancing to be lessself-centered. However, as with most aspects of early adult development, our changingculture has taken away clear guidelines.
Although many parents happily take advantage of the flood of available books and
articles on parenting, new parents face inevitable uncertainty when making decisionsabout how to raise their children. At the same time, many new parents renegotiatetheir relationship with their own parents, gaining new appreciation for their knowl-edge and experience. Families tend to get closer when a new baby arrives as grandpar-ents become involved with the new family, often helping out with childcare.
203PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPANHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 203What happens if these challenges are not met?
The transition out of adolescence into young adulthood presents challenges on a
number of levels. Young people must establish a multi-faceted adult identity, committo deeper and more mature relationships, and take on financial, emotional, and socialresponsibilities. In so doing, the young adult opens up opportunities for great satisfac-tion and fulfillment, for greater control and empowerment, and for improved socialstatus and respect. However, each of these developments entails sacrifices. In effect,growing up means giving up: the security of depending on parents, the freedom of alife without commitment and responsibility, and the illusion that it is possible to avoidfailure. These present real psychological challenges and few young adults progresssmoothly along each line of development.
It is normal to have some spottiness across different developmental lines. Howev-
er, it is far more problematic if there is little movement across any area of develop-ment. In this case, young adults may become progressively more depressed as the dis-tance between themselves and their peers becomes more and more apparent withtime. In fact, popular culture has addressed this issue through movies such as RealityBites and Clerks, both of which came out in 1994. In both these movies, young adults
idle aimlessly, frustrated with their lack of forward momentum, but unable to acceptthe inevitable compromises necessitated by an adult role in society.
What is the social clock?
The social clock is a term introduced by a psychologist named Bernice Neugarten. Thisrefers to age-based expectations about when certain life goals should be achieved. Thesemight include the age of marriage, bearing children, attaining a first job, buying ahouse, and/or completing education. Although the settings for a social clock will varyacross cultures, Neugarten suggests that all cultures have some form of age-basedexpectations of task performance. Adults who perceive themselves to be falling behindthe social clock can suffer painful blows to their self-esteem. In our current culture, inwhich social mores are in a constant state of flux, the realities of daily life may notmatch the social clock. For example, many women expect to marry and have children ona timescale similar to that of their mothers. However, as the proportion of never-marriedadults aged thirty to thirty-four is six times greater than it was in 1970, it is likely thesesocial clocks may need to be reset. In fact, according to the 2007 U.S. census report, theproportion of never-married people aged thirty to thirty-four was over 28 percent.
Who was Daniel Levinson?
Daniel Levinson (1920–1994) was one of the first psychologists after Erikson to devel-op a theory of adult development. In 1978, he published a book called Seasons of a
Man’s Life, which was based on extensive interviews with men in several differentoccupations. In 1987 he published a book entitled Seasons in a Woman’s Life, using
204Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 204similar methodology with a sample of women. Even though his samples were small
and largely limited to upper-income people, his thoughts about adult development areworth considering.
What is Daniel Levinson’s theory of adult development ?
Levinson proposed that adult development goes through a series of predictable stages,known as seasons or eras. These include: early adulthood (age twenty-two to forty),
middle adulthood (age forty to sixty) and late adulthood (age sixty and up). He also pro-posed the notion of cross-era transitions, in which the adult negotiates the psychologi-cal challenges of transitioning from one stage to another. Cross-era transitions lastabout five to seven years. Levinson suggests that the first stage, early adulthood, ischaracterized by the creation of the initial life structure . This is a period of great excite-
ment and satisfaction, but also of notable uncertainty and anxiety. To Levinson, adultdevelopment involves a series of fluctuations between the creation and rearrangementof life structures. A life structure refers to the entire design of a person’s life, includingpsychological traits, social relationships, and work life. A life structure is most satisfy-ing when personal needs can be harmonized with external societal demands.
What did Levinson say about early adulthood?
In the novice phase of early adulthood (roughly age seventeen to thirty-three), the youngadult is creating the initial life structure. This is a very difficult task for people with so lit-tle life experience, and choices are based more on a dream of what life should be than on
205PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPAN
Why is college graduation so traumatic for some young adults?
College graduation marks an abrupt transition between adolescence and youngadulthood. Particularly for those students who attend residential, four-year
colleges, the end of the relatively sheltered and structured college experience canbe quite disorienting. In general, the transition between adolescence and adult-hood can be anxiety-provoking. People at this stage of life often feel considerableanxiety about taking on the risks and responsibilities of creating an adult lifestructure. Fear of failure or of being trapped in a dead-end or soul-crushingcareer can feed a desire to prolong the carefree, aimless days of adolescence.
Two popular American movies that came out in the 1990s address the emo-
tional difficulties some young adults have in making the transition from adoles-cence to early adulthood. Clerks, starring Brian O’Halloran and Jeff Anderson,
and Reality Bites, starring Winona Ryder, Ethan Hawke, Janeane Garofolo, and
Ben Stiller, both play with the humor and pathos of this stage of life.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 205personal experience. At the age thirty transition, people have the opportunity to evaluate
their life as lived so far. For the first time in their life, they have a past as an adult as wellas a future. They can compare their actual experiences with their original life dream, andconsider what part of their life structure needs to be revised. In the culminating phase(33 to 45), the initial life structure is brought to fruition. The adult experiences both thegratifications and the disappointments in life as it has turned out to be. This era endswhen the adult transitions into the next major life era, middle adulthood.
Which of Eric Erickson’s psychosexual stages pertain to early adulthood?
Erik Erikson suggested that young adulthood was a time when people struggled withintimacy vs. isolation. He believed that this stage depended upon a successful resolu-tion of the previous stage, identity vs. isolation. Erikson believed that it is necessary tohave a stable personal identity, a secure sense of self, in order to establish a commit-ted, intimate relationship. In an intimate partnership, one has to open up one’s identi-ty to another person. To some extent, intimacy involves the merger of one’s sense ofself with that of the other person. If a secure sense of self has not been achieved, itremains too threatening to loosen the reins and let another person in. When peopleare afraid of losing themselves in a relationship, intimacy and commitment will beavoided. Such people may engage in many short-term relationships or avoid monoga-mous relationships. Interestingly, later research has supported Erikson’s ideas. Peoplewho are more secure in their values and goals are more likely to remain faithful inintimate relationships and to be more ready for a serious commitment.
What are the developmental tasks of early adulthood according to
Roger Gould?
Roger Gould (1935–) is a psychoanalytic writer who has written a good deal aboutadult development. In fact, the popular book Passages by Gail Sheehy was based heav-
ily on his research. Like Levinson, Gould conceptualized adult development as unfold-ing in a series of predictable stages. Gould was particularly interested in the wayadults understand their life choices and how that changes across the lifespan. Gouldproposed that the early adult years (age eighteen to thirty-five) were characterized byseveral psychological illusions that are slowly relinquished over time. He was particu-larly interested in the illusion of absolute safety.
One of the cardinal experiences of all human beings involves the fear of death. Our
drive is toward life and we are terrified at the prospect of the annihilation of life, ofdeath. In childhood, the illusion of absolute safety is maintained through dependence onidealized parents who are seen as omnipotent protectors, all-powerful guardians againstdeath. In early adulthood, the illusion of absolute safety is transferred to the fantasy ofthe one right path. This path will lead to “the prize,” to absolute safety. Young adultsanxiously and desperately seek this one true path, ever fearful of making a mistake, of
206Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 206going down the wrong path. It is only in midlife, when mortality becomes an emotional
as well as an intellectual reality, that the illusion of the one right way can be abandoned.
MIDDLE ADULTHOOD (40–60)
What are the overall themes of middle adulthood?
In all of the previous life stages, the individual is moving toward maturity. In middleadulthood, the adult has reached maturity. The adult is fully a grown up. At this stagein life however, middle-aged adults must confront the beginnings of physical decline.There is still considerable vigor and vitality in middle adulthood as well as consider-able potential for psychological growth. Nonetheless, the signs of a declining body areunavoidable. Middle-aged adults confront a loss of physical strength and energy,minor aches and pains that occur more easily and take longer to go away than everbefore, and various losses in sensory and cognitive abilities. There are significant con-solations to middle adulthood, however. Decades of life experience promote generalwisdom, the capacity to understand the world as a whole, integrated system. There isgreater emotional maturity as well, an understanding of one’s self and others in moretempered and thoughtful ways. In middle adulthood, we are older but wiser.
What kind of physical changes occur in middle adulthood ?
While middle-aged adults retain the physical abilities necessary to conduct their dailylives, there are unmistakable signs of aging. There is a loss of lean body mass, includ-ing both muscle and bone, and a concomitant gain in body fat. On average, women’sabdomens increase by about thirty percent and men’s by about ten percent from earlyto middle adulthood. There are also changes in the layers of the skin, such that elas-ticity is lost, the skin loosens and wrinkles form. Gray hair is caused by a reduction ofmelanin in the hair follicles.
There are also important changes in the reproductive system, especially for women.
Menopause occurs on average at age fifty-one but most women experience considerablehormonal changes for several years before. These changes affect sleep, temperature reg-ulation, bone density, and sexual function. It is important to note that physical health inmiddle adulthood is strongly influenced by health-related behaviors. A healthy diet (i.e.,one rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins), regular exercise, andavoidance of smoking and excessive alcohol can greatly moderate the effects of aging.
What sensory changes occur in middle adulthood ?
Presbyopia, which means “old eyes” in Greek, refers to a common condition encoun-tered in middle adulthood. The lens of the eye becomes less flexible, reducing the abil-
207PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPANHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 207ity of the eye to focus on close objects. People in their forties frequently have difficulty
reading due to presbyopia. They must hold reading material at arm’s length to focuson the letters. Consequently, many people this age buy reading glasses for the firsttime. There are also changes in hearing, although these are not as noticeable as thechanges in vision. Loss of sensitivity to high-pitched sounds can begin in middleadulthood although hearing loss is generally more pronounced in later adulthood.
How does cognition change in midlife?
When discussing cognition in midlife, it is important to distinguish between fluid vs.crystallized intelligence. Fluid intelligence refers to raw processing power, specifically
aspects of attention, memory, and processing speed. Crystallized intelligence refers to
learned skills, including funds of information, verbal knowledge, and knowledge ofsocial conventions. Fluid intelligence declines in midlife. The raw ability to processnew information slows down. Consider the ease in which a teenager or young adultlearns new technology compared to the difficulties middle-aged adults often face mas-tering the same task. On the other hand, crystallized intelligence increases steadilythroughout middle adulthood. In fact, aspects of complex reasoning, verbal ability,and spatial processing peak in middle adulthood and only slowly decline thereafter.
In what ways does cognition improve in midlife?
While the speed of information processing slows down considerably, this loss is madeup for by a much greater understanding of the world in general. Adolescents andyounger adults can process isolated bits of information more efficiently than olderadults, but they have little context with which to understand it. Older adults have aricher, broader, and more integrated understanding of the world at large. Moreover,the ability to recognize how events can fit into familiar patterns can help compensatefor the loss of fluid processing skills. For example, if a chess master can recognizefamiliar configurations of chess pieces, there is less need to memorize the positions ofeach chess piece on the board.
What emotional changes transpire in middle adulthood ?
There is a universally recognized trend in middle adulthood to be calmer, less impul-sive, and less emotionally reactive than at younger ages. Middle-aged adults often feelstress, due to the numerous responsibilities they face, but they are relatively free of theexistential angst that characterizes earlier periods. Their greater understanding of theworld as a whole allows them to put events into perspective. When you can take thelong view of a situation, it tends to take the sting out of any particular incident. Thisreduces emotional volatility. Moreover, middle-aged adults have a larger world view,which allows them to better understand the implications of any given event, to appreci-ate the possible consequences. This consideration of consequences tempers impulsivity.
208Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 208What impact does mortality play in middle adulthood?
A critical aspect of psychological development in midlife involves a change in the rela-
tionship with death. As several theorists have noted, in adolescence and early adult-hood, mortality is often theoretical at best. Adolescents are known for their illusionsof immortality, resulting at times in a reckless disregard for danger. In early adult-hood, death is recognized in the abstract. While young adults do not believe they areimmortal, neither does death feel entirely real.
In middle adulthood, death becomes much more real. Many people of the prior
generation die: parents, aunts and uncles, older friends and colleagues, and the par-ents of friends. Some people of the adult’s own generation die as well. In the context ofthese direct encounters with mortality, death can no longer remain an abstraction.
In some people, the confrontation with mortality in midlife can lead to panic and
a frantic denial of aging and death. More optimally, it can lead to greater perspective ofwhat really matters in life and a realignment of priorities. Of note, this discussionapplies to people in modern Western societies, who remain largely shielded fromdeath prior to midlife. In societies where early death is more prevalent, however, it islikely that mortality is experienced quite differently.
How does the view of one’s options in life change during this period?
In early adulthood, we have a sense of open horizons. Regardless of what is happeningin the present, goals and ideals can still be reached in the future. There will always be
209PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPAN
Why does time seem to speed up as we age?
One of the dramatic experiences of middle adulthood involves the change inthe subjective sense of time. To a small child, an hour seems like an eternity.
The future does not exist. By early adulthood, time has sped up considerablyfrom early childhood but the young adult still experiences time as relatively stat-ic. While the future exists in theory, only the present feels real.
In contrast, by mid-life every year is a much smaller fraction of the adult’s
entire life span. Time seems to flow faster and faster, almost as if the person iswalking on a moving sidewalk and the surrounding landscape is speeding upwith every step. Because of this, middle aged adults have a less static sense oftime. They experience themselves and their world in a sense of flux. The presentis a moving target and the future is just around the bend. Likewise, middle agedadults are often surprised by the speed that the present retreats into the past.“That was twenty years ago? Already?” “These clothes are out of style? But I justbought them!”Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 209time to get married, have children, or start a career. In midlife, the adult confronts the
narrowing of options. Time is limited. Life’s possibilities are finite. Even though it maybe possible to change tracks, it may not be worth the cost in time, money, or sheerenergy. And some opportunities are simply closed. A woman cannot give birth aftermenopause. For some people, there might be feelings of being trapped. For others,there may be anger and disappointment at lost opportunities. Optimally, the con-frontation with limitations in one’s life promotes greater psychological maturity. Diffi-cult decisions must be made, disappointments must be accepted, and priorities mustbe realigned to make the best of life as it is, not as we think it should be.
How does the view of the self change in middle adulthood?
In midlife, the sense of self is much more defined than it was in earlier periods. A gooddeal of life has already been lived, and the unfolding of that life has cemented the adult’ssense of who they are, where they have been, and where they are likely to go. Because ofthis, middle-aged adults are likely to have a greater sense of self assurance than are ado-lescents and younger adults. To the extent the adult has had experiences of success, ofmastering challenges, and accomplishing goals, there are gains in self-confidence.
In midlife, one also has to confront one’s own limitations. The dreams of youth
must be reconciled with the reality of life as lived. To the extent that the discrepanciesbetween ideals and reality can be accepted, there is greater self-acceptance and morestable self-esteem. There can be a sense of liberty from the tyranny of youthful expec-tations. However, for those who cannot accept that life does not always turn out theway we want, there can be considerable depression along with a great sense of anger,frustration, and shame.
How is middle adulthood often a time of peak responsibilities?
Midlife is frequently a time of peak responsibilities, both at home and in the work-place. Adults at this stage of life often have ongoing parenting responsibilities withchildren still living at home. At the same time, their parents are aging and frequentlyneed care. Due to their greater experience and psychological maturity, middle-agedadults are ideally positioned to assume greater responsibility in the workplace. Manymove into positions of management at work. Assumption of such supervisory rolesbrings to mind Erikson’s stage of Generativity vs. Stagnation, the psychosocial stage ofmiddle adulthood. In Erikson’s view, generativity involves providing care and guid-ance for the next generation and for society as a whole.
What are the typical challenges of parenting during middle adulthood?
In early adulthood the challenges of parenting typically involve taking on the enor-mous responsibility of day-to-day care of a children. In middle adulthood, however,
210Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 210the parent will need to learn how to let go. If the children are adolescents, the parent
will need to offer some supervision to the child, but also allow them a good degree offreedom from parental control. Finding the right balance is a difficult challenge asmany adolescents are prone to recklessness and their judgment is far from mature.Allowing their children greater independence can also be a loss for parents, who havedevoted more than a decade to the task of child rearing. Parents in midlife need to findareas of fulfillment in their life that are independent of their parenting role. This is toensure that the parent’s dependence on the parental role does not interfere with thechild’s developmental need for greater independence.
What changes take place in the relationships between middle-aged adults and
their parents?
The vast majority of adults in middle adulthood will experience the aging and evendeath of their parents. As their parents’ physical and cognitive abilities deteriorate,adult children must take on a caretaking role. The extent to which the children takeon such responsibilities will vary from family to family but some degree of role rever-sal between parent and adult child is largely unavoidable. The financial, medical, andsupervisory aspects of elder care can be extremely complex, particularly in modern,industrialized societies in which both women and men work outside the home.
211PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPAN
One of the cardinal challenges of middle adulthood involves the confrontation with mortality and the loss of the youthful body.
Changes in modern technology, such as plastic surgery, collagen injections, and Botox injections, can prolong physical beauty. Over-
dependence on such techniques, however, can promote a denial of aging. This in turn undermines the psychological maturity deriv ed
from acknowledgment and acceptance of the inevitable limits in life ( iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 211Psychologically, the role reversal between elderly parent and middle-aged child
can be difficult. Besides the obvious stress of the new responsibilities, there is a sense
of sadness at the loss of the parental figure. Even though the middle-aged adult is fullymature and handles significant responsibilities, it is still upsetting to realize there areno more “grown-ups” to fall back upon. It is the children who are the grown-ups now,not the parents.
What does Roger Gould say about middle adulthood?
In Gould’s view, the confrontation with aging and mortality in midlife punctures theIllusion of Absolute Safety. This demands a renegotiation of the adult’s relationshipwith work, marriage, family, and many other aspects of life. With regard to work, peo-ple who have dedicated their lives to the pursuit of success realize that even when suchgoals are accomplished, they fail to bring the “prize” dreamt of at an earlier period.Fame, power, and wealth cannot confer immortality. A restlessness and dissatisfactioncan occur, to be resolved only when the motivation for work comes from pleasure inthe task rather than the expectation of magical transformation and ultimate salvation.
When Gould was writing in the 1970s, this dynamic mainly applied to men (and
affluent men at that). In women, the illusion of absolute safety was more likely to mani-fest in a sense of self as helplessly dependent on a man. Although many women felttrapped by their lack of autonomy, the acceptance of greater self-determination was anx-iety-provoking. It stripped away the comforting illusion of the male as the omnipotentprotector. No matter how people cling to the illusion of absolute safety, the desire to pro-tect oneself from awareness of death inevitably brings great psychological costs.Remaining ignorant of a disturbing reality forces people to constrict their own self-expe-rience, impoverishing their personality. Fortunately, midlife provides an opportunity forpeople to enhance their psychological potential by shedding their denial of mortality.
LATER ADULTHOOD (60 AND OLDER)
What physiological changes occur in later adulthood?
The physiological changes that began in middle adulthood intensify in late adulthood.Primarily a nuisance in middle adulthood, they begin to truly interfere with everydayfunctioning in late life. But it is important to distinguish between different stages ofthis last phase of life. Gerontologists, people who study aging, speak of the young-oldand the old-old, meaning those in their sixties and early seventies and those over theage of seventy-five. Some also speak of the oldest old, those over eighty-five. Theyoung-old, by and large, are still very vigorous. In the older age group, however, thedecline in body functions can significantly constrict life activities.
212Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 212What kind of bodily changes occur in late life? There is some belief that aging
starts in the cells. There is decreased cell regeneration and deterioration in cell DNA
and RNA. Brain cells also deteriorate, with decreased neurogenesis (new neurongrowth) and general shrinkage of brain tissue. There is musculoskeletal deterioration,with continued loss of muscle mass and bone density. Thickening of the lens of the eyecontinues to reduce vision. Hearing, in particular, takes a hit, with 65 percent of peo-ple age eighty or above showing an inability to hear high-pitched sounds. Difficultiesmaking sense of conversation can leave the elderly feeling socially isolated.
Additional changes take place in the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, respiratory,
and endocrine systems. Chronic diseases become much more common at this stage inlife, particularly diabetes, hypertension, and arthritis. The news is not all bad, howev-er. There are many lifestyle factors over which people have considerable control thatcan maximize health and well-being. Perhaps even to a greater extent than at youngerages, exercise, diet, positive mood, stimulating mental activities, and positive socialrelationships can promote optimal functioning.
What are the psychological challenges of later adulthood?
Late adulthood, which can last up to thirty years (and beyond in some cases), is thelast stage of life. Although this stage can cover many years, it still marks the closing ofthe life story. Adults at this stage must review their life as lived and come to some sortof emotional closure about how their life has unfolded. Adults in late life must alsoconfront the unavoidable reality of mortality and hopefully come to accept theinevitability of death. People in this stage cope with numerous losses: physical vigorand sometimes health, roles and responsibilities of an earlier age, and loved ones whohave died.
Luckily, older adults are often well-equipped emotionally to handle these daunt-
ing psychological challenges. Many studies show that psychological maturity contin-ues to grow across the lifespan. In general, adults in late life have a more positive out-look, are less prone to negative emotional reactions, and are less egocentric thanyounger people. The storied wisdom of the old is both a function of life experience anda buffer against life experience.
Is depression more common in later life than at younger ages?
Depression is actually less common in later life than at younger ages but is arguablymore debilitating when it does occur. Adults in late life incur a significant amount oflosses, including their job, health, and status and role in society. They also suffer thedeath of loved ones. Such losses can certainly precipitate depression. Additionally,medical conditions that are more frequent in late life, such as stroke and dementia,can cause depressive symptoms. The nature of geriatric depression is somewhat differ-ent from that found in younger people.
213PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPANHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 213Elderly people often express their depression through somatic complaints (com-
plaints about physical problems) and frequently have sleep problems and markedly
reduced energy, initiative, and appetite. Sometimes there is considerable weight loss.The resulting self-neglect can put the elderly depressed person in real danger. Like-wise, suicide is a serious problem. In fact, the risk of suicide is five times higher inwhite men over the age of sixty-five than in the general population. Nonetheless,despite their exposure to multiple losses, in general, the elderly have a lower rate ofdepression than do younger groups. This has been attributed to the greater emotionregulation and coping skills of older adults.
What are the benefits of getting older?
Provided there is adequate financial, medical, and social support, adults in late life canbenefit from both a reduction in stressful responsibilities and ongoing gains in psy-chological maturity. Many researchers talk of wisdom, which is loosely defined as bet-ter emotional regulation, judgment, understanding of the ways of the world, andempathy for others. With increasing age, there is generally a reduction in impulsive,impetuous behavior and emotional volatility along with an improved ability to seethings from others’ perspectives. In many cultures, the elderly are valued for theirwise advice. If the older adult is in relatively good health, particularly in the earlierstages of late adulthood, there is enhanced opportunity for enjoyable leisure activities.
What do the theorists of adult development say about this period?
Erikson described the psychological challenge of the last stage of life as Ego Integrity vs.Despair. By this he meant that adults at this stage are facing the end of their life. Manydecisions have been made, life has been largely lived, and it has brought both disappoint-ments and rewards. When people can see their life as a whole and accept both its disap-pointments and gratifications as part of a complete narrative, then they can achieve egointegrity. When older adults cannot accept their disappointments and thwarted dreams,they fall into despair. Life will soon be over and there are no more chances.
Erikson’s wife, Joan, later wrote about an additional stage for the very old, which
she termed gerotranscendance. In this stage, in the ninth or tenth decade of life, peo-
ple begin to look beyond their own individual lifespan. Very close to their own death,they start to transcend their identity as a single, isolated person and begin to seethemselves as part of a larger whole that will live on after their own death. According-ly, research has shown that older adults are more involved in religious activities thanare younger people. Several other theorists, such as Heinz Kohut, Daniel Levinson,and Bernice Neugarten, also write about the need in late life to come to terms withboth the positive and negative aspects of one’s life as lived as well as the losses ofaging, the diminished role of the self, and the impending end of life.
214Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 214What is the psychological impact of retirement ?
Sixty-five is the traditional age of retirement. For those who have spent the majority
of their waking hours at work over the previous four decades, this is an enormoustransition. For some people—particularly those who have not cultivated interests orsocial relationships outside of work—retirement represents a significant loss, andthere can be difficulties with emotional adjustment. For others, retirement offers theopportunity to explore new interests and old passions, spend more time with friendsand family, and give back to the community through volunteer work or socially mean-ingful part-time work. The extent to which people plan out a new life structure inadvance influences their adjustment to retirement. Of course, much also depends onthe financial resources and physical health of the retired adult, which in turn dependson social policies regarding retirement financing and healthcare.
Across developed countries the average lifespan has lengthened considerably. Pro-
jections show that the proportion of the population that is above sixty-five and eighty-five will grow tremendously in the decades to come. For example, according to U.S.census data, in 1900 people aged sixty-five and older comprised four percent of thepopulation while those aged eighty-five and over comprised only 0.1 percent of thepopulation. By 2050, these rates are projected to be 20 percent and 4.8 percent,respectively. This raises concerns about the ability of governments or corporations tofund retirement pensions. Lessening that concern are the same factors that accountfor the increased lifespan in the first place.
The advances in medical technology, nutrition, and lifestyle that have increased
longevity also increase the vigor and productivity of seniors, particularly the “young-old” in their sixties and early seventies. In fact, many people reenter the work forcesoon after retirement, in volunteer or part-time positions, if not full-time jobs.
How does the relationship with mortality change in this phase of life?
While mortality becomes real in middle adulthood, it becomes immediate in lateadulthood. Middle-aged adults deal with the death of their parents and other people intheir parents’ generation. Elderly adults deal with the death of people in their owngeneration, their spouses, siblings, and longtime friends. While middle-aged adultsconfront the reality of future death, adults in late life recognize their own death maybe coming soon. Of course, the period of late life plays into this. Healthy adults intheir mid-sixties can expect to live into their eighties (eighty-one for males andeighty-six for females according to the U.S. Census Bureau), while people in theirninth and tenth decade of life are looking at a much shorter time horizon.
What factors contribute to a positive adjustment to later adulthood?
A number of factors contribute to a positive adjustment to late adulthood, many ofwhich serve a similar function at earlier stages of adulthood. For one, social support
215PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPANHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 215retains its critical importance. Although the size of people’s social circles tends to
decrease with age, and many older adults spend less time with acquaintances in favorof family and close friends, the quality of social relationships has a powerful impact onthe sense of well-being. Secondly, engagement in meaningful and satisfying activities,such as hobbies, creative work, volunteer work, or even part-time jobs, are crucialsources of satisfaction for adults in late life.
Involvement in productive work of some kind enhances self-esteem and a sense of
belonging. Particularly after retirement, it is important to have some form of struc-tured and meaningful activity with which to replace the purpose, structure, and iden-tity formerly derived from the work role. Finally, physical exercise is tremendouslybeneficial. Even thirty minutes a day of walking can have clear, measurable benefits.Physical exercise promotes cardiovascular health, muscle strength, and bone density.This gives older adults mobility and functional independence, which has a strongimpact on life satisfaction.
Further, improved cardio-vascular health protects brain function and cognition.
There is considerable evidence that physical exercise is protective against dementia. Infact, exercise has been shown to increase the amount of a chemical called brain-derived
neurotropic factor (BDNF), which in turn promotes the growth of new brain cells.
How does the role of older adults vary across cultures and historical
time periods?
In many traditional cultures, the elderly are highly esteemed members of the commu-nity. Their advice is sought in many matters and valued for its wisdom. People live inlarge, extended families and grandparents often contribute to the care of grandchil-dren. When people grow too old to take care of themselves, younger family members(mostly women) provide care. In most modern, industrialized societies, however,there has been a dramatic change in the structure of the family. To a large extent, the
216How has aging in America changed in recent years?
One way that today’s elderly have adapted to the profound social changes ofthe past several decades has been to increasingly engage in activities previ-
ously associated with younger age groups. Advances in medical technology haveincreased the health and physical strength of older people, making such endeav-ors possible. Exercise classes for senior citizens, continuing education for retiredpeople, volunteer jobs for older people, and even elder hostels for adults in latelife who want to travel, have all grown to meet this change in the social role ofadults in late life.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 216nuclear family has replaced the extended family. People are more mobile, move resi-
dences more often, and adult children can live hundreds if not thousands of milesaway from their parents. Further, working women do not have the time to providefull-time care for aging parents.
Thus, the place of the elderly in society has undergone great disruption. Two
movements have emerged in response to these changes. For one, there has beengrowth of government-sponsored elder care services, including nursing homes, adulthomes, home health aides, and adult day care centers. Secondly, there has been anextension of activities previously associated with earlier periods of life, such as travel,sports, continuing education, and paid or unpaid work, far into late life. Seniorstoday are likely to be more active—physically, economically, and socially—than theirparents were.
How does cognition change in late life?
As with middle adulthood, fluid intelligence (processing speed, working memory,complex attention) continues to decline. Crystallized intelligence (fund of informa-tion, verbal skills, vocabulary) remains intact for much longer. This relates to thegrowth of wisdom discussed above. Eventually, perhaps in the ninth or tenth decade oflife, crystallized intelligence also starts to decline. Although we do expect some intel-lectual decline with normal aging, severe intellectual decline is not a part of normalaging, but rather a symptom of dementia.
What is dementia?
Dementia involves the loss of intellectual abilities, generally including memory, spa-tial skills, and executive functions (planning, abstract thought, self-monitoring, etc.).The two most common forms of dementia are Alzheimer’s disease and vascular
dementia. The biology of Alzheimer’s is characterized by the buildup of amyloidplaques and neurofibrillary tangles in and around the neuron (brain cell). Alzheimer’s
starts with memory impairment and then generalizes to a broad range of cognitiveimpairments, sufficiently severe to leave people unable to care for themselves. Vascu-lar dementia is caused by cerebrovascular events, such as strokes, which involve
major disruptions of the blood supply to the brain.
Dementia is fairly rare in the mid-sixties (about ten percent) but becomes quite
common by the eighties and nineties. By some estimates, 50 percent of all people over85 have Alzheimer’s disease. Consequently, virtually all families will be touched bydementia at some point. The social implications of this are enormous. People withsevere dementia demand round-the-clock care, which puts tremendous strain on fam-ilies, both emotionally and financially. Given the growing population of elderly peopleacross the industrialized world, significant resources will be needed for elder care inthe coming years.
217PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPANHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 217218What is the nun study?
The nun study is a fascinating examination of aging and Alzheimer’s disease
conducted in a convent for retired nuns in Mankato, Minnesota. Religious
orders make marvelous settings for epidemiological research studies (studies ofhealth and disease patterns in whole populations) because of the relatively uni-form lifestyle found in these environments. With many potentially complicatingvariables held constant, such as smoking, alcohol use, quality of health care, andincome, it is much easier to have confidence in the research results.
David Snowdon, the study’s lead researcher, began the study in 1991 with a
population of 678 nuns. He administered tests of cognitive function and healthstatus. Remarkably, the convent had preserved the essays the nuns wrote uponentering the convent in their teens or early twenties. Finally, the nuns gave theirpermission for their brains to be autopsied after death. This is critical, as theonly way to definitively diagnose Alzheimer’s disease is through brain autopsy.
Although the study is ongoing, several noteworthy findings have already
been published. For one, essays written in the nuns’ adolescence and early adult-hood gave clues as to who was more likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease lateron. The nuns who used more complex grammar and ideas and more positiveemotion words were less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease 60 years later.More educated nuns also had a lower chance of developing Alzheimer’s. Fromthis data alone, however, we cannot distinguish between cause and effect. Do theessays reflect the earliest manifestations of Alzheimer’s or good habits that ulti-mately protect against the disease?
The autopsy data give clues to this $64,000 question. Although the degree of
brain damage due to neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques did correlatewith the degree of cognitive decline, it was not a 100 percent correlation. In otherwords, there were nuns with considerable amounts of brain damage who showedlittle to no dementia. In fact, 58 percent of the nuns with mild and 32 percent ofthose with moderate brain pathology did not show memory impairment.
The researchers concluded that there was something known as cognitive
reserve that protected against functional deterioration in the face of brain dis-
ease. They believed that various factors contributed to cognitive reserve bypromoting richer neuronal networks (or enhanced communication betweenbrain cells) and greater cerebrovascular health. Such factors seem to include
education, positive mood, mental stimulation, and healthy diet (specificallythe vitamin folate). Cerebrovascular health is very important because the pres-ence of strokes dramatically reduced the cognitive performance of nuns withAlzheimer’s disease.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 218THE END OF LIFE: DEATH AND DYING
What is thanatology ?
Thanatology refers to the study of death. Because of a number of societal changes, there
is now more interest in the nature and quality of death and dying, at least in the devel-
oped world. Such changes include the growth of the elderly population, cultural shiftstoward greater openness about distressing topics, and longer intervals from the onset ofterminal illnesses to death. Thanatologists work closely with the health care system toimprove the process of dying both for the dying patient and the surviving family.
What contributes to a “good death”?
A number of studies have examined the factors that influence the quality of the dyingprocess–the factors that contribute to a “good death.” All studies suggest there aremultiple components involved. Probably first and foremost is the issue of physicalpain and discomfort. For both dying patients and their families, it is critically impor-tant that the last days are physically comfortable. In response, the medical disciplineof palliative care has arisen to address the comfort of the terminally ill.
Other domains include the social, psychological, and spiritual realms of experi-
ence, as well as the degree of preparation for death. Social factors pertain to theinvolvement, support, and cohesion of (or, conversely, conflict between) family mem-bers. Psychological factors include a sense of closure regarding life as lived and theawareness and acceptance of death. Ideally, the person will feel relatively at peace atthe time of death. Spiritual needs are particularly acute at this time and religiousbeliefs about life after death or the connection of the individual to the larger wholecan be profoundly comforting. Preparation for death also includes planning inadvance for the medical, legal, and financial issues that are likely to follow.
What role does hope have in the dying process?
Many thanatologists speak of the importance of hope in the dying process. In thebeginning of a life threatening illness, people hope for recovery, to survive the illness,or at least to prolong life. As the reality of death grows closer, it is important to trans-form the nature of hope. The hope of avoiding death can be translated into the hope offinding and achieving a sense of meaning, of reaching the conviction that one’s lifehas had value, and that death will be faced with dignity and integrity.
What are Elizabeth Kübler-Ross’ five stages of grief?
Elizabeth Kübler-Ross (1926–2004) was one of the first thanatologists to publish astage theory about the grieving process. Her work was based on studies of the termi-
219PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFESPANHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 219nally ill. While her model has been criticized, her descriptions of the five stages of
grief are still highly influential and provide a good overview of the variety of emotionalexperiences people undergo while grieving. The five stages of grief are as follows:denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.
The first stage is denial. When people first learn of their terminal illness, they go
into shock and try to deny that it is real. The next stage involves anger. People learningof their own impending death are frequently angry. This anger may be expressed at doc-tors, at family, or even at themselves. It is as though they are looking for a place to puttheir anger at their illness. The next stage involves bargaining. They try to bargain withdoctors, friends, family, and even God. By holding onto the belief that they can changethe outcome of their illness through “good” behavior, they try to maintain a sense ofcontrol. When the reality of death finally sinks in, the result is depression. Ultimately,the person absorbs the intense and devastating shock of their terminal illness. At thispoint, they reach the stage of acceptance, in which they can face death with a degree ofresolution and psychological peace. Later research has shown that not all dyingpatients go through each stage, nor do they go through them in the same sequence.Nonetheless, many people do experience the states of mind that Kübler-Ross describes.
What do other theorists have to say about grief?
Several theorists have followed Kübler-Ross’s work with their own work on theprocess of grieving. In a series of publications from the 1960s to the 1980s, JohnBowlby (the father of attachment theory) collaborated with Colin Murray Parkes tocondense Kübler-Ross’s five stages into four phases of grief. Their work differed fromKübler-Ross’s original work, however, in that their focus was on the bereaved ratherthan the dying.
Their four phases are as follows: Shock and disbelief, searching and yearning, dis-
organization and despair, and rebuilding and healing. Thus, the bereaved must under-go a process of recognizing the loss, experiencing the acute pain of the loss, and thenslowly rebuilding life and relationships so as to continue on without the loved one. J.William Worden developed a similar approach, speaking less of the phases than thetasks of grief. In his view, the bereaved must go through four stages: accept the realityof the loss, work through the pain of grief, adjust to an environment in which thedeceased is missing, and emotionally relocate the deceased and move on with life.Other theorists, such as Robert Neimeyer and Alan Wolfelt, write of related issues,such as the need to rebuild an identity independent of the lost relationship and totransfer the relationship with the deceased out of daily life and into memory.
Is there research on the grief process?
Although there are a fair number of theories about the process of grief, there has beenless in the way of actual scientific data about the normal course of grief. In 2007, Paul
220Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 220Maciejewski and colleagues published a study of 233 bereaved adults conducted over a
twenty-four-month period. They administered measures of yearning, disbelief, anger,depression, and acceptance at three time points in the first two years after the loss.Their results showed that disbelief peaked soon after the death and then consistentlydeclined afterward. Yearning, which was the most pronounced and long lasting of thenegative emotional responses to loss, peaked at about four months. Anger peaked atabout five months, and depression at about six months. Acceptance continuously grewthroughout the mourning period.
Surprisingly, even from the start, acceptance was rated higher than all other grief
reactions. The high levels of acceptance may be explained by the large percentage ofpeople who were over 65 at the time of the loss and whose loved ones died after a longillness. Furthermore, the study only included people whose losses were due to naturalcauses. Presumably, younger people and those whose loved ones died due to unnaturalcauses may have more difficulty with accepting the loss. Although this study may notpertain to all types of losses, it does give a good sense of the typical grief reaction tothe most common kinds of losses.

How do we define love?
What is love? How do we define it? Is love one thing or a set of many things? Are there
different types of love? Is love the same for different types of relationships? Even as farback as the ancient Greeks, people have struggled with the nature of love. Poets havewritten about love perhaps as long as poets have been writing. Psychologists may lackthe eloquence of poets, but through empirical research, we can study the nature oflove systematically. We can observe people in different situations, interview themabout their life experiences, and develop questionnaires to investigate people’s atti-tudes and behaviors. This way, definitions of love are drawn not only from personalopinion, but from scientific investigations.
What do we mean by love?
There are many kinds of love: people can love their cats, their 1957 Chevy, or the smellof the air in early April. For our purposes, we are going to restrict the discussion oflove to an emotional state that one person feels in relationship with another person.
How are factor analyses used in the study of love?
Is love one entity or is it made up of many different parts? One way to explore thestructure of love is through factor analysis. This is an important statistical techniquethat shows how different items group together. It is used to investigate if a single ideais made up of separate sub-categories. Researchers create questionnaires based on aseries of items, words, or scenarios related to love. They then ask research participants

LOVE, MARRIAGE, AND THE BABY CARRIAGEHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 223What arguments were given about
the nature of love at Plato’s symposiums?
In ancient Greece, a symposium
was something like an extended
drinking party, which ofteninvolved speeches and philosophi-cal discussions. Plato’s symposiumdescribed such a dinner party inwhich the famed philosopherSocrates joined several of hisfriends to discuss the nature oflove. Participants discussed lovefrom various angles, includingmedical, humorous, erotic, andspiritual points of view. The comicpoet Aristophanes declared thatpeople were once twice as large asthey are now but were cut in half bythe Gods who saw such beings as athreat. Ever since this time, wehave wandered the earth searchingfor our other half. Socrates statedthat the love of wisdom and truthwas the highest form of love, tran-scending erotic and romantic love.
Socrates felt that love of wisdom and truth was more
important that romantic love (iStock).
224to rate their love relationships using these questionnaires. Through factor analyses,
researchers can then identify clusters of items that intercorrelate (or group together).Do people who score high on item 1 also score high on items 2, 3, and 4? These clus-ters, or factors, can then be labeled as components of love.
Are there different types of love?
Some researchers suggest that there are many types of love. Others suggest one corefeature to love that cuts across different types of relationships. For example, in 1977using factor analysis of 1,500 items related to love, John Lee categorized six majortypes of love: eros (erotic desire for an idealized other), ludus (playful or gamelike love),storge (slowly developing attachment), mania (obsessive and jealous love), agape (altru-istic love), and pragma (practical love). In their own 1984 factor analytic study, RobertHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 224THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE: LOVE, MARRIAGE, AND THE BABY CARRIAGE
225Sternberg and Susan Gracek identified one overarching factor, which they termed
interpersonal communication, sharing, and support (later called intimacy). In otherwords, many items on the scale grouped into this single component of love.
What is the triangular theory of love?
Drawing from previous research, Robert Sternberg proposed the triangular theory of
love in a 1986 paper. In this model, all love is composed of three elements: intimacy,
passion, and commitment . Intimacy involves closeness, caring, and emotional sup-
port. Passion refers to states of emotional and physiological arousal. This includes sex-ual arousal and physical attraction, as well as other kinds of intense emotional experi-ences. For example, parents can feel passionate love toward their children.Commitment involves a decision to commit to loving the other and trying to maintainthat love over time. Using different combinations of these three elements, Sternbergdescribed eight different kinds of love: nonlove (low on all three elements), liking(high on intimacy only), infatuated love (passion only), empty love (commitmentonly), romantic love (intimacy and passion), companionate love (intimacy and com-mitment), fatuous love (passion and commitment), and consummate love (all threetogether). While this approach may not capture the full complexities of love, it doesseem to make intuitive sense.
How does love differ for lovers, family, and friends?
Is love the same for different kinds of relationships? Do we love different people dif-ferently? Research suggests that the feeling of intimacy, emotional connection, andcloseness is central to all types of love. What may differ across relationships is thedegree of passion, as well as the level of commitment. We can speculate that all loverelationships would have high levels of intimacy; romantic love would have high lev-els of passion; and familial and long-term romantic relationships would have highlevels of commitment. In fact, Sternberg and Gracek found that the intimacy compo-nent of love cut across all close relationships, with similar ratings for family, friend-ship, and romantic relationships. In a 1985 study by Keith Davis, spouses or loversdid not differ that much from close friends on liking (similar to Sternberg’s conceptof intimacy), but did differ on loving (which they conceptualized as liking plus pas-sion and commitment).
What does evolution have to do with love?
In the past decade or two, evolutionary explanations of human psychology have becomeincreasingly popular. Psychologists ask how various psychological phenomena evolved.What function have specific psychological patterns served in human evolution? Morespecifically, what function did love serve in human evolution? Evolutionary explanationsfor love can be divided into theories of mating behavior, attachment, and infatuation.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 225What makes a man attractive to the opposite sex?
Generally, young, physically fit, and
muscular men with no signs of
disease or malformation are consid-ered attractive. Large pectoral muscle-mass and broad shoulders suggestupper body strength. Across evolution,these traits probably aided in sexualselection. In other words, traits thatwe associate with masculine beautyprovide an evolutionary advantage.Masculine beauty advertises to womenthe man’s ability to provide physicalprotection as well as to pursue orcompete for food and other resources.
Masculine beauty also signals the
man’s ability to compete with othermen for women. An appreciation ofmale beauty would help womenchoose mates that enhance their ownreproductive success, both by ensur-ing better support in child care andby contributing genes that maximizetheir children’s own reproductive fit-ness. While we know that culturestrongly affects our notions of mascu-line beauty—for example with regard to hairstyle, fashion, and bodily adorn-ment—we can still conclude that there is a biological basis to basic notions ofmale beauty and that such patterns have evolutionary significance.
Physical beauty sends signals to women that a man has an
evolutionary and competitive advantage over less healthy andfit males (iStock).
226What are the evolutionary theories of mating behavior?
A number of researchers have suggested that evolutionary pressures resulted in different
reproductive strategies for men and women. In other words, the best way to pass genesonto the next generation may be different for men than for women. Men can reproducequickly with little cost in time or energy. However, they have less control over the out-come of their mating, whether their offspring will grow to sexual maturity and be able topass their genes onto the next generation. Thus, it is in their evolutionary interest tohedge their bets and spread their genes as widely as possible, particularly with femalesHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 226THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE: LOVE, MARRIAGE, AND THE BABY CARRIAGE
227who show “fertility markers,” such as youth and beauty. Women, on the other hand, put
tremendous time and energy into reproduction, through pregnancy, lactation, and childrearing. It is in their interest to mate with fewer men and be more selective in theirchoice of a mate, focusing on the resources he can provide for child rearing.
This model, which is often referred to as the theory of sexual selection, has
received considerable empirical support. For example, in a 1989 study by David Buss,10,000 men and women across thirty-seven different cultures were interviewed aboutwhat they looked for in a mate. Men stressed physical attraction and women stressedhigh status, wealth, and ambition. Moreover, studies show that both homosexual andheterosexual men are more likely to engage in promiscuous and casual sex than eitherheterosexual or homosexual women. In fact, homosexual men are more likely toengage in promiscuous sex than heterosexual men, presumably because the sexualbehavior of heterosexual men is limited by the preferences of their female partners.
Is attachment important in evolution?
The sexual selection theory has been criticized, however, for its neglect of emotionalattachment. People seek out a romantic partner not only for sexual satisfaction, butalso for emotional support and fulfillment. In both Buss’s and Sternberg and Gracek’sstudies, attachment-related traits, such as kindness and understanding, were listed byboth sexes as the most important considerations in romantic relationships. Moreover,these findings appear to be valid across cultures, as Buss collected his data from thir-ty-seven different cultures. According to Cindy Hazan and Lisa Diamond, attachmentbonds between sexual partners, otherwise known as romantic love, may be just asimportant to evolution as sexual selection.
Is romantic love related to parental love?
The attachment bond between mothers and fathers may have developed out of theevolutionarily older bond between mother and infant. The fact that many more animalspecies show strong bonds between mothers and infants than show bonds betweenmothers and fathers suggests that the parent-child emotional bond is an earlier andmore wide-spread evolutionary development than the romantic bond. In other words,romantic love probably evolved out of parental love.
What evolutionary purpose does romantic love serve?
Researchers propose that romantic love evolved to promote paternal investment inthe raising of dependent children. Children who benefited from the care of both par-ents were more likely to survive to adulthood and pass their genes onto the next gen-eration. Therefore, the capacity to seek out and maintain a strong bond with a mate(i.e., romantic love) provided an evolutionary advantage. Even in today’s world, con-Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 227siderable research shows that paternal involvement brings powerful advantages for
children, providing financial, cognitive, and emotional benefits. Moreover, studiesshow that children also benefit from a strong and harmonious relationship betweentheir parents.
What is the evolutionary function of falling in love?
We can draw a distinction between the general feeling of love and the heady, intoxicat-ing experience of being in love . The experience of falling in love is a widespread one,
something that most people have experienced at some point in their life. Psychologistsdescribe this emotional state as involving the idealization of the partner and a yearn-ing to spend time with him or her. There is also great sexual desire for the partner andheightened emotional arousal. In their 2000 paper, Cindy Hazan and Lisa Diamondspeculated that this mental state serves to keep the lovers focused and preoccupiedwith each other long enough for a more sustainable form of love to develop. Theseauthors theorize that the attachment aspect of love, similar to what Sternberg consid-ered the intimacy component of love, is what keeps long-term relationships alive.However, it takes time to develop. So infatuation, or the intoxicating state of being inlove, serves as a sort of scaffold over which attachment and intimacy can develop. This
suggests that infatuation is inherentlyshort lived. Indeed research supports theshort life of infatuation; several studiessuggest the average length of romanticinfatuation is about two years.
What makes a woman physically
attractive to men?
While fashions in female beauty can vary
across culture and throughout history,there are certain constant features thatare attractive to men. Signs of youth,health, and fertility always form the basisof notions of female beauty. For example,round breasts and a low waist-to hip ratioare universal signs of femininity and fer-tility. Smooth, unwrinkled skin and thelack of gray hair signify youth. The beau-ty industry makes an enormous amountof money enhancing women’s signals offitness and fertility. By enhancing the redcolor in her lips and cheeks, a woman canappear to have greater blood flow to her

maintain a youthful appearance.
What do we know about the neurobiology of love?
The anthropologist Helen Fisher has conducted a series of studies on the neurobiolo-gy of love. In a 1998 article, she proposed a three-part system. This system is com-posed of the sex drive, attraction , and attachment. The sex drive is associated with sex
hormones, specifically estrogens and androgens. Attraction is similar to romantic
infatuation. This euphoric preoccupation with the desired mate is mediated by twokinds of neurotransmitters, dopamine and norepinephrine. Dopamine is associated
with the reward circuitry and is involved with many kinds of desire. Norepinephrine isinvolved with arousal, as well as attention and focus. Attachment is associated withthe hormones oxytocin and vasopressin.
These hormones, known as neuropeptides, are evolutionarily ancient chemicals
that are involved in a broad range of social behaviors. Oxytocin is released duringnursing and childbirth and is also released in both males and females during sexualintercourse and after orgasm. Dr. Fisher speculates that these three systems are rela-tively independent of each other. Combining these systems in different ways allowshuman beings to engage in a broad repertoire of mating and reproductive strategies.In other words, people can highlight sex, attachment, or infatuation at different timesor with different people.
Do views of love vary across cultures?
We can presume that the components of love proposed by Sternberg can be found inall cultures. Intimacy, passion, and commitment are most likely cultural universals.Evidence of this comes from many sources, including cultural anthropology, psy-chological research, and love poetry from across the world. What does appear to varyacross cultures, however, is the emphasis placed on the different components of loveand on different types of relationships. In collectivist cultures like those found in
Asia and Africa, relationships with family may take priority over relationships withlovers and friends. In individualistic cultures, like those of Northern Europe and
North America, friendships and romantic relationships compete with family for pri-ority (and often win). Likewise, the concept of duty (similar to Sternberg’s conceptof commitment) is absolutely central to Chinese Confucianism. In contrast, judgingby the mountains of romance novels, love songs, and beauty products found inNorth America, it is the passionate side of love that is prized in this culture.

Why talk about marriage?
This playground chant illustrates the long-standing cultural expectation that roman-
tic love inevitably leads to marriage. While this progression may have been the normfor most of American history, current social trends have veered away from this singlepath. In 2007, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, fifty-six percent of the populationover age fifteen was married. This means, however, that forty-four percent of the pop-ulation was not. With the growth of single-parent households, single-person house-holds, non-married cohabitating couples and same-sex couples, is it outdated to studythe institution of marriage? Although the legal institution of marriage is no longer thesole option for adult relationships, it is still extremely widespread. The vast majority ofpeople will be married at some point in their lifetimes, with estimates as high as nine-ty percent. Likewise, marriage as an institution is extremely widespread, essentially acultural universal. For these reasons, marriage merits discussion in its own right.Furthermore, much of the material discussed below, such as what contributes to thesuccess or failure of a marriage, is also relevant to non-marital relationships.
Are there health benefits to marriage?
In general, marriage confers benefits for both emotional and physical health. Marriedpeople tend to report higher life satisfaction and lower psychological distress thansingle people, meaning those who never married, or are widowed or divorced. Thismust be qualified, however, by the quality of the marriage. Unhappily married people
report greater emotional distress than single people. Thus, it appears that being mar-ried has benefits over being single, unless one is unhappily married. It is also notclear whether the benefits are solely due to marriage per se or to the benefits of anylong-term, committed relationship. Research is very clear that social support is acritical protective factor against emotional and physical stress. It is no surprise,therefore, that single people who establish solid social support networks often reporthigh life satisfaction.
What makes a marriage last?
As marriages progress, the passion that may have characterized the early days tends tomellow into a deep bond of intimacy and commitment. Therefore, the relationship
230Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 230qualities that promote intimacy and commitment are most important to a long-last-
ing marriage. Strong communication, the ability to manage conflict constructively,shared experiences and values, and high levels of warmth and affection all contributeto successful marriages. In addition, financial stability, positive ties to the extendedfamily, and positive role models in the families of both partners (rather than frequentdivorces and marital acrimony) are associated with long-term marriages.
What makes a marriage fail?
Research suggests that marriages of people in their early twenties or younger aremore likely to fail than marriages between older partners. Further, overly hasty mar-riages, such as those that take place within six months after meeting, are less likely tosucceed. Additionally, insecure financial status, distant or acrimonious relationshipswith the extended family, and the absence of positive marital examples in the extendedfamily are associated with poor marital outcome. As described in a 1993 paper by JohnGottman, marital failure can also be predicted by the quality of the interactionsbetween a couple. Couples who displayed high levels of defensiveness, contempt,stonewalling, and criticism, as well as facial expressions of disgust were more likely toend up separated or divorced several years later.
How important are common interests?
Contrary to popular belief, opposites do not attract, at least not that much. People are
most likely to be attracted to partners who are similar to them. Research shows thatspouses tend to share a great deal of similarities with regard to interests, personality,attitudes, ethnic background, educational goals or attainment, and even height. Rela-tionships tend to work better and last longer between partners who are fairly similarto each other. Partners should not expect to share all interests, values or attitudes, butit is helpful to have considerable overlap.
How important is communication in marriage?
Effective communication is a critical ingredient to a successful marriage. In fact, mostmarital therapies focus on enhancing communication. While it is not necessary andcan even be destructive to hash out every little bump in the marital path, it is criticalthat recurrent problems or personally meaningful issues be discussed directly. Peoplecannot be expected to automatically know what their partner wants or needs or whatis making the other person unhappy. When there is insufficient communication, mis-understandings can arise, resulting in unnecessary conflict. Additionally, inadequatecommunication can lead to emotional distance as partners can grow apart. If this con-tinues unabated, one partner can end up seeking emotional and sexual intimacy out-side the marriage.
231THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE: LOVE, MARRIAGE, AND THE BABY CARRIAGEHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 231Is it normal to argue during marriage?
It is certainly normal to argue during marriage. Marriage constitutes one of the most
intimate and long-lasting relationships in one’s entire life; spouses’ lives are profound-ly intertwined. Therefore, it is inescapable that there will be a degree of conflict. Whilesome conflict is entirely expectable, if the marriage is dominated by conflict, maritalsatisfaction will suffer. The good days should definitely outnumber the bad days. More-over, the method of handling conflict is very important. Healthy conflict managementenhances the marital bond, but destructive modes of dealing with conflict can severelydamage the marriage.
Are there good and bad ways to fight in a marriage?
There are definitely good and bad ways to fight (or argue) in a marriage. In general,people should address their concerns directly, keep their focus on the specific behav-iors or circumstances that cause the problem, clearly state emotions, needs andthoughts, acknowledge responsibility for one’s own contribution to the problem, andencourage the other person to express his or her viewpoint. Ineffective strategiesinclude blaming, stonewalling, emotional explosiveness, name-calling, defensiveness,and resurrection of every complaint since the beginning of the relationship. Researchshows that these behaviors serve to escalate the conflict rather than resolve it. It is alsoa problem when people become more invested in winning the argument than in resolv-
232
Arguments between spouses can be disturbing, but they are perfectly normal when they occur on occasion. If arguments dominate a
marriage, however, the results will be detrimental to a happy union ( iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 232ingit. While no one can be perfectly mature at all times, and it is expectable that every-
one will regress to immature behavior occasionally, it is vitally important to cultivate
constructive conflict management skills. A robust literature shows that poor conflictnegotiation is a key ingredient in marital unhappiness and, ultimately, divorce.
What is the impact of avoiding conflict in a marriage?
Although too much conflict is clearly damaging to a marriage and husbands and wivesmust learn the important art of letting little things go, it is also harmful to a marriageto completely avoid conflict. When people continually avoid difficult topics, misunder-standings can grow and couples can start to grow apart. By tiptoeing around the diffi-cult issues, couples introduce distance into their relationship. In so doing, theydeprive their relationship of the shared experience and mutual knowledge that providethe emotional foundation of marriage.
What are some dos and don’ts in marital spats?
Based on clinical and research literature, the table below is a helpful guide to some ofthe things one should or should not say when arguing with a spouse:
Do Don’t
Focus on resolving the problem Focus on winning the argument
Discuss a specific problem Attack the entire relationship
Stick to the present as much as possible Bring up a list of past grievances
Focus on behavior not character Make the problem about your partner’s
personality flaws
Clearly state your own feelings and thoughts Expect your partner to read your
mind. Stop talking out of pride. Refuseto admit that your partner “got to you”
Accept responsibility for your own Defensively refuse to acknowledge any
contribution to the problem contribution to the problem,invalidating your partner’s every point
Acknowledge the other person’s feelings Invalidate your partner’s emotional
experience
Suggest solutions Expect your partner to “fix it” or“change” without specific suggestions

Keep the problem between you and Bring other people into the argument,
your partner declaring how many friends and familyagree with you
233THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE: LOVE, MARRIAGE, AND THE BABY CARRIAGEHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 233How important is sex to a marriage?
For most marriages, sex is a very important ingredient. A healthy, mutually satisfying
sex life can enhance intimacy and passion and provide an important buffer against theinevitable strains and stresses of marriage. An unsatisfying sex life can both cause dif-ficulties in a marriage and be a symptom of relationship problems. It is important tonote, however, that not all couples require the same degree of sexual activity. More-over, sexual activity tends to decrease as couples age. What is important is that thesexual relationship works for both members of the couple.
How do sex roles vary across marriages?
A distinction is frequently made between traditional vs. egalitarian sex roles. In tradi-
tional sex roles, the man is the provider and the head of the household. It is hisresponsibility to financially support his family and to protect them from danger. He isthe final authority in the family; his wife is ultimately subordinate to him. Thewoman’s role is to take care of the family. She performs domestic services, includingcooking, cleaning, shopping, and childcare. In more egalitarian marriages, neitherpaid work nor household responsibilities are exclusively the domain of one partner orthe other. Partners have equal power and authority in the family and neither partneris subordinate to the other. With the dramatic social changes that have occurred sincethe 1960s, sex roles in Western society have become considerably more egalitarian. Tosome extent, these social changes have even impacted non-Western industrial soci-eties, such as India and Japan. Nonetheless, many studies show that men still tend tomake more money than their wives and wives do considerably more housework thantheir husbands.
What impact do changing sex roles have on marriages?
The impact of changing sex roles on marriage is complex. In the 1970s when thewomen’s liberation movement reached full force, there was a strong increase indivorce rates. Divorced rates peaked in the 1980s and leveled off by the 2000s. It islikely this peak in marital turmoil had more to do with the disruptions in sex roles andto couples’ difficulty adjusting to changing expectations than with the specific natureof the new sex roles. As both men and women become accustomed to women’s greaterparticipation in the workforce and their greater autonomy, it seems marriages havebecome more stable. Nonetheless, greater individualism in general tends to lead tohigher divorce rates, as people prioritize their personal satisfaction ahead of familyties. On the other hand, several studies have found that greater equality in sex rolescorrelated with higher marital satisfaction even in fairly traditional cultures.
Egalitarian sex roles appeared to increase marital harmony, which correlated with
higher marital satisfaction in both partners. Accordingly, a 2006 study by MarietHagedoorn and colleagues showed that marital partners who perceived their marriage
234Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 234to be equitable reported less psychologi-
cal distress than those who perceived it tobe inequitable. Interestingly, even thepartners who believed they benefitedmore from the inequity than their spousereported greater psychological distress.
How have the rates of marriage
changed over time in the United
States?
Despite the remarkable changes in sexroles over the last four decades, the over-all marriage statistics have not changedas dramatically as one might predict. In1950, according to the U.S. CensusBureau, an estimated 32 percent of thepopulation over age fifteen had nevermarried, 68 percent were currently mar-ried, 4 percent were widowed, and 2 per-cent divorced. In 2007, an estimated 33percent of the population had never mar-ried, 56 percent were married, 2 percentwidowed, and 8 percent divorced.
Has the age of marrying changed over time in the United States?
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, people are marrying approximately five yearslater now than they did in the mid-twentieth century. The median age of first mar-riage in 1950 was 22.8 years for men and 20.3 years for women. In 2007, it was 27.5years for men and 25.6 years for women.
Do approaches to marriage vary across cultures?
The distinction between collectivist cultures and individualistic cultures is frequentlymade in cross-cultural studies. In collectivist cultures, found in many Asian countriessuch as Korea, India, and China, an individual’s identity is tied to his or her socialgroup. In individualistic countries, such as the United States, Canada, and Australia,the individual’s independent identity is prioritized. People from collectivist culturesexpect love to grow as the marriage unfolds over time. When choosing a spouse, thereis less emphasis on romance and infatuation. Instead, people emphasize practical con-cerns, such as income potential, parenting ability, and compatibility with the extended

The institution of marriage has changed considerably in

of love when looking for a spouse. They focus on feelings of excitement and physicalattraction. Using Sternberg’s triangular theory of love, Ge Gao measured the role ofintimacy, passion, and commitment in ninety Chinese and seventy-seven Americancouples in a 2001 study. Ratings of passion were higher in American than Chinesecouples, but ratings of intimacy and commitment did not differ. People from individu-alist countries also tend to have fewer children and a higher divorce rate.
236Are men really from Mars and women from Venus?
How different are men and women?
Our understanding of the similarities and differences between the two gen-ders has varied with cultural shifts. For much of recorded history, women
were seen to be vastly different from men and even inferior—weak, passive, irra-tionally emotional, and intellectually impaired. The feminist movement in the1970s reacted against these derogatory views, shepherding in an emphasis onthe similarities between the genders.
In recent decades, however, there has been increased attention paid to the
ways that men and women differ. Although we cannot know for sure how muchof these differences derive from biology or from environment (nature vs. nur-ture), research does suggest that men and women are not the same. In 1990,Janet Shibley Hyde published a meta-analysis of studies on gender differencesacross several psychological traits. She found that men scored considerablyhigher than women on tests of aggression and mathematical ability, and moder-ately higher on tests of certain spatial abilities. Women did better than men,however, on tests of verbal ability.
Another way that men and women may differ is in their response to stress.
The “tend and befriend” model was proposed by Shelley Taylor and colleagues in2000. They suggest that, compared to men, women are more likely to exhibitnurturing and affiliative behavior in response to stress. This appears to be medi-ated by the interaction between estrogen and oxytocin. Men, on the other hand,are more likely to exhibit a “fight or flight” response to stress, mediated by thebrain chemicals norepinephrine and epinephrine. The male sex hormone testos-terone may also support men’s “fight or flight” responses.
It is important to keep in mind, however, that we cannot know how much of
these differences are learned and how much are hard-wired. While it is reason-able to believe that men and women differ, the degree of those differences mightbe strongly influenced by cultural and environmental factors. Even biologicalprocesses can be strongly influenced by environment.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 236PREGNANCY
What are the psychological challenges of pregnancy ?
Becoming a parent entails one of the biggest psychological transformations of one’s
life. Luckily, nature gives women about forty weeks to prepare for this change. Duringthis time both parents can make the necessary practical arrangements to prepare forthe arrival of the baby. Simultaneously, they undergo a process of psychological trans-formation wherein they adjust to the enormous responsibility of parenting. Bothmother- and father-to-be must reconfigure their identity from that of their parents’
child into their child’s parent. Furthermore, they must gird themselves for the loss of
autonomy that inevitably comes with parenthood. After a child is born, a parent is nolonger a single, unitary person, responsible only to himself or herself. From now on,every decision will be made from the vantage point of a responsible parent. As any par-ent can tell you, even when the children grow up and leave home, the sense ofparental responsibility never completely goes away.
What are the changes in identity the first-time parent undergoes?
For the pregnant woman, especially, the sense of identity is drastically altered by theknowledge that another person is growing inside her. The woman’s body no longerbelongs to one person, it now contains two people. Likewise, the woman’s identityexpands from beyond a self-contained sense of self, to a broader, more encompassingidentity that incorporates her new child. If we think of the enormous investment oftime, energy, and resources that parents unthinkingly bestow on their children, wehave to be impressed. Parents routinely spend inordinate sums of money, make extra-ordinary sacrifices and, at times, even give up their life—all for the sake of their chil-dren. In no other arena are humans so powerfully altruistic. Evolutionary biologistssum this up to the evolutionary imperative to pass on one’s genes. On the psychologi-cal level, this drive manifests in a transformation of identity; what was one becomestwo. The parent sees the child not as a wholly separate person but, to some degree, asan extension of themselves.
How does the relationship with the parent’s own parent impact the
psychological challenge of pregnancy?
In pregnancy, the parent comes face-to-face with the experience of nurturing a help-less, dependent infant. Consequently, old feelings and memories of being parented will
inevitably be stimulated. This may happen on a conscious level, in which expectantparents actively reflect on their own childhood relationship with their parents. It mayalso happen on an unconscious level, with the impact of childhood experiences onlyvisible through fantasies, attitudes, and expectations about the new baby. If the child-
237THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE: LOVE, MARRIAGE, AND THE BABY CARRIAGEHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 237hood relationship was largely positive,
expectant parents can gain a new appreci-ation for the level of work and devotionprovided by their own parents. Theybecome more understanding of whattheir parents went through.
If the relationship was problematic,
these difficulties may interfere with thepreparation for parenthood. The expec-tant parents may have heightened insecu-rities about their ability to function as aparent, exaggerated fears of the baby’sdemands, or of their ability to meet theemotional needs of their baby. Alterna-tively, there may be a constricted abilityto imagine and anticipate the future rela-tionship with the baby at all. Regardless
of the quality of the original parent-child relationship, pregnancy is a time for expec-tant parents to reflect on their own experience of being parented, and consider whatthey would and would not like to repeat with their own children.
How do parents’ relationships with their own parents tend to change
with a pregnancy?
Overall, families tend to become closer when a new generation is born. Mothers anddaughters, in particular, come together as new mothers need considerable supportand information during this period. Early adulthood is often a time during whichadult children and their parents lead fairly independent lives, as young adults aim toestablish their separate life and identity. In pregnancy, however, that trajectory isreversed. Expectant parents need furniture, baby clothes, maternity clothing, advice,and even help with everyday tasks if the pregnancy becomes physically demanding. Atthis point, grandparents often step back into a caretaking, or at least supportive, role.In some cases, this can lead to control battles, but frequently the shared devotion tothe new baby enhances the relationship between new parents and their own parents.
What physiological challenges does the pregnant woman undergo?
Pregnant women undergo massive physiological changes throughout their pregnancy.There is tremendous hormonal upheaval and an obviously dramatic shift in bodily sizeand shape. For some women, the bodily changes are sources of pride and excitement.For other women, however, there is fear of the weight gain and of a permanent loss oftheir figure. In the first trimester of pregnancy, most of the fundamental bodily and
238
Families tend to become closer when new babies arrive
(iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 238neurological structures are laid down. This entails tremendous hormonal surges,
which often result in nausea and morning sickness for the mother. Although womenhave not gained much weight yet, there is often considerable discomfort. In the secondtrimester, the morning sickness generally resolves and the fetus grows to sufficient sizethat the mother starts to look pregnant. She starts to “show.” This is also the time of
quickening, when the baby starts to kick. In the third trimester, most of the fetal bodily
structures are already developed. At this point, the fetus just needs to grow. During thisperiod, women suffer the most discomfort from the changes to their bodily size andshape. They lose a good deal of mobility and often have difficulty sleeping.
What is the impact of hormones on the experience of pregnancy?
The hormonal surges have both physical and emotional effects on the pregnantwoman. In the first trimester when the hormone surges are at their peak, women suf-fer from nausea and morning sickness. They also suffer from mood swings and emo-tional volatility. Such emotional upset can be disruptive to the marital relationship, astheir partners are most likely to take the brunt of it. By the second trimester, thistends to cool down. In fact the second trimester is known as the most enjoyable part ofpregnancy. The mother is past the physical discomfort and emotional upheaval of thefirst trimester, yet still relatively physically nimble.
What role does oxytocin play in the psychological make-up of the
expectant mother?
The role of oxytocin and a related chemical called vasopressin have received increas-ing attention in scientific circles. Oxytocin is integrally connected with pregnancy,childbirth, lactation, and parenting. We can speculate that the surges of oxytocin thatoccur during pregnancy help condition the mother to nurture her baby. Research haslinked oxytocin to attachment, so we can assume that increased oxytocin release dur-ing pregnancy will enhance the mother-infant bond. It may also contribute to theintense preoccupation with the new baby that mothers develop during pregnancy.
What are the challenges that fathers undergo during their
partner’s pregnancy?
During pregnancy, fathers must start to develop an attachment to the child they havenot yet met and, at this point, can only know through their imagination. For manymen this task can be quite challenging, as they do not go through the same massivebodily changes that women do. The baby may not seem quite real to them. Thisappears to be verified in a 2006 study by Lindsey Gerner, where the strongest predictorto paternal-fetal attachment was the number of ultrasound visits. Evidently, the sono-grams helped the babies feel more real to the fathers. Additionally, new fathers often
239THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE: LOVE, MARRIAGE, AND THE BABY CARRIAGEHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 239What is “couvade”?
Afascinating cross-cultural phe-
nomenon, termed couvade,
speaks to how some men process thepsychological challenges facingexpectant fathers. Couvade has beenwitnessed in many different cultures,and may have even been recorded byMarco Polo during his world travels.In couvade, an expectant father takeson some of the physical symptomsassociated with pregnancy. Suchsymptoms include gastro-intestinalproblems, sleep disturbances, andeven weight gain.
This appears to serve several psy-
chological purposes. By exhibitingsome of the physical symptoms ofpregnancy, the expectant fathersimultaneously draws closer to his wife, demands recognition of his role in thepregnancy process, and psychologically prepares himself for the new baby’s arrival.Some authors suggest there are biological causes for this phenomenon as well aspsychological ones. Indeed, there is evidence that during pregnancy, men undergohormonal changes that are similar in quality if not quantity with their pregnantpartners. Studies have shown increased prolactin and estradiol and decreasedtestosterone during and immediately after pregnancy in both males and females.
It has been shown that some men empathize so much with
their pregnant wives that they may experience some of thephysical symptoms of pregnancy ( iStock).
240feel intimidated by the enormous responsibility of parenthood, anxiously doubting
their capacity to handle it.
While women generally express such anxiety in terms of their ability to nurture,
men often focus upon financial concerns. Many men are intensely concerned withtheir capacity to provide financial support for their growing family. Finally, an expec-tant father’s experience of pregnancy may be highly dependent on the state of the rela-tionship with the mother. Several studies note relationships between a father’s maritalsatisfaction and his involvement and satisfaction with pregnancy and child rearing.This suggests that, although involvement with their children is a profoundly mean-ingful experience for most men, the father-child relationship is highly influenced bythe marital relationship. The mother-child relationship is probably not influenced tosuch a great extent. This highlights a pattern that will hold throughout parenthood;Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 240THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE: LOVE, MARRIAGE, AND THE BABY CARRIAGE
241both for the marital relationship and the child, it is crucial that the focus on the new
baby not overshadow the needs of the marriage.
PARENTING
How important is parent-child attachment?
For many parents, the love they feel for their children is the most intense love they haveever felt. Some parents talk about falling in love with their baby. It is not a rational feel-ing; it does not come from choice or deliberation. It is a profoundly powerful experiencethat changes the new parent’s life. From the perspective of evolutionary theory, thisblind parental love makes perfect sense. Children are wholly dependent on their parents;they require enormous investments of time, energy, and treasure over many years. Ifparents did not feel such intense love for their children, they would be hard pressed tomake the sacrifices necessary for their children to survive, let alone thrive.
What are the biggest stresses in the first year of the baby’s life?
Despite the profound rewards of welcoming a new baby into the home, the first year ofthe baby’s life brings considerable stress. Probably most dramatic is the disruption insleep. Additionally, there is a tremendous loss of personal time as an infant demandsnear-constant attention. Even finding the time to take a shower can pose a challenge attimes. There are financial changes, as well, if a working woman stays home to look afterher baby. If she goes back to work, child care arrangements must be made. Finally, par-enting an infant involves marked changes in routine. Meals, social life, laundry, andmany other aspects of daily life must now be arranged around child care. Eventually,parents establish new routines, but the transition period can be a time of notable stress.
How do people vary in their understanding of gender roles in parenting?
While nature has prepared women to be integrally involved in child care, there ismuch more variability with regard to the role of the father. Most fathers are involvedin the support and protection of their family, but the degree to which they areinvolved in the day-to-day process of parenting can vary considerably across culturesand across historical periods. In modern Western society, changes in sex roles over thelast several decades have radically changed cultural views about fathers’ roles in childcare. Although women still do the majority of child care, fathers are now expected toassume more child-care responsibilities than their own fathers may have done. Thisshift in roles can lead to some confusion as partners may have differing views andexpectations about a father’s role. A number of studies address that fact that newfathers seem to lack clarity about their role as a parent. These studies show that newHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 241fathers often feel uncertain about their relevance to the whole process, may have diffi-
culty appreciating the degree of stress their partner is undergoing, and often haveunrealistic attitudes about parenting techniques.
What impact does the new baby have on the marriage?
The birth of a baby has an enormous impact on a marriage. Just as the lives of theindividual parents are permanently transformed by the birth of a child, the marriage istransformed as well. Parenthood undoubtedly brings the couple closer together; theynow share the awesome and profound experience of bringing a new life into the world.Nonetheless, the arrival of the new baby brings considerable pressures to the mar-riage. For one, infants are extraordinarily time-consuming and the demands of aneonate can feel relentless. Secondly, it takes several months before infants developregular sleep patterns. Sheer exhaustion can easily increase parents’ irritability andemotional volatility. The disruption in routine is also difficult on a marriage.
What factors help a marriage transition into parenting?
Research has shown that couples that have the most realistic expectations of what lifewill be like once the baby is born have the easiest adjustment to parenthood. Additionalprotective factors include clarity and agreement about each parent’s role, the establish-ment of routines, and protected time to devote to the marriage (e.g., weekly date night).Social support and financial stability also help the marital transition to parenthood.
What are the major issues relating to discipline?
Discipline is an essential aspect of parenting and inadequate discipline can be verydetrimental to a child’s development. Parents must aim to find the balance between
appropriate limit setting and empathicacceptance of the child’s developmentallevel. Finding the right balance is no easytask. Nonetheless, parents must searchfor the correct path between being toostrict and controlling on one hand andbeing too permissive on the other hand.
Why is limit setting so important
in parenting?
Limit setting is a critical aspect of parent-ing because children cannot be expectedto regulate themselves. They need to betaught. Many parents feel it is easier to
242
Parents should discipline their children in order to set limits
on behavior, but too much or too little can be detrimental(iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 242give in to the child’s protests and avoid the fight than to tolerate the child’s upset and
anger. This is unfortunate as parents must tolerate some discomfort in the short runin order to raise well-regulated children. Children without limits feel they have toomuch power in the relationship with their parents and this makes them feel unsafe.Although they do not like feeling frustrated and they certainly like to get what theywant, they also sense that they are ill-qualified to be in charge of their own lives, anddepend upon an adult to step up and take control.
How does limit setting promote frustration tolerance?
Reasonable limit setting teaches children how to control their emotions and impulses.Without this necessary skill, a child will not be able to function effectively in a social set-ting. Therefore, when parents jump in to rescue their children each time they exhibitfrustration or anxiety, they are depriving their children of the opportunity to learn tomanage negative emotions. This undermines the development of crucial problem-solv-ing and emotion-regulation skills. A child’s family may be willing to be indulgent; theoutside world is far less likely to be as tolerant of the child’s whims. Thus, if children arenot raised to adapt to the world outside their family, they are headed for a considerableamount of frustration, anxiety, and interpersonal problems. These problems can easilycontinue into adulthood as the previously indulged child is poorly equipped to negotiatethe inevitable frustrations encountered in the realm of work and adult relationships.
What are the dangers of being too strict?
On the other hand, there is danger in being too strict and too controlling. Whenparental discipline feels excessively harsh, arbitrary or self-serving, parental authorityloses legitimacy. The child may develop an antagonistic relationship with authority,responding to a wide range of authority figures with rebellious opposition or fearfulresentment. Likewise, such children may have great difficulty translating parental dis-cipline into self-discipline, which is the ultimate goal of all parental discipline. Inadulthood, this might manifest in a refusal to exercise self-control or in problems withprocrastination. Alternatively, overly controlled children can become excessively pas-sive, their initiative and autonomy significantly constrained.
What is Diana Baumrind’s classification of parenting styles?
A line of research initiated in the 1970s by Diana Baumrind delineates different styles ofparenting. After observing parents interacting with their preschool children, Baumrindidentified three types of interaction: acceptance and involvement, control (meaning theexercise of parental control), and autonomy granting (allowing children to make theirown decisions). Four different styles of parenting were identified based on these behav-ioral patterns. Authoritative parents are high on all three types of behaviors, balancing
parental control and recognition of the child’s autonomy. Authoritarian parents are
243THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE: LOVE, MARRIAGE, AND THE BABY CARRIAGEHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 243244high on parental control but low on acceptance-involvement and autonomy granting.
Permissive parents are low on parental control and high on autonomy granting. They
are high on acceptance but not always high on involvement, as such parents can beinattentive as well as over-indulgent. Uninvolved parents are low on all three types of
behavior. Of the four parenting styles, authoritative parents produce the best results,with the most upbeat, self-assured, and socially and emotionally competent children.
When does corporal punishment turn into abuse?
For centuries, corporal punishment was an acceptable and expected part of child rear-ing. In recent decades, however, corporal punishment has been branded outdated andneedlessly violent. Nonphysical forms of discipline such as time-outs are recommend-ed instead. A good deal of research supports the greater effectiveness of non-physicalforms of discipline. However, the use of corporal discipline varies across cultural sub-groups. Some research has shown that, within African-American communities, chil-dren raised with corporal discipline were less likely to display acting-out behavior, toget in trouble at school or with the police. It seems that corporal discipline can beeffective when it is mild, predictable, performed for the purposes of discipline and notdone out of anger. Corporal punishment becomes abusive when it is excessively harsh,causes ongoing pain or physical injury, is unpredictable or arbitrary, and is motivatedby parental rage rather than the need to instill appropriate standards of behavior.
How important is consistency in parenting?
Maintaining a consistent stance toward children is a challenging task for many par-ents. It is often hard for parents to hold firm to a decision about what is and is notallowed rather than bend to the pressures of the moment. This can be highly problem-atic as children need very clear messages about what the rules are and where theboundaries lie. Moreover, inconsistent enforcement of rules creates its own complica-tions. According to the theory of behaviorism, intermittent reinforcement makes
behavior more resistant to extinction. To illustrate, let’s imagine that a child isdemanding a certain privilege to which the parent initially says “no.” If the parentultimately gives in to the child’s demands, the child learns that “no” does not mean“no” and that parents can be manipulated. When the child next encounters the word“no,” the automatic response will be to ramp up his or her demands in the expectationthat the parent will eventually give in.
How important is affection?
Of course, parenting is not all about discipline. Fundamentally, it is about love. Physi-cal affection plays a critical role in child development, shaping the growing child’sability to tolerate intimacy and physical touch. Moreover, a large body of research doc-uments the importance of warmth and affection in neurobiological development, par-Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 244What has research shown about the importance of
tactile stimulation in early development?
Aseries of studies conducted by
Michael Meaney and colleagues
has shown how early childhood expe-riences actually affect the workingsof our genes. Through ingeniousstudies with rats, he showed howmaternal care had a potent effect ongenes related to the stress response.This process works through chemi-cals known as epigenetic markers,which land on genes and alter geneexpression. In other words they workto turn specific genes off and on.Importantly, they do not alter theDNA sequence but rather the expres-sion of specific genes. The geneticblueprint is not changed, only whatparts of the blue print get built.
Rats raised by high-lick mothers, who provide more tactile stimulation to
their rat pups, were compared to those raised by low-lick mothers. High-lick ratpups had lower levels of the epigenetic markers known as methyl groups thanpups raised by low-lick mothers. They also displayed much less stress and ten-sion and were better able to calm themselves.
These same epigenetic markers came into play in human beings. The
researchers autopsied the brains of people who had died either by suicide or caraccident. They found that people with a history of childhood abuse had moreepigenetic markers than those without. It appears that, in both rats and humans,parental care affects the production of epigenetic markers, which in turn modu-lates the reactivity to stress. Nurturing early environments reduce reactivity tostress while neglectful or abusive environments heighten the stress response.

245ticularly affecting the flexibility of the stress response and capacity for positive emo-
tions. The classic work of Rene Spitz illustrates the tragic effects of emotional depriva-tion. Dr. Spitz studied infants in an orphanage who were separated from their mothersduring World War II. Although they were kept warm, clean, and well fed, these babieswere left with essentially no affection, touch, or personal attention. This gross depriva-Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 245tion profoundly stunted and distorted the infants’ cognitive, motoric, and physical
development. They even had a very high death rate.
What roles do parents play in teaching their children to manage emotion?
Another area in which parents play a crucial role is the development of emotionalcompetence. Children have to learn to recognize, label, and regulate their own emo-tions. Unlike the ability to walk or speak, this is not a skill that children will learn ontheir own with little effort on the parents’ part. Thus the sensitivity of the parents to achild’s experience and expression of emotion has a profound impact on the child’sdeveloping emotional competence. A 1996 study by John Gottman, Lynn Katz, andCarole Hooven found that the quality of parenting when a child was five predicted to arange of outcomes both at age five and at age eight.
The parenting styles measured included emotional coaching, in which parents
teach children to label and then manage their emotions, praising-scaffolding, a kind
of supportive teaching, and derogatory parenting, which involves intrusiveness, criti-cism, and mockery. The outcomes included the child’s emotional regulation, peerrelationships, school achievement, physical health, and vagal nerve tone—a physio-logical measure of stress reactivity. As might be expected, high levels of emotionalcoaching and scaffolding-praising and low levels of derogatory parenting were associ-ated with positive outcomes. Emotional coaching, in particular, predicted to positiveemotional functioning, at age five and at age eight.
What are the main ways that parenting styles vary across cultures?
While parenting in all cultures entails love, devotion, teaching, and discipline, there isconsiderable cultural variation in other aspects of parenting. In general, more tradi-tional, collectivist cultures (e.g., found in Asia and Africa) employ parenting styles thatpromote interdependence, respect for authority, and behavioral control. Individualis-tic cultures (e.g., found in North America and North-Western Europe) promote inde-pendence, less hierarchical relationships, and greater freedom of self-expression. Cul-tures also vary with regards to physical affection. For example, Northern Europeancultures have traditionally been more reserved about emotional expression and physi-cal affection than Southern European cultures.
FAMILIES
What is a family?
The U.S. Census defines families as groups of people related by birth, adoption, ormarriage. More informal definitions include groups of people who live together in
246Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 246long-term committed relationships. For example, many homosexual couples live
together for decades without the benefit of legal recognition. In general, however, thedefinition provided by the U.S. Census reflects the conventional understanding of theterm “family.”
How have family structures changed in the past few decades?
While the basic unit of the family has proved remarkably resilient, there have been con-siderable changes in typical family structure across the last few decades, at least in thedeveloped Western world. For one thing the percentage of single households hasincreased dramatically. As people are marrying later and divorcing more frequently,people are living alone for longer periods of their life. Nonetheless, married coupleswith or without children still comprise the most common family structure. Accordingto the 2000 census, married couples account for more than half of U.S. households,while single people accounted for more than one quarter. Unmarried partners of boththe same and opposite sex, three generational families, and single parents with childrenalso make up a large segment of American households. Furthermore, blended fami-lies—such as combinations of previously divorced families—are also very common.
What has recent U.S. Census data shown about married life in America?
The data in the table below describes the percentage of men and women in 2004 whohave never married or who have been divorced. As the table shows, the traditionalnuclear family is only one of many lifestyles favored within the United States.

How common are single-parent families?
While two-parent families are still the most common type of family structure for fami-lies with children, there has been a huge increase in children born to, or raised in, sin-gle-parent families over recent decades. According to statistics from the U.S. Census,the proportion of single-parent families tripled between 1970 and 1990. In 2008, 70percent of children in the U.S. lived with two parents, 23 percent lived with their
247THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE: LOVE, MARRIAGE, AND THE BABY CARRIAGEHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 247mother only, 3.5 percent with their father only, and 3.8 percent lived with neither par-
ent. However, there are considerable ethnic differences in the frequency of single-par-ent households. For example in 2008, 17 percent of European-American children, 51percent of African-American children, 10 percent of Asian children, and 24 percent ofHispanic children lived with their mother in a single-parent family.
What impact on children do the different family structures have?
There is a fair amount of evidence that children in single-parent families have moreemotional, academic, and social problems than children in two-parent families. How-ever, this data is confounded by the fact that many single-parent families have greaterlevels of poverty, less education, and are more likely to live in high-crime neighbor-hoods. What is clearly important is that parents need adequate social support, finan-cial resources, and protection from inordinate stress in order to provide a stable andnurturing home for their children. The incidence of homosexual parents with chil-dren has also risen in recent decades. Research shows that such children do not differfrom children of heterosexual parents in emotional and social adjustment. Nor do theyseem to differ in sexual orientation, with the vast majority developing heterosexualorientations. However, the social environment in which children of homosexual par-ents are raised does make a difference; accepting environments promote positiveadjustment while environments that do not accept gay families can take a huge psy-chological toll on children.
How do family structures vary across cultures?
The most common way that family structures vary across cultures involves the role ofthe extended family. Modern industrialized and Western cultures favor the nuclearfamily over the extended family. Young married couples move away from their parentsto start their own new family in a separate home. In many traditional cultures, theboundaries between the extended family and the nuclear family are much more dif-fuse. Multiple generations often live together in a single household and grandparents,uncles, and aunts play influential roles in the couple’s marriage and in the rearing oftheir children.
What is meant by the term family systems?
Great insight into the ways that families function has come to us from the family ther-apy literature. Coming of age in the 1960s and 1970s, family therapy broke away fromthe discipline of individual therapy to form its own theories and general philosophicaloutlook. The core idea, influenced by the seminal work of the biologist Ludwig vonBertolanffy, was that families should be looked at as systems and not as a static collec-tion of isolated parts. In other words, families are best understood as a dynamicwhole—almost as living organisms—rather than as an unrelated pile of objects.
248Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 248What does the 2000 U.S. Census tell us about household arrangements
in America?
According to the 2000 U.S. Census, 273.6 million people lived in 105,480,101 house-
holds. An additional 7.8 million people lived in institutions such as group homes, pris-ons, or college dorms. As the table below shows, Americans are living in a wide arrayof residential arrangements, although married couples still predominate. The secondmost common household arrangement is a single person living alone.

How is a family a system?
A system is a whole made up of interacting parts. While families are composed of indi-vidual family members (e.g., mother, father, children), the nature of the family isdetermined by the interactions between family members. The pattern of interactionsamong family members creates the structure of the family system. Families are also
composed of subsystems, such as the siblings or the parents. Because the family is asystem, the members cannot be seen in isolation. If you change one part, you changethe other parts as well. Moreover, activity in one part of the system may reflect dynam-ics in the rest of the system. For example, children may act out at school to force theirestranged parents to unite to discipline them.
What is meant by boundaries in a family?
Salvador Minuchin (1921–) is one of the pioneers of family therapy. He developed aschool of family therapy called structural family therapy. In this approach, Minuchinemphasizes the importance of boundaries . Boundaries refer to the lines between dif-
ferent family members or subsystems that mark the limits of influence, information,and decision-making power. For example, there needs to be a clear boundary between
249THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE: LOVE, MARRIAGE, AND THE BABY CARRIAGEHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 249parents and children. Children do not need to know about the sex lives of their parents
or the details of their financial situation. Moreover, children should not have undueinfluence on their parents’ marriage.
What is the difference between rigid, firm, and permeable boundaries?
In a family, boundaries should be firm, but permeable. If the boundaries are too rigid,there is no communication or mutual influence across generational or interpersonalboundaries. This leads to authoritarian or disengaged family systems. If the bound-aries are too permeable, then there is insufficient respect for privacy and differentfamily members inappropriately interfere with each other’s decisions. This leads to anenmeshed family system. Ultimately, firm but permeable boundaries are optimal. Forexample, parents should listen to the opinions and the preferences of their children,but still make the final decisions.
What is the importance of generational boundaries?
One of the most important boundaries in families with children involves the boundariesbetween parents and children. When the boundary between generations is too perme-able, children have too much information and too much power. The demands of imma-ture minds excessively influence parental decisions, or even the parental marriage. Thisnot only throws the family off kilter because the adults are not in control, but it alsoleaves the children feeling insecure and unprotected. When the boundaries are too rigid,the children may have no influence on parental decision making. Children may feeloverly controlled or unimportant. Ideally, the generational boundary should be firm butpermeable. However, this is the ideal and not always the reality. It is never easy to knowexactly where the boundaries should be. While parents should not expect to always get itright, they should nonetheless strive to maintain appropriate generational boundaries.
What is meant by triangulation?
This concept is associated with another pioneer of family therapy, Murray Bowen(1913–1990). In triangulation , a third person is brought into a two-person relation-
ship as a means of diffusing tension between the original dyad. For example, a parentmay align with a child in an argument against the other parent. When parents trian-gulate a child into their marital relationship, the generational boundaries are violatedand the child is unduly burdened.
How are the boundaries between the family and the outside world defined?
Families not only have boundaries between different family members or subsystems(internal boundaries), but also have boundaries with the outside world (external bound-aries). Such boundaries refer to the degree of influence, time, and information given to
250Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 250people outside the family. For example, families with few relationships outside the imme-
diate family have rigid external boundaries. Those who have too many people flowing inand out of their home, or who let non-family members unduly influence their family lifehave overly porous boundaries. Optimally, families should have firm but permeable bound-aries so that there are strong and positive relationships with people outside the family, butclear distinctions between those who do and do not belong to the family system.
How do marital problems play out in the family dynamics?
Because families are seen as integrated systems, problems in any subsystem can influencethe functioning of the family as a whole. In a typical nuclear family, the marital subsys-tem has more power than other subsystems. Minuchin is very attuned to power hierar-chies within families. In families with children, parents are necessarily on top of the hier-archy, with the most power over the system as a whole. When there are problemsbetween the parents, this affects the rest of the family. For example the children mightdevelop behavioral problems in response to the marital difficulties of the parents. Cer-tainly if the parents cannot act as a coordinated team, this disrupts the family as a whole.
What are the benefits and drawbacks of extended family involvement?
Most families with small children have extensive contact with grandparents, uncles,and/or aunts. Such involvement of the extended family offers considerable benefits, but
251THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE: LOVE, MARRIAGE, AND THE BABY CARRIAGE
It can be a great help when extended family pitches in with raising the children, but such involvement also introduces the risk of
some conflict ( iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 251also potential drawbacks. One important benefit involves a sense of community, of
belonging to a larger social group. Secondly, extended family members can providevery valuable assistance, offering practical, financial, and emotional support. For exam-ple, many grandmothers babysit while mothers are at work. Thirdly, no parent is free ofpersonality flaws. Extended family members can provide alternative role models andrelationships for children. For example, a mother may be loving but also very anxious.A more carefree uncle can provide a different example of how to manage stress. Poten-tial drawbacks include conflicts between parents and extended family members. This iswhere appropriate boundaries come into play. For optimal adjustment, family membersmust work out ways to manage conflict and clarify the boundaries around issues suchas decision making, privacy, and amount of time spent together.
How do family dynamics change across development?
Family dynamics change tremendously as children grow and develop. In the begin-ning when children are young, parents have much more control and authority. Thefamily spends more time together as children are not capable of independent sociallives. The extended family is often more involved at this time as well, as parents needconsiderable support with child care. As the children grow older and more indepen-dent, parents must loosen the reigns. Family members are less exclusively involvedwith each other and more involved with the outside world. Parents depend less onextended family for help in child care.
Eventually, parents and adult children establish more egalitarian relationships, a
transformation that can be quite challenging at times. Parents must allow their grownchildren more independence and adult children must take on responsibility for theirown lives. As the grown children start their own families, parents become grandpar-ents and the family relationships are reconfigured again. The final reconfigurationcomes toward the end of the parents’ lives, when the grown children assume more of acaretaking role with their aging parents.
How are generational boundaries negotiated in single-parent families?
When the family therapy pioneers were writing in the 1960s and 1970s, single-parentfamilies were not nearly as common as they are today. Hence their emphasis was onthe more traditional nuclear families. However, as single-parent families make up asignificant fraction of today’s families, we need to consider how to adapt the familysystems concepts to these families. In single-parent families, there is often a looseningof generational boundaries between the single parent and an older child, who may berecruited to serve as a parental helper. This is adaptive as long as the parent remainssolidly in control and the older child remains in the role of the child and is not recastinto a co-parent. Likewise, the child should not be cast in the role of substitutespouse, responsible to meet the emotional needs of the parent.
252Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 252There is also likely to be more involvement of extended family members with sin-
gle-parent families. This can be an extremely important source of support for the fam-
ily, but also raises issues about the boundaries of control, involvement, and decision-making power between the parent and the grandparents, aunts, uncles, etc., whocontribute to the upbringing of the children. For example, how much does a youngsingle mother make her own decisions about her children and how much does shebow to the advice of her mother?
DIVORCE
How has the frequency of divorce changed over the last few decades?
Two generations ago, divorce was fairly rare and even considered a source of embar-rassment and shame. With the massive social changes of the 1960s and 1970s, particu-larly the women’s movement and the sexual revolution, the cultural attitude towarddivorce shifted dramatically. The social stigma of divorce more or less disappeared andchildren of divorced parents were no longer marked by shame. In the 1970s the divorcerate shot up, peaking in the late 1970s and early 1980s. By 1990, it was predicted that50 percent of all marriages would end in divorce. While the divorce rate has come downin the past twenty years, divorce is still extremely common. In 2004, 25.4 percent offorty-year-old men and 30 percent of forty-year-old women had been divorced.
How have the U.S. divorce rates changed over the last half century?
The table below lists the percentage of 30-year-old adults who have ever been divorced,based on U.S. Census data. Note how the divorce rate increases from the 1960s into themid 1980s but steadily declines from then on. This effect appears to be separate from thedeclining marriage rate. In other words, we cannot say that there are fewer divorces sim-ply because there are fewer marriages. While the marriage rate for 30 year olds steadilydeclined across the same period, the divorce rate clearly peaked before it declined.

One of the most potent predictors of divorce is the age of marriage. According to a
1990 U.S. Census report, couples married before the age of thirty were more likely toget divorced than those married at thirty or older. In fact, this worked in a step-wisefashion. Women married before age twenty had a higher rate of divorce than thosemarried from age twenty to twenty-four, who in turn had a higher divorce rate thanthose married between ages twenty-five to twenty-nine. Whether a baby was conceivedor born before the marriage also contributed to the divorce rate, such that coupleswho conceived or gave birth after marriage were less likely to get divorced. Other riskfactors for divorce include financial instability, distant or acrimonious relationshipswith the extended family, and lack of positive marital role models.
What kind of relationship problems contribute to divorce?
Lack of warmth and affection and poor conflict management in a marriage increasethe likelihood of divorce. It is not so much the amount of conflict that puts a marriageat risk. Rather it is the nature of conflict. As mentioned above in the section on mar-riage, a 1993 study of marital interaction by John Gottman found that couples whodisplayed high levels of defensiveness, contempt, stonewalling, and criticism, as wellas facial expressions of disgust were more likely to end up separated or divorced sever-al years later.
What is the psychological impact of divorce?
Divorce entails tremendous loss and, like any loss, stimulates a grieving process.When people get divorced, they not only lose the marriage—one of the most intenseand intimate relationships of their lives—they also lose much of their married life.Most importantly, divorced parents can no longer live full time with their children,and co-parenting, custody, and visitation issues are perhaps the most stressful andconflictual issues in a divorce. There are also added financial pressures, becauseincomes that supported one household now must support two. When people getdivorced, they lose the social life they shared as a couple, as well as their identity aspart of a married couple or part of a family. Not surprisingly, research shows an elevat-ed rate of depression, physical illness, and even suicide among divorced people, partic-ularly divorced men.
How long does it take people to recover from a divorce?
For most people, life returns to some sort of normalcy within a few years. People getover the acute grieving process, and depression, hostility, and regret subside. Peopleadapt to the new routines of child custody and build new relationships with new part-ners. However, lingering feelings of hostility and of difficulty accepting the end of the
254Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 254relationship may persist even five to ten years after the end of the marriage. A small
percentage of divorced people may harbor strong negative feelings, such as anger,depression, and regret even more than a decade later.
What factors contribute to a hostile and acrimonious divorce?
Given the inherently antagonistic nature of divorce, the chances of the process degener-ating into a hostile battle are quite high. It takes considerable willpower to contain one’snegative feelings and move through the divorce in a civil manner. One or both partnersare leaving the marriage in the first place due to their dissatisfaction with it. If one part-ner initiated the divorce, the spouse who is left behind may have strong feelings ofbetrayal and abandonment. Secondly, there is the division of property and finances. Thisis an area rife for disagreement and conflict. Thirdly, if there are children, decisionsaround custody arrangements frequently elicit strong feelings. Parents may feel greatloss at having to sacrifice time spent with their children. Unfortunately, parents oftencontaminate their co-parenting arrangements with their anger at each other.
What are the processes involved with adjusting to divorce?
The establishment of a clear divorce agreement and custody arrangement marks animportant step in adjusting to divorce. Some psychologists suggest the antagonisticnature of the legal system increases conflict between divorcing couples. Nonetheless,
255THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE: LOVE, MARRIAGE, AND THE BABY CARRIAGE
Next to a death in the family, divorce is one of the most traumatic of life events. Steps should be taken to minimize the stres s and
emotional pain that accompanies the end of a marriage ( iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 255it is critical to come up with a binding solution to financial and custody disputes.
Once a legal solution is in place, the rancor generally settles down, although somepeople report ongoing hostility around co-parenting arrangements. Some divorcedcouples establish friendships after their divorce, but this seems to be relatively rare.The most common outcome is a relatively amicable but not overly involved relation-ship. Not surprisingly, couples without children generally have considerably less con-tact after divorce than those with children.
What happens when there is ongoing conflict and hostility?
A percentage of divorced couples maintain a high level of conflict and hostility after thedivorce. Frequently, this involves disputes over co-parenting. Such ongoing hostility isvery psychologically costly, especially for the children. Sometimes continued hostilityleads to disengagement between the non-custodial parent (generally the father) and thechildren. Increased hostility can also keep the partners overly involved with each other.In fact, some researchers believe that ongoing conflict reflects the partners’ inability toaccept the end of the relationship, as if it is better to have negative contact than none atall. In both cases, ongoing hostility is harmful for all involved, and divorced couplesbenefit by finding ways to reduce hostility and to resolve conflict in healthier ways.
What impact does divorce have on children?
Clearly divorce has a large impact on the children. There is some disagreement in theresearch literature as to how much of an impact it makes. Is it a transient stressor thatwill lose its negative impact after the children and parents adjust to their new life? Ordoes divorce cause long term damage? There is a fair amount of data that shows thatover time, children of divorce do not look much different from children of marriedcouples on many psychological measures. However, there is also data that show chil-dren do exhibit an increase of emotional and behavioral difficulties when their parentsget divorced. It is therefore useful to ask what factors are protective for children ofdivorce and what factors are most harmful.
How can parents best protect their children’s emotional health
during a divorce?
There is no way for a child to be entirely protected from the dislocations and lossesinherent in divorce. When a family breaks up the child is pulled out of an intact familyand will necessarily spend less time with one or both parents. Often there are majorchanges in the child’s life; there may be a move to a new house or a new school. Theremay be new babysitting arrangements. The parents are going through a highly chal-lenging time and it is very difficult to fully shield the children from the parents’ upsand downs. However, most children will eventually adjust if they can maintain close
256Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 256relationships with both parents and if the parents can control their anger and hostility
and learn to cooperate in the raising of their children. In order to thrive, childrenneed love, predictability, and stability. Children are best protected against the negativeimpact of divorce when both parents remain committed to providing a safe and stableenvironment for their children, regardless of their feelings for each other.
What behaviors are most damaging to children during a divorce?
In a 2000 paper, Mary Whiteside and Betsy Jane Becker analyzed the research literatureon children of divorce. They found that the child’s adjustment was impacted both by therelationship with each parent and by the parents’ relationship with one another. Forexample, both a positive father-child relationship and maternal warmth predicted to achild’s well-being. However, the degree of cooperation and hostility between parents alsoinfluenced the child’s emotional adaptation. Moreover, the relationship between the par-ents affected their behavior toward their children. In sum, a hostile, non-cooperativerelationship between divorced parents has a long-term, destructive effect on children.
What are some common mistakes that parents make during a divorce?
Although most parents assume they will only act in the best interest of their children,in the heat of the divorce many parents act against their better judgment. Based onthe clinical and research literature, here is a list of what not to do. In short, do not tri-angulate your child into your battle with your spouse.

257THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE: LOVE, MARRIAGE, AND THE BABY CARRIAGEHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 257How important is it to stay together for the children’s sake?
Most research shows that children benefit from divorce when their parents’ mar-
riage was highly acrimonious or when there was domestic violence, severe alco-holism, or other highly problematic behavior. Not all marriages are worth saving.However, given that the divorce rate reached an estimated peak of 50 percent by1990, it is reasonable to conclude that many of those marriages could have beensaved if both partners had been more committed to working out problems and per-severing through the hard times. As there are clear negative effects of divorce forboth adults and children, we can conclude that divorce should not be taken lightly.Couples should try to save their marriages; they should work on improved conflictresolution and seek out couples’ therapy if necessary. However, these efforts may notsucceed and couples may choose to end their marriage anyway. If parents decide ondivorce, it is incumbent on them to proceed through the divorce process in athoughtful and emotionally controlled way. If they do not, they cause unnecessaryemotional pain for their children.
SEXUALITY
What do we mean by sexuality?
Before exploring the research on sexuality, it is important to clarify what we mean bythe term. Here we will define the word very broadly. Sexuality refers to all thoughts,feelings, and behaviors associated with sexual arousal. This includes sexual fantasies,sexual orientation, the physiology of sexual arousal, and actual sexual behavior.
What is sexology?
Sexology is the systematic study of sex and sexuality. Although there were many schol-ars of sexuality in the nineteenth century—some of the most famous are Richard vonKrafft-Ebbing, Havelock Ellis, and Sigmund Freud—most of these investigators werephysicians and were concerned with illness and pathology. There were many studies ofperversions—what we now call paraphilias. It was not until the middle of the twenti-eth century that sexology included large-scale studies of normal sexuality. Most peoplecredit Alfred Kinsey with pioneering the systematic and empirical study of normal sex-uality in the twentieth century. William Masters and Virginia Johnson followed a fewdecades later with a revolutionary emphasis on sex therapy. Their innovation was toapply the principles of behavioral therapy to improve sexual functioning and enjoy-ment. Current sexologists study normal and atypical patterns of sexual behavior,desire, and attractions and address biological, psychological, relational, and societalinfluences on sexual health.
258Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 258Why is it so difficult to talk about sex?
Sex is a universal part of life and is absolutely integral to our survival as a species.
Nonetheless, sex is an extremely difficult and controversial topic to talk about. Manywould argue that the scientific study of sexuality lags far behind scientific study ofmany other areas of human behavior. We do know that sexuality involves great pas-sion and the relinquishment of everyday normal inhibitions. In the heat of sexual pas-sion, people can violate critical social rules and betray important relationships. Prob-ably because of this, all societies develop codes to regulate sexual behavior. Cultural,religious, and moral codes explicitly state when, where, and what kind of sexualbehavior is socially acceptable. Breaking social rules about sexual behavior can bringsevere consequences, even death in some cultures. It is possible that the evolutionaryimportance of sexuality may contribute to the intense emotional reaction most peoplehave about the topic. In other words, people feel so strongly about sexuality because itis so central to our evolutionary survival.
Who was Alfred Kinsey?
Alfred Kinsey (1894–1956) was one of the pioneering sexologists of the twentieth centu-ry. Born into a devout Methodist family with a strict, repressive father, Kinsey’s quest tobring human sexuality out of the closetand into the open, non-judgmental lightof scientific inquiry was partly fueled byhis own childhood experiences. He origi-nally started his career as an entomologist,a student of insects. The obsessive atten-tion to detail he put into the cataloging ofmillions of insect specimens carried overinto his work in sexology. In 1947, heestablished the Kinsey Institute forResearch in Sex, Gender and Reproduc-tion, which is still in existence today. The2004 movie Kinsey, written and directedby Bill Condon, portrayed the dramaticinterplay between the personal and profes-sional life of this influential figure.
How important is sex to a
healthy relationship?
Most sexologists agree that a healthy andsatisfying sexual life is very important toromantic relationships. Moreover, it pro-
259THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE: LOVE, MARRIAGE, AND THE BABY CARRIAGE
Most people credit Alfred Kinsey with pioneering the
systematic and empirical study of normal sexuality in thetwentieth century (AP/ WideWorld).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 259motes physical and mental health in both partners. However, couples can vary consid-
erably with regard to the importance of sexuality in their lives. Some couples canmaintain a close and satisfying relationship with little sexual activity. For many othercouples, sexual intimacy is an important part of the relationship and disruptions tosexual life can either cause relationship problems or be a symptom of them. It is alsoimportant to note that sexual activity generally decreases with age, particularly in thelast few decades of life. Because of this, older couples may place far less emphasis onsexual intimacy than do younger couples. Nonetheless, there are many older couplesfor whom sexual satisfaction is still important. As the elderly population increases andmore people stay physically and mentally vigorous late into their life, it is likely thatthe topic of geriatric sexuality will gain more attention.
Do men and women differ with regard to sexuality?
In William Masters and Virginia Johnson’s pioneering work on human sexuality in the1960s and 1970s, it was assumed that the sexual response worked the same for both menand women. All people followed the four stages of sexual arousal: excitement, plateau,orgasm, and resolution. More recent work has shown that men and women differ dra-matically in the nature of their sexuality. Compared to women, men masturbate more,use more pornography, are more reactive to visual cues, and experience sexual desiremore spontaneously. Women, on the other hand, are less likely to become spontaneouslysexually aroused and their sexual desire is much more reactive to their surrounding cir-cumstances. For example, the quality of a woman’s relationship with a potential sexualpartner greatly affects her feelings of sexual attraction. In this way, science supports thecliché that women like to be wined and dined and men like sexy outfits.
What does Roy Baumeister propose with regard to gender differences
in sexuality?
In a 2000 article, Roy Baumeister proposed that sexuality varies fundamentallybetween women and men. Men, he suggested, have a fixed, biologically determined sexdrive that is relatively insensitive to context. Women, on the other hand, have a muchmore variable sex drive, far more responsive to the surrounding circumstances. Hebased these conclusions on a broad range of empirical findings. According to thisresearch, women have greater variation both in the level of sexual activity and choiceof gender over time. Moreover, in women sexuality is far more influenced by culturalfactors, such as education, religion, and peer and parental attitudes.
What are the most common sexual complaints of women?
The sexual complaints most frequently encountered by sex therapists involve prob-lems with sexual arousal, lack of sexual desire, pain during intercourse, and lack of
260Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 260orgasm. These complaints often co-
occur; they are not necessarily separatefrom each other. Interestingly, a numberof studies show that a woman’s physio-logical response (e.g., blood flow to thegenitals and vaginal lubrication) may notalways correspond to her subjective senseof sexual arousal. While some physiologi-cal response may occur quite easily, theconscious sense of sexual excitement ismuch more tied to a woman’s emotionalstate. Feelings of depression, anxiety, andemotional distance can dampen sexualdesire while feelings of relaxation andintimacy heighten it. Negative emotionscan be in response to current situations,but also a result of long-term emotionaldifficulties related to sex.
What are the most common sexual complaints of men?
The most frequent sexual complaints made by men include erectile dysfunction,rapid ejaculation, and delayed ejaculation. Men can also complain of lack of sexualdesire. Erectile dysfunction and ejaculatory difficulty generally increase with ageand may relate to the reduced testosterone levels associated with aging. Sexualdesire decreases with age as well, although this does not have to be a problem ifboth partners are satisfied with their sexual life. Medical conditions, such as heartdisease and diabetes, can also interfere with sexual function in men. These condi-tions become more frequent with age, but are also impacted by health behaviors,such as alcoholism, smoking, diet, and exercise. Emotional factors play a role aswell, including depression, stress, and relationship problems. A range of deep-seatedconflicts about sexuality, stemming from important childhood relationships, canfurther complicate sexual function.
How does anxiety interfere with sexual functioning?
There is clear indication that anxiety about sexual performance or experience can havean immediate and profound effect on sexual functioning. Many studies show that awoman’s sexual excitement and pleasure is tied to feelings of relaxation. Fear of vagi-nal dryness, pain, or lack of response can immediately dampen a woman’s sexualarousal. Likewise in men, fear of erectile dysfunction can create a vicious circle, inwhich anxiety about impotence can cause men to lose their erection, which in turnreinforces their anxiety.

For many couples sexual intimacy is an important part of the
relationship. Disruptions to sexual life can either causerelationship problems or be a symptom of them ( iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 261What role does conditioning play in sexual response?
In associative or classical conditioning, people learn to respond to a situation in a particu-
lar way because they associate that situation with something that elicits the sameresponse. For example, you might feel disgust at the thought of eating chicken if you gotsick one time after eating rotten chicken. Conditioning plays a very important role in sex-ual response for both men and women. Expectations of failure, of discomfort, or of lack ofresponse can dampen sexual arousal. Likewise positive expectations of pleasure andexcitement can heighten sexual response. That is why classical conditioning techniquesare incorporated into sex therapy. Sex therapists work to break the association betweensexual activity and stress, performance anxiety or discomfort. They aim to replace suchnegative associations with positive associations of pleasure, comfort, and intimacy.
What roles do hormones play in sexual response?
There is considerable evidence that the male hormone, testosterone, plays an importantrole in sexual arousal. It seems to be more important in the sexual functioning of menthan women, however. In women, the hormone estrogen affects sexual function, pro-moting vaginal lubrication and elasticity. After menopause, estrogen levels drop off dra-matically in women, causing vaginal dryness and sometimes pain during intercourse.Hormone replacement therapy, which increases the level of estrogen, can moderatethese negative effects although there are safety problems associated with long-term use.
How important is sexual communication ?
Most sex therapists place considerable importance on sexual communication, whichcan be surprisingly poor in many couples. Many people assume that sexual needs andpreferences should not have to be explicitly stated and thus shy away from direct com-munication. Some women are embarrassed to directly state their desires, fearing theywould appear unseemly or critical of their partner. Likewise, many men feel pressureto know how to please a woman without necessarily being told. Enhancing sexualcommunication between partners can be a quick and easy way to improve the qualityof a couple’s sexual life.
What are the most effective treatments for sexual problems?
With the arrival of sildenafil citrate (Viagra) in 1998, medical treatments for sexual prob-lems have become more prominent. Viagra improves erectile function by increasing geni-tal blood flow. This is accomplished through a type of chemical called the PDE5 (phospho-diesterase type 5) inhibitors. Several other drugs of the same class have been developedthat are also effective with erectile dysfunction. Unfortunately, no similar drugs have beenfound to help women. Premature ejaculation is treated with the SSRIs, a class of antide-pressants that work on the serotonin system (e.g., fluoxetine [Prozac] or paroxetine
262Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 262[Paxil]). Hormone treatments, which increase the levels of testosterone and/or estrogen,
have also been tried but they have shown limited effectiveness and can have dangerousside effects. When treating sexual dysfunction, however, it is still critical to address psycho-logical issues, which may include patients’ attitudes toward sexuality as well as their bodyimage, feelings of vulnerability, and/or performance anxiety. Couples’ issues are alsoextremely important, and can involve emotional distance, poor communication, unre-solved conflict, and mutual misunderstandings about each partner’s sexual needs.
What is sensate focus?
Sensate focus is a specific behavioral technique that is used when there is considerableanxiety and stress associated with sex. In order to help people relax and learn to enjoysexual intimacy, it is often useful to forbid them to actually engage in sexual activity.This takes the pressure off, removing the problem of performance anxiety or fear ofdiscomfort. Instead, couples are instructed to express physical affection in nonsexualways until they are completely relaxed. From there, they slowly increase sexual con-tact, moving in very small steps. In this way, negative associations are extinguished, tobe replaced with positive associations. This technique has been highly successful witha wide range of sexual dysfunctions.
How do values about sexuality vary across cultures?
Cultures vary dramatically in their approaches toward sexuality. Some cultures areextremely sensual, but very restrictive about the conditions in which sexuality can beexpressed. For example, many aspects of Muslim culture celebrate sensuality, but ortho-dox Islam is adamant about segregation of the sexes and the covering of women’s bodiesin public. Likewise, in orthodox Judaism, a husband is obligated to make love to his wifealthough women must cover their hair in public, and unrelated men and women cannotshake hands. Other cultures are restrictive about any aspect of sexuality, devaluing it asdecadent and sinful. St. Augustine (354–430 
C.E.), the early Christian theologian, wrote
with great disgust about fleshly desire. Likewise, Alfred Kinsey (1894–1956) was partiallymotivated to study sexuality in response to the sexually repressive Christianity he expe-rienced in his childhood. In contrast, other cultures are far more liberal about sexualexpression. In many ancient cultures, sexual acts were incorporated into religious ritu-als. Phallic processions were often used in the worship of Dionysus, the Greek God ofwine. These are parades in which a large phallic statue is carried by the participants ofthe parade. Similar processions have been found in Japan and other countries. Theseserved as fertility celebrations, which were common in early agrarian societies.
How do cultures vary with regard to attitudes about female sexuality?
As with general attitudes toward sexuality, attitudes about female sexuality vary widelyacross cultures. Some attempt to control female sexuality is extremely widespread,
263THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE: LOVE, MARRIAGE, AND THE BABY CARRIAGEHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 263however, ranging from social mores about “good girls” who “wait until marriage”
(common in the United States throughout the 1960s), all the way to clitorendectomiesand honor killings. Clitorendectomies, which are practiced in parts of Africa and theMiddle East, involve the surgical removal of the clitoris, the part of a woman’s genitalscontaining the bulk of sensory nerve endings. Removal of the clitoris greatly reduces awoman’s capacity for sexual pleasure. Honor killings involve the murder of any femalewho brings shame onto her family through inappropriate sexual activity—whether ornot she was a willing participant in such activity.
Is there an evolutionary function to controlling women’s sexuality ?
The remarkable pervasiveness of attempts to control female sexuality suggests itserves an evolutionary function, possibly the protection of paternity. While a mothercan be very confident that her children are her own, men can never be 100 percentpositive of their children’s paternity. Controlling his partner’s sexual freedomenhances a father’s confidence (and that of his relatives) in the paternity of the chil-dren he is raising. Similar behavior is found in the mate-guarding of prairie voles and
other animal species.
264What are some ways in which cultures differ
regarding sexual behavior and taboos?
While all cultures have some code by which they regulate sexual behavior,attitudes toward sexuality and sexual permissiveness vary tremendously
across cultures. For one, the degree to which bodily exposure is socially accept-able differs widely. American law generally prevents public exposure of women’sbreasts or of either sex’s genitals. In contrast, women sunbathe topless in manyEuropean countries. In orthodox Judaism, married women cover their hairwhen in public so as not to excite sexual desire in men who are not their hus-bands. Similar patterns are found in many Muslim countries in which womenmust cover their hair and most of their body when out in public.
There is also wide cultural variation in attitudes toward homosexuality.
In many cultures, homosexuality is considered sinful and morally unaccept-able. In other cultures, homosexuality is considered a normal rite of passage.Both in ancient Greece and in the Sambia tribe of Papua New Guinea, homo-sexual relations between young boys and older males were considered a nor-mal part of development. In the United States today, the subject remainsintensely controversial, with some people accepting homosexuality as a nor-mal part of human sexuality and others still finding it religiously and morallyobjectionable.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 264How have values about sexuality in industrialized Western societies changed
over the past several decades?
There have been many cultural changes in industrialized Western societies since the
end of the 1960s, but the attitudes toward sexuality have undergone some of the mostmarked transformations. In general, attitudes toward sexuality have become dramati-cally more open, relaxed, and liberal. Premarital sex, masturbation, homosexuality,and the use of sexual aids are now commonly accepted practices when they used to besocially frowned upon if not actually illegal. Likewise, public discussion of sex is nolonger considered taboo. Advertisements for the treatment of erectile dysfunctiongrace the pages of weekly magazines, and fairly graphic depictions of sexual encoun-ters are easily found on cable television. For people born in the last few decades, itmay be hard to appreciate the sea change in cultural mores that this represents. Alook at television shows from the 1950s may help illustrate the magnitude of thisshift. To the extent that the bedroom was shown at all in these programs, married cou-ples slept in separate twin beds.
SEXUAL ORIENTATION
What is sexual orientation?
In recent years there has been a considerable increase in the research into sexual ori-entation. With this work has come much controversy as to the nature, stability, andeven existence of sexual orientation. For our purposes, sexual orientation refers to thegender toward which a person’s characteristic patterns of sexual attractions, fantasies,and behavior are oriented. It is important to consider someone’s sexual attractionsand fantasies in addition to their sexual behavior because external constraints havemore direct influence on behavior than on internal psychological processes. Forexample, men in prison who have no access to women may engage in sex with othermen even though their primary attraction is to women. Likewise, people may marry

What are some examples of sexual euphemisms
that were used in Victorian England?
In Victorian England, it was so taboo to speak openly about sex in “respectablecompany,” that the language became rife with euphemisms. Two particularly
striking turns of phrase involved the substitution of “white meat” for chickenbreast and piano “limb” for piano leg.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 265because of social expectations although
their primary sexual desires and fantasiesinvolve members of the same sex.
Is sexual orientation a category or
a continuum ?
There is some controversy in theresearch literature as to whether sexualorientation exists as discrete categoriesor as a continuum. In other words, canwe classify people into heterosexual,homosexual, or bisexual categories or dopeople vary along a continuum rangingfrom heterosexual to homosexual?Although there is a fair amount of evi-dence that people do not fall intoabsolute categories and some capacityfor bisexual feelings, thoughts, or behav-ior exists in many people, there is otherevidence that most people fall largely onone or the other side of the continuum.Recent studies suggest, however, thatthis distinction may be more clear-cutfor men than for women.
What is the Kinsey scale?
Alfred Kinsey saw sexual orientation as falling on a continuum. He published a scalein 1948 which is still in use today. This seven-point scale ranges from 0 = exclusivelyheterosexual to 6 = exclusively homosexual. In a study of 4,506 subjects published in2000 by Steven Gangestad, Michael Bailey, and Nicholas Martin, 5 percent of men andabout 3 percent of women scored three or above on the Kinsey scale. About 9 percentof men and 19 percent of women scored a 1 or 2 on the scale. That left about 85 per-cent of the men and 78 percent of the women to score 0 = exclusively heterosexual.
What did a 2000 study of men and women show about sexual orientation?
The data in the table below is drawn from a 2000 study by Steven Gangestad and col-leagues, in which 1,759 men and 2,747 females were rated on the Kinsey Scale of sex-ual orientation. As you can see, the vast majority of subjects were rated as exclusivelyheterosexual, but 15% of men and 22% of women reported some degree of homosexu-

while women are more likely to fall in the middle.

How prevalent is homosexuality?
Estimates of the prevalence of homosexuality vary, but range somewhere between 3percent and 13 percent, depending on the definition of homosexuality used. The num-ber of people engaging in homosexual behavior is likely much smaller than the num-ber of people experiencing homosexual attraction or fantasies. In a 1995 study by Ran-dall Sell, James Wells, and David Wypij, about 3 percent of females and between 5percent to 11 percent of men across the United States, the United Kingdom, andFrance reported homosexual behavior in the past five years. About 8 percent of malesand 10 percent of females reported homosexual attraction but not behavior since agefifteen. Combining measures of attraction and behavior, about 18 percent of both menand women reported either homosexual attraction or behavior since the age of fifteen.
What are the causes of homosexuality?
Not surprisingly, there is considerable controversy over the causes of homosexuality. Thisis partly because the issue is very complex and partly because of the political implicationsof the question. There is a fair amount of evidence of a biological basis for homosexuality,at least for some people. Three biological models of homosexuality consider prenatal hor-mones, brain anatomy, and genetic influences. There is also support for social, psycholog-ical, and situational factors that contribute to homosexual feelings or behaviors.
What is the neurohormonal theory of homosexuality?
According to the neurohormonal theory, exposure to prenatal sex hormones influ-ences sexual orientation in adulthood. Evidence for this comes from animal studies
267THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE: LOVE, MARRIAGE, AND THE BABY CARRIAGEHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 267that show animals exposed to abnormal levels (either too high or too low) of andro-
gens in utero can show behavior typical of the opposite sex. Additional evidencecomes from studies of girls with a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia(CAH), which results in exposure to high levels of androgens both in the womb andimmediately after birth. Women with CAH report elevated levels of typically mascu-line interests and activities, and increased frequency of homosexual or bisexual fan-tasies and behavior.
What are other biological theories of homosexuality?
There is also some evidence of subtle brain differences between homosexual and het-erosexual men. In 1991, Simon LeVay published work suggesting that a certain partof the hypothalamus, the region of the brain that controls hormone function, may besmaller in homosexual men than in heterosexual men. His study has been criticizedhowever, because many of his homosexual subjects were HIV positive. The geneticcomponent of homosexuality has also been explored, largely through twin studies.The correspondence in sexual orientation between identical and fraternal twins givesinformation as to the genetic heritability of sexual orientation. If identical twins aremore similar in their sexual orientation than fraternal twins, this suggests thatgenetics play an important role (because identical twins share 100 percent of theirgenes while fraternal twins share only 50 percent). The evidence for this has beenmixed. Some studies show a strong genetic influence while others do not. It is possi-ble that the genetic influence is most powerful in people who are strongly, if notexclusively, homosexual. Genetics may be less important in people with milderhomosexual tendencies.
What are some of the non-biological causes of homosexuality?
As societies dramatically vary in their attitudes toward homosexuality, we have toassume that cultural attitudes toward homosexuality will affect the prevalence ofhomosexual behavior. While some people with strong homosexual desires will likelyact on them regardless of cultural mores, it is likely that people with milder homosex-ual tendencies will be more influenced by their cultural context, inhibiting or explor-ing their desires according to notions of what is acceptable. The availability of hetero-sexual partners also affects the likelihood of homosexual behavior. In rigidlysex-segregated settings, such as prison, homosexual behavior is quite frequent.
So far, we have addressed the social influences on sexual behavior , not feelings,
fantasies, or desire. Recent research suggests that for women more than for men, sex-ual attraction often follows feelings of intimacy. In this case, sexual desire is influ-enced by the quality of the relationship. Likewise, in some cases, painful, negativerelationships with members of the opposite sex can turn people away from heterosex-uality and toward the same sex.
268Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 268How does gender-typical behavior relate to sexual orientation?
Michael Bailey and colleagues have conducted a series of studies looking at the rela-
tionship between gender nonconforming behavior and sexual orientation. By gender
nonconforming behavior, Bailey means interests, activities, toys, and even body move-ments that are associated with the opposite sex (e.g., girls who play football, boys whoplay with dolls). A number of studies show that gay and bisexual men and womenrecall a higher degree of gender nonconforming behavior than do their heterosexualcounterparts. However, these retrospective studies may be biased by selective recall.
Prospective studies are really needed. In that vein, a study of childhood home videos
supported a relationship between gender nonconforming behavior in childhood andhomosexual tendencies in adulthood. It is important to note, however, that there wasa lot of variation among these subjects and not all children with gender nonconform-ing behavior grew up to be homosexual and not all adults with homosexual tendenciesshowed gender nonconforming behavior in childhood.
Do men and women differ with regards to sexual orientation?
An explosion of research into female sexuality supports the notion that sexual orienta-tion in women is different from that in men. Men seem to be more categorical in theirsexual orientation; they are more likely to be either heterosexual or homosexual.Women, on the other hand, tend to be more flexible in their sexual orientation, lesscategorically heterosexual or homosexual. This is supported by studies using the Kin-sey scale, in which women are more likely than men to fall in the middle of the scale,while men are more likely to fall on either end.
Fascinating new studies of the physiological response of men and women to vari-
ous sexual images adds support to this theory. Meredith Chivers, Michael Seto, andRay Blanchard measured genital response to different sexual images. While physiolog-ical response in men was, for the most part, oriented toward either adult women or
men, women responded sexually to a much broader range of images. In fact, womenhad a (small) physiological response to images of bonobo chimps mating. Moreover,the physical response in women was often at odds with their verbal descriptions. Inother words, what women said they responded to did not always correspond to theiractual physiological arousal.
These findings are consistent with the distinction mentioned earlier between the
physiological responses in women and their conscious emotional experience. Thesefindings also align with Baumeister’s theory that sexuality in men tends to be relative-ly fixed and unvarying while sexuality in women is more fluid and more responsive tosituational factors.

Why study happiness?
Traditionally, psychology has devoted far more attention to negative emotions than to
positive emotions. Perhaps because of the medical origins of clinical psychology, psy-chological research has concentrated on healing the sick and reducing suffering. Whileit is hard to argue with those aims, this focus has meant that the study of happinessand of positive emotion has been relatively neglected until recently. So why study hap-piness? Well, if all we do is reduce sadness and relieve depression, then the goals of lifebecome no more than the absence of misery. Surely, we would all like more from ourlives than that. By studying happiness and positive emotion, psychology can learn howpeople can best enhance their life and work towards fulfillment and self-development.
What is happiness?
How do we define happiness? Happiness can be defined as a mental state characterizedby consistently positive emotions. Positive emotions can include curiosity, joy, con-tentment, excitement, interest, and/or pleasure. Life satisfaction is also considered inmany happiness studies. Most researchers are more interested in the effects of chronic
happiness, or the ongoing propensity to experience positive mood, than in the imme-diate effects of a momentary happy feeling.
What function does happiness serve?
Happiness researchers believe that positive emotions signal to us that we are in goodshape. Our needs are being met, we have adequate resources, and we are reaching our
271
THE PSYCHOLOGY

MOTIVATION AND THESEARCH FOR HAPP INESSHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 271goals. Positive emotional states also encourage people to engage with the environ-
ment, to seek out and take on new goals. We can contrast the effects of positive emo-tions with those of negative emotions, such as depression or fear. These emotions sig-nal to the individual that something is not right, that the environment is not safe, andthat the best course of action is withdrawal and avoidance.
How much does the intensity of happiness matter?
Apparently, the consistency of positive emotions matters more than the intensity of them.
In a 1991 study by Ed Diener and colleagues, the proportion of time that people felt posi-tive emotions was a better predictor of their evaluation of their overall happiness than theintensity of their positive emotions. In other words, happy people tend to feel mildly ormoderately happy most of the time, but may not feel intensely happy all that often.
How do we measure happiness?
Because happiness is a subjective state, the only way to directly measure happiness is toask people how they feel. There may be physiological indications of positive mood, suchas low levels of stress hormones, but there are no objective measures of happiness per se.Self-report measures pose a number of problems, however. People may not always knowexactly how they feel. Alternatively, they may bias their reports according to how theywant to see themselves or what they feel is socially desirable. Nonetheless, self-reports ofhappiness have yielded meaningful data in a large body of research. Researchers also dis-tinguish between rating overall happiness (How happy are you in general?) and trackingmoment-by-moment emotional states. The second type of rating allows researchers toconnect emotional reactions to the specific activities people are engaging in at the time.
What does happiness do?
Certainly many things can make us happy (or unhappy), but a consistently positivemood also brings significant benefits in and of itself. Let us consider what happinessdoes for us. In 2005, Sonja Lyubomirsky, Laura King, and Ed Diener published a meta-analysis on research looking at the relationship between positive mood and life function-ing. They found that people who are generally happy also demonstrate adaptive psycho-logical traits, such as optimism, resilience in the face of frustration, and enhanced goalseeking. In other words, happy people are upbeat, resilient go-getters. These traits inturn are related to a wealth of positive outcomes, including increased popularity, socialengagement, pro-social (helpful) behavior, coping skills, and even physical health.
What effect does happiness have on our health?
How can we tell if happiness leads to better health? Any study of this question isplagued by the chicken and egg problem. Which came first, happiness or good health?
272Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 272There are many studies showing cross-sectional correlations between happiness and
health. In other words, at any given point people who are happier are also healthier.
While these studies show a clear relationship between positive mood and physicalhealth, we cannot know which came first. Unlike cross-sectional studies, however, lon-gitudinal studies can show whether high levels of positive mood actually precede
healthy outcomes. For example, in a recent study of five thousand people, high levelsof positive mood predicted to fewer hospitalizations five years later and a lower inci-dence of stroke six years later.
What effect does happiness have on our social life?
The chicken-egg problem also applies to studies on happiness and social relationships.Many cross-sectional studies show strong correlations between happiness and success-ful friendships, marriages, and family relationships. Longitudinal studies, however,demonstrate that the tendency toward happiness precedes strong relationships. In
other words, happy people are more likely to get married, have successful marriages,and even have more friends. For example, in an Australian study carried out over fif-teen years by Gary Marks and Nicole Fleming, people who scored high on happinessscales were more likely to be married in the following years than those who did not.Similar results have been found with German and American samples. Moreover, a 1989study published by Bruce Headey and Ruut Veenhoven showed that happiness levelspredicted quality of marriage. Over a six-year period, people with higher levels of happi-ness earlier in the study were more likely to have a happy marriage later in the study.
What effect does happiness have on our work life?
Does research show the same effect of happiness on our work life? Here too, mostresearch is cross-sectional. Thus, at any given time people with high levels of positivemood tend to have better jobs, higher income, and more autonomous and meaningfulwork than less happy people. Obviously, the chicken-and-egg problem is relevant here aswell. Certainly, many people (if not most) have experienced the negative emotional

What is a meta-analysis?
Ameta-analysis is a statistical analysis of a group of different studies. It is a
way of examining the effect of one variable on another variable across a
whole body of literature—and not just a single study. For example, if we want tolook at the effect of happiness on coping skills, we can perform a meta-analysison all the available studies on this topic in order to determine the overall effect

information than data from individual studies.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 273274effects of working at an unpleasant job at some point in their lives. Longitudinal
research, however, shows that high levels of positive emotion early in life predicts occu-pational and financial success many years later. For example, Ed Diener and colleaguesfound in a 2002 study that college students who displayed more cheerfulness in theirfirst year of college made more money sixteen years later than did their less cheerfulcounterparts. This effect was found regardless of family income. In fact, the effect wasparticularly pronounced with students from higher-income families. Presumably, thesestudents had fewer barriers to occupational success than students from lower-incomefamilies. Consequently, their emotional state had that much more influence.
What does and does not lead to happiness?
Clearly our mood is not simply a function of our own personalities. We are also sub-ject to the circumstances in which we find ourselves and the effects of our own choic-es. What kinds of things truly contribute to sustained happiness and which do not?
The research on what makes us happy is far more complicated than the literature
on the benefits of happiness–on what happiness does for us. The earlier happinessresearchers were quite pessimistic about the degree of control we have over our ownhappiness, assuming that we can do little to affect our happiness in any sustainableway. Later researchers had a far more optimistic view, however, suggesting that ouractivities and circumstances can definitely impact our general level of happiness.
What is the happiness set point?
In the early 1970s Phillip Brickman and Donald Campbell introduced the notion of thehappiness set point . In this view, our general level of happiness is genetically deter-
mined and largely untouched by life events. While significant life events may knock usabove or below our set point, the effect is only temporary and we return to our baselinein relatively short order. Although most happiness researchers have since temperedthis extreme stance, a fair amount of evidence suggests there is some merit to this idea.
What is the evidence supporting the happiness set point?
For one, twin studies suggest there is a large genetic component to happiness ratings,suggesting our level of happiness is at least partly pre-wired. In other words, the hap-piness ratings of identical twins, who share 100 percent of their genes, are more simi-lar than those of fraternal twins, who share only 50 percent of their genes. Secondly,external conditions often have little to do with happiness levels. For example, demo-graphic characteristics, such as age, gender, and income, have been shown to haveweak correlations with life satisfaction. Even physical attractiveness has little to dowith happiness. Moreover, research on people suffering negative life events, such asthe loss of a spouse or a disabling accident, pointed to significant recovery in life satis-Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 274How did a 1978 study help support the theory that

275faction over time despite an initial drop in happiness ratings. Likewise, a famous 1978
study of lottery winners by Brickman and colleagues showed little difference in happi-ness ratings between lottery winners and a comparison group.
What is the hedonic treadmill?
The concept of the hedonic treadmill is closely related to the concept of the happiness set
point. If we are destined to return to our happiness set point over time, then positive lifeevents can only give us a temporary lift. People who are constantly in search of a higherstate of happiness may deny this to themselves, repeatedly pursuing temporary pleasuresHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 275as if the effect will not, in fact, be temporary. It is as if they are continuously marching on
a treadmill, thinking they are going forward when they are really staying in place.
What is the current view on the happiness set point?
In a 2005 paper, Ed Diener, Richard Lucas, and Christie Napa Scollon revisited the con-cept of the happiness set point. In their view, external events doaffect our overall sense of
wellbeing—we are not immune to our environment. Nevertheless, over time we do tend
to adapt to our circumstances, both good and bad. Moreover, in a 2007 study by RichardLucas, two fairly large groups of disabled people showed a distinct downturn in their lifesatisfaction following the onset of their disability, with little to no recovery over time.
What factors seem to affect our general level of happiness?
In recent years happiness researchers have looked at several factors that may influ-ence our level of happiness. More specifically, researchers have studied the contribu-tions of genetics, demographic characteristics, interpersonal relationships, money,attitude toward life, and sense of control.
How much do genetics contribute to our level of happiness?
Genetics probably contribute a fair amount to our general level of happiness, up to 50 per-cent according to a 2005 review by Sonja Lyubormirsky, Kennon Sheldon, and DavidSchkade. However, this figure should be considered with some caution. Most geneticstudies use samples that do not vary dramatically in their environment or life circum-stances. When people’s environments are fairly similar, the influence of genetics is height-ened. When there is a broad range of environmental conditions, however, the role of
276How much does our neighbors’ material success
affect our satisfaction with our own possessions?
Money clearly matters to some extent and not having enough money defi-nitely has a negative effect. But we can also ask how much money is
enough? It is likely that social comparison plays some role here. We may be per-fectly happy with our cute little cottage as long as our neighbors and friends livein similar houses. When our peers start moving into spacious mansions, howev-er, we become dissatisfied with what we have. The term “social comparison”refers to the way we evaluate our own belongings through comparison with ourneighbors’ belongings.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 276genetics is less important. Therefore, because most genetic studies do not include samples
from a wide range of environments, the importance of genetics may be exaggerated.
How much do life circumstances contribute to happiness?
According to this same review of the literature by Lyubormirsky and colleagues, lifecircumstances such as income, social status, and demographic characteristics (e.g.,age, gender, ethnicity) matter, but not as much as we might expect, accounting for 10to 20 percent of overall happiness scores. Estimates similar to this have been reportedin other happiness studies.
How important are interpersonal relationships to happiness?
Supportive social relationships likely play a very important role in happiness, judgingby many studies showing strong correlations between these two domains. There isalso a large body of literature attesting to the powerful effect of social support on ourresistance to stress and physical illness, as well as our general wellbeing.
Do our attitudes affect our level of happiness?
Several lines of research point to the importance of the way we engage with life, ineffect, our attitude toward life. Lyubormirsky and colleagues suggest that 40 percentof our overall happiness depends on our active attempts to foster our own happinessthrough our thoughts, activities, and goals. This viewpoint is echoed by Martin Selig-man in his work on positive psychology.
Does money make us happy?
Some research shows that people with higher incomes are happier than those withlower incomes, but other studies suggest that money has little effect on happiness. Aningenious 2006 study by Wendy Johnson and Robert Krueger sheds some light onthese confusing findings. In their view, the objective amount of financial resources is
less important than the subjective perception of financial status. In a study of 719 twin
pairs, Johnson and Krueger found that people’s perception of their financial circum-stances—that is, whether they believed they had enough money—had only a modest
relationship with their actual income and assets. Likewise, their satisfaction with theirlife was far less related to actual prosperity than to perception of prosperity. In otherwords, the degree to which people felt satisfied with their life had less to do with howmuch money they actually had and more to do with their beliefs about how much
money they had—i.e., feeling that they had enough money.
277THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE: MOTIVATION AND THE SEARCH FOR HAPPINESSHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 277Can meditation benefit your health and emotional well being?
Awealth of evidence suggests that
happiness is mediated by an area
of the brain known as the left pre-frontal cortex. The frontal cortextakes up about half of the entire cor-tex, which is the outer covering ofthe brain. The prefrontal cortex isthe most anterior (or forward) part
of the frontal cortex (see Chapter 3for more on brain anatomy). Brainimaging studies, electro-encephalo-gram (EEG) studies, and evenresearch on the effect of strokes allsupport the role of the left prefrontalcortex in positive emotions.
Richard Davidson has conducted
a number of investigations in thisarea. In one 2003 study conducted with John Cabott Zinn and a group of other col-leagues, 25 subjects trained in meditation techniques were compared to a controlgroup who had been put on a wait list. Meditation has been shown to have a strongimpact on positive mood. Study subjects who completed the eight-week course inmeditation showed a much greater increase in electrical activity in the left frontalregions than did wait-listed controls. Moreover, this group also showed a betterimmune response to a flu vaccine they received after their meditation course.

278Is sense of control important?
In Johnson and Krueger’s study, life satisfaction was also strongly related to beliefs
about how much control people felt they had over their life. In fact, out of the twelvefactors studied, perceived control over one’s life was the single most important factorcontributing to life satisfaction.
POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY
What is positive psychology?
Positive psychology is a branch of happiness studies championed by Martin Seligman(1942–). Positive psychology came into its own in 2000, when Seligman was electedHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 278THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE: MOTIVATION AND THE SEARCH FOR HAPPINESS
279president of the American Psychological Association and was in a position to direct the
field’s attention. Unlike previous happiness researchers, Seligman is a staunch believ-er in the ability of each person to improve his or her general emotional well-being. Hisearlier seminal work on learned helplessness contributed to the development of cog-
nitive behavioral therapies for depression. Consequently, Seligman brought a psy-chotherapist’s point of view to the study of positive emotions, asking how psycholo-gists can help people to feel better.
Why is positive psychology a shift from traditional trends in psychology?
Although Seligman has tested his techniques on depressed patients, positive psycholo-gy differs from traditional psychotherapy by its emphasis on happiness and wellbeingrather than on the relief of suffering and mental illness. Seligman is not the first tothink about the human potential for happiness, however, and he acknowledges theinfluence of earlier writers such as Carl Rogers, Abraham Maslow, and Erik Erikson.
What are Seligman’s three aspects of happiness?
Seligman actually rejects the use of the term “happiness,” stating that it is too vagueand unscientific. Instead, he breaks happiness or “the good life” into three compo-nents: positive emotion (the pleasant life), engagement (the engaged life), and mean-ing (the meaningful life).
What does Seligman mean by the pleasant life?
This refers to the experience of high levels of positive emotion regarding our present,past, and future. Positive emotions about our past include feelings of contentment, fulfill-ment, satisfaction, serenity, and pride. Positive emotions about our future include confi-dence, optimism, hope, faith, and trust. Positive emotions about our present include theability to experience pleasure from immediate experience. This also involves the ability toattend to immediate experience and not be distracted by concerns about the future or
past. Interestingly, this aspect of “the good life” appears to be the least important in that ithas the lowest correlations with a person’s ratings of life satisfaction.
What does Seligman mean by the engaged life?
The engaged life involves the ability to invest in and make connections with work,
intimate relationships, and leisure activities. In the engaged life we are not isolatedindividuals, floating on a self-imposed island of alienation, but rather we are activelyengaged with the world around us. Seligman believes that increasing life engagementinvolves identifying signature strengths—one’s own particular strengths and inter-ests—and then putting them to use. For example, people who are interested in art cantake a painting class. Those who like animals can volunteer at an animal shelter.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:02 PM  Page 279What is meant by the meaningful life?
In the meaningful life, people use their signature strengths to commit and contribute
to causes larger themselves. The particular cause does not matter and might includepolitics, religion, community service, or family. In this way, people gain a sense ofbelonging to a larger group, cause, or institution and they enhance their sense of self-worth and life purpose. A series of studies shows the relationship between such com-mitments and life satisfaction. The importance of a meaningful life suggests that a lifedevoted to self-centered aims ultimately provides limited life satisfaction.
Which aspects of happiness are most important?
Multiple studies show that the engaged and meaningful life have stronger positive corre-lations with life satisfaction and stronger negative correlations with depression than doesthe pleasant life, although all three aspects of the good life relate to overall happiness.
How do Seligman’s findings accord with other happiness research?
Seligman’s findings that the pleasant life is least predictive of overall happiness com-pared to the engaged and meaningful life helps explain some of the contradictory find-ings in happiness research. It seems that pleasure, what we feel after we achieve a
desired goal, is most likely to be short-lived. This is consistent with the notion of the
280
Seligman believes that giving back to the larger community is an important part of happiness ( iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 280hedonic treadmill, which presumes that any satisfaction derived from an achieved goal
is bound to be temporary. Our way of engaging with our life, however—whether we
are involved with other people in a meaningful way or meeting our own potential forgrowth—appears to have significant impact on our general happiness. Thus, if wewant to increase our level of happiness, we are better off considering the way we liveour life rather than solely focusing on the pursuit of pleasure.
What are the virtues?
Assuming that happiness has three components (listed above as the pleasant, engaged,and meaningful lives), Seligman and his colleagues believed it was important to iden-tify personality traits that promote these positive modes of living. Consequently, theyidentified six overarching virtues which they claim to be culturally universal. These
are: wisdom and knowledge, courage, humanity (which involves compassion and con-cern for others), justice, temperance (the capacity for self control), and transcendence(the ability to find connections with a larger universe).
What are the character strengths?
The six overarching virtues were broken down into twenty-four character strengths.These included: creativity, curiosity, open-mindedness, love of learning and perspectivefor wisdom and knowledge; authenticity, bravery, persistence, and zest for courage; kind-ness, love, and social intelligence for humanity; fairness, leadership, and teamwork forjustice; forgiveness, modesty, prudence, and self-regulation for temperance; appreciationof beauty and excellence, gratitude, hope, humor, and religiousness for transcendence.
What does Seligman’s research say about the virtues and character strengths?
Seligman and his colleagues have conducted research to see how universal these con-cepts are and how well they correlate with life satisfaction. A study conducted in fortydifferent countries asked people to rate how much they could identify with each of thetwenty-four character strengths. The rankings of the character strengths were notablysimilar from country to country, with kindness, fairness, authenticity, gratitude, andopen-mindedness most commonly endorsed (“most like me”). Less frequentlyendorsed strengths included prudence, modesty, and self-regulation. The authors alsonoted that the strengths pertaining to emotional traits (zest, gratitude, hope, love)were more strongly associated with ratings of life satisfaction than the strengths relat-ing to intellectual traits (curiosity, love of learning).
Are there exercises to improve happiness?
In a 2005 paper, Seligman, along with Tracy Steen, Nansook Park, and ChristopherPeterson, reported results from an extremely simple and cost-effective intervention to
281THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE: MOTIVATION AND THE SEARCH FOR HAPPINESSHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 281increase happiness. They conducted their study through an Internet Website. Visitors
to the Website were invited to participate in exercises designed to increase their happi-ness, with a warning that some visitors would be assigned to a placebo condition.Placebo conditions are routinely used as a comparison against the active treatmentcondition. Study participants were assigned to perform one of the following exercisesfor one week only. In the placebo condition, subjects had to write about early memo-ries each night.
There were five treatment conditions: the gratitude visit (within one week partici-
pants had to write and deliver a letter of gratitude to someone who had never beenproperly thanked for their kindness); three good things in life (each day participantshad to record three good things that happened and consider what caused them); youat your best (subjects were asked to write about a time when they were at their best,identify their signature strengths at that time, and then reflect upon what they wroteevery day for a week); using signature strengths in a new way (participants were askedto identify their top five character strengths and to put them to use in a novel wayeach day for a week); and identifying signature strengths (participants had to identifytheir top five signature strengths and to use them more often in the following week).
All of the conditions, including the placebo condition, improved happiness scores
and reduced depression scores immediately after the exercises were completed. Oneweek after that, scores for the placebo condition returned to baseline and stayed therefor the next six months. The effect of “you at your best” and “identifying signaturestrengths” also disappeared within one week after the exercises ended. The effect of “thegratitude visit” lasted somewhat longer, persisting for a month. Remarkably, the effectsof “the three good things” and “using signature strengths” interventions lasted for theentire six months of the study period. It appears that people who maintained improve-ment had continued performing their exercises throughout the six-month study period.
What is positive psychotherapy?
In a 2006 publication, Seligman, Taayab Rashid, and Acacia Parks reported theirresults from their more formal study of positive psychotherapy (PPT). Here theyadapted the exercises used in their Web-based study to more intensive forms of psy-chotherapy. The first study included forty mildly-to-moderately depressed undergrad-uate students. Nineteen students were assigned to two hours per week of group thera-py for six weeks, while twenty-one were assigned to a no-treatment control group.Treatment involved a package of six exercises similar to the ones assigned in the earli-er Web-based study. The last session focused on how to maintain therapeutic gainsand continue the exercises after the study ended.
Statistical analysis showed that the students in the PPT group had lower depression
scores and higher life satisfaction scores than the controls and that the improvementlasted for at least one year after the treatment ended. In a second study, more severely
282Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 282depressed patients were treated in individual therapy and compared to equally depressed
patients in usual treatment (psychotherapy with or without medication). The individualtherapy utilized many of the same techniques as the earlier two studies, but adapted theinterventions to address the greater severity of depression. After a maximum of twelveweeks, patients in PPT showed more improvement than patients in treatment as usual,with greater reductions in depression and higher increases in positive emotion.
HAPPINESS ACROSS CULTURES
How do we compare happiness across cultures?
There is a growing body of literature that looks at happiness from an internationalpoint of view. Studying happiness across different countries can be very helpful forpublic policy planners, allowing them to identify the social and political factors thatpromote well-being. As with other happiness research, the best way to measure thesubjective sense of happiness is to ask someone directly, “How happy are you?” Happi-ness researchers also ask people about their satisfaction with their life.
What problems are there with international happiness studies?
There are two main problems with this kind of research. The first involves potentialcultural differences in the understanding of what happiness means. The second has todo with the selection of study subjects. The sample from each country should be rep-resentative of the entire population. For example, if the sample is too heavily weightedtoward educated, urban dwellers—who are much more likely to take surveys thanuneducated rural villagers—then the happiness ratings may not accurately depict thatcountry’s population. Cross-cultural happiness researchers are aware of these prob-lems, however, and try to account for them in their study design.
What is the World Database of Happiness?
Ruut Veenhoven is a Dutch sociologist who has conducted cross-cultural researchinto happiness since the 1980s. In his World Database of Happiness, he has compileddata on happiness studies from countries all over the world into a publicly availableWebsite (www.worlddatabaseofhappiness.eur.nl). There is also data on the correlates ofhappiness. For example, how much do political freedom and gender equality correlatewith happiness? Veenhoven derives much of his findings from a ten-point scale rang-ing from 0 = most dissatisfied to ten = most satisfied.
What factors seem to contribute to happiness across nations?
On the whole, wealthier countries have happier citizens. Nonetheless, a country’swealth and its happiness ratings are not entirely aligned. Therefore money only
283THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE: MOTIVATION AND THE SEARCH FOR HAPPINESSHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 283accounts for part of the story. According to Veenhoven’s studies, war, political instabil-
ity, totalitarian governments, and economic chaos pull happiness ratings down. It alsoseems that democracy, security, gender equality, strong social programs, political sta-bility, and greater political and economic freedom promote happiness in a country’scitizens. Social cohesion, which Veenhoven refers to as “brotherhood,” is also animportant contributor to happiness.
How do the wealthiest countries do in terms of happiness?
Of the top ten wealthiest countries in terms of per capita income, only four (Iceland,Switzerland, Norway, and Luxembourg) ranked among the top ten happiest countries.The other six countries ranged from the fourteenth happiest country (Ireland) to thefifty-fifth (Hong Kong). Singapore ranked thirty-second in happiness ratings.
The United States is the fourth wealthiest country in terms of per capita income
with an average income of $47,000 per year, yet we ranked twenty-seventh in happi-ness ratings, with an average happiness rating of 7.0.
How does inequality in happiness come into play?
Veenhoven is also interested in the inequality of happiness ratings within countries. Inother words, how similar are the happiness ratings of various individuals within anygiven country? He constructed a measure called Inequality-Adjusted Happiness, whichwas based on the standard deviation of happiness ratings. The standard deviation is astatistical measure that reflects how much individual cases vary from the average.According to his calculations, the top five countries with both the highest and mostequal happiness ratings were Malta, Denmark, Switzerland, Iceland, and the Nether-lands. The middle five were the United States, the Philippines, Iran, South Korea, andIndia. The bottom five were Armenia, Ukraine, Moldova, Zimbabwe, and Tanzania.
Has average happiness changed over time?
According to Veenhoven’s work, there have been increases in average levels of report-ed happiness over time. In wealthy countries, these changes have been slight, but inless developed countries, the changes have been pronounced. In the United States,however, there has been essentially no change in the reported levels of happinessover the past sixty years. These findings have been used by Richard Easterlin to sup-port a theory that living conditions, which have risen steadily in the United Statesover the past sixty years, do not affect happiness. If we consider the findings on bothdeveloped and less-developed countries, we can see that happiness is most stronglyrelated to living conditions when money is scarce and living conditions are less thanoptimal. After people reach a reasonable standard of living, however, affluence doesnot add much to happiness.
284Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 284Are people in wealthier countries happier than those in poorer nations?
The list of happiness ratings below was collected from the World Database of Happi-
ness, which compiles data on happiness studies from all over the world. These ratingsapply to the years 2000 to 2008. The information on each country’s income was gath-ered from the CIA World Fact Book. Per capita income refers to the average income ofeach country’s citizens. As we can see from the table, the average happiness ratings,which range from 0 (least happy) to 10 (most happy), vary across the four incomequartiles. On average, wealthy countries have higher happiness ratings.

THE PSYCHOLOGY OF MONEY
What is the theory of rational economic man?
Ever since the 1700s when the seeds of modern economic theory first developed,
economists have assumed that people have a very simple relationship with money. Therational economic man is seen to act more or less like a calculating machine. Finan-
cial decisions regarding how we spend, borrow, and save, are based on a rationalassessment of our losses and gains. We compare the value of what we pay out to thevalue of what we take in and make decisions accordingly. If we make mistakes in thesecalculations, we eventually recognize them and correct our behavior.
What is wrong with the theory of rational economic man?
The problem with this theory is that it is often wrong. As the great financial crisis of2008 has shown us, people’s economic behavior is often anything but rational. Leadingup to this crisis, the whole country gorged on unaffordable debt. In 2007, according tothe U.S. Federal Reserve, the median savings rate for American households was justabove zero and the median income for a large section of the population had remainedflat for several years. Nonetheless, our household debt continued to grow, 11 percentbetween 2004 and 2007, and 34 percent in the three years preceding that. In fact, from2004 to 2007, the median credit card balance rose 25 percent. In other words, we werespending more than we could afford. This was not due to the cost of living, as inflationhad remained quite low. We were on a giant national binge. While psychology cannotaccount for the full complexity of economic events—larger political, legislative, envi-ronmental, and cultural factors play a central role—more and more economists arerecognizing the critical importance of people’s emotional responses to money.
What is behavioral economics?
Behavioral economics is a multi-disciplinary field, linking economics, psychology, andneuroscience. It developed as a reaction against the prevailing view of rational eco-
287THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE: MOTIVATION AND THE SEARCH FOR HAPPINESSHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 287nomic man. The focus of behavioral economics is the actual psychology of human
financial decision making. How do people make decisions about money? What aretheir blind spots? Where does emotion come in? The first decade of the twenty-firstcentury has brought an explosion of research in this area of study. Some of the scien-tists involved include Daniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky, Daniel Ariely, Read Montague,and Richard Thaler. There have also been a number of books written by science jour-nalists, such as Jonah Lehrer and Jason Zweig.
What role does evaluation of risk and reward have in
financial behavior?
Every financial decision involves risk and reward. The risk is the loss of money, forexample, through a bad investment or through spending too much on something oflittle value. The reward is the possibility of making more money or the purchase ofsomething we value.
288How much debt are Americans carrying?
The table below is based on data taken from the Federal Reserve and showsthe nature and amount of Americans’ debt in 2007. The third column
shows the percentage of American families (perhaps more accurately referredto as households) that hold each kind of debt. The fourth column shows themedian amount of debt of the households that hold debt. Remember themedian refers to the amount that equally divides the top and bottom half ofthe population.

evaluation of risk and reward ?
In order to survive, an animal needs to be
highly attuned to both risk and reward.Examples of reward include food, sex, andsocial status; examples of risk include dan-ger from predators, within-species aggres-sion, and loss of resources. Our emotionallife evolved as a means for us to quickly andefficiently recognize and respond to cues inthe environment that are relevant to oursurvival. Our core emotions—such asdesire, happiness, sadness, fear, and anger—help us process information about riskand reward. Because emotions and the partsof the brain that mediate them are relativelyold on an evolutionary scale, we share manyof our core emotions with other mammals,such as primates, cats, and dogs.
How important are our emotions in our decisions about money?
Although we may think we make financial decisions through thoughtful analysis, intruth it is our emotions that do the lion’s share of the work. Brain imaging studiesshow that the emotional parts of our brain are extremely active when we make deci-sions about money. In fact, the emotional brain is frequently more active than the partsof our brain involved with thought. Therefore, in order to understand the psychology ofmoney, we have to understand how emotion affects our decisions about money.
What role do fear and desire play in the psychology of money?
These are the primary emotions involved in financial decisions. Our fear motivates usto avoid loss, in this case the loss of money. Desire motivates us to pursue reward,such as money or the goods that money can buy. When desire for money becomesexcessive and poorly controlled, we call it greed.
What problems do our emotions cause us when making financial decisions?
Even though our emotions have evolved over millions of years to help us adapt to ourenvironment, they are not perfect tools and can often lead us astray. For one thing,our emotions are geared almost entirely toward the present. Our emotions can tell usa lot about our needs in the present, but they are not good at telling us what we will

For that, we need thought and careful analysis. Secondly, our emo-
tions are stimulus bound, in other words they are highly and sometimes excessivelyresponsive to cues in the environment.
How are we biased toward immediate consequences over
long-term consequences?
There is clear evidence that the short term generally has far greater influence on ourdecision making than concerns about the long term. In fact, it takes considerablemental effort to put long-term consequences ahead of immediate gratification. Ouruse of credit cards provides a perfect example. A 2001 experiment by Drazen Prelecand Duncan Simester shows how the use of credit cards increases our spending, pre-sumably because the money spent seems less immediate. The researchers set up anauction for basketball tickets, in which half the participants in the auction wereinstructed to pay with credit cards and the other half with cash. As expected, the bidsmade from credit cards were much higher, in fact twice as high, as those made withcash. In another study, Laurence Ausubel looked at consumer response to two com-mercial mortgages. The first mortgage offered a low teaser rate (4.9 percent for sixmonths) that was followed by a lifetime rate of 16 percent. The second mortgageoffered a higher teaser rate (6.9 percent) but a lower lifetime rate of 14 percent.Ausubel found that consumers chose the first mortgage almost three times moreoften than the second mortgage. Hence, they chose the mortgage that would savethem money in the short run but cost far more money in the long run.
What does it mean to be stimulus bound ?
Not only are we primed to put immediate considerations over long-term ones, we areprimed to respond to cues in our environment that signal immediate risk or reward.
These cues can then influence our appraisal of risk and reward–and sometimes throwus entirely off course. For example, when are people most motivated to stick to a diet:when they are in the store trying on bathing suits or when they are walking past an icecream parlor?
What is the anchoring effect?
The anchoring effect refers to the way an irrelevant stimulus can have a strong effecton further decisions. For example, Dan Ariely and colleagues held an auction for arange of items. Before people were allowed to bid in the auction, they were asked towrite down the last two digits of their social security number. Although the socialsecurity number had no logical relationship to the auction, people who wrote downhigher numbers bid an average of three times more money for the same items thanpeople who wrote down low numbers.
290Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 290What is the framing effect?
In the framing effect, the way that information is presented influences our response to
it. In other words, whether the risk or the reward is highlighted drastically affects ourown appraisal of risk and reward. In a 2006 study, Benedetto de Martino and his col-leagues ran an experiment in which people were handed fifty dollars and then giventwo choices. Their first option was to keep twenty dollars. They were then offered agamble with a chance of keeping or losing the whole fifty dollars. In this scenario,only 42 percent chose the gamble. When the same choices were framed in terms ofloss instead of gain (subjects would lose thirty dollars rather than keep twenty dol-
lars), 62 percent of the subjects took the gamble. Decisions were strongly influencedby the way that risks and rewards were framed. As we can imagine, advertisers are wellaware of this tendency and put it to good use.
How well do we evaluate the probability of risk and reward ?
Our emotions are not very good at considering probability. We are highly attuned tothe intensity of a risk or reward and get emotionally aroused by high value rewards or
risks, but we do a poor job of balancing the intensity of a consequence with its proba-bility. For example, many people are more afraid of a terrorist attack than of hyperten-sion, although far more people in the developed Western world will die from heart dis-ease than from a terrorist attack.
What is loss aversion?
This concept, introduced by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Twersky as far back as the1970s, refers to our emotional reaction to cues of immediate loss. Emotionally, we areprimed to hold onto what we have and to strenuously try to avoid loss. Consequently,we tend to avoid a choice that will lose us money in the short run, even if it will makeus more money in the long run. It is important to remember that this tendency isstimulus bound. So we are not responding to the actual possibility of loss as much as
the cuethat signals the possibility of loss. In the absence of such loss cues, we can be
sideswiped by reward cues, as happens when we overspend on our credit cards.Because of this, manipulation of cues will strongly influence our behavior.
The deMartino experiment on the framing effect described above supports our
tendency toward loss aversion. Another experiment reported by Jonah Lehrer in hisbook on decision making shows the effect of loss aversion. A group of physicians wasgiven a scenario involving an outbreak of a lethal disease. In the first condition, twooptions were described in terms of the number of people that would live. In option 1,
200 (of a group of 600) people would survive. In option 2, there was a one-thirdchance that 600 people would be saved and a two-thirds chance that no one would besaved. Only 28 percent of the physicians chose the second, riskier strategy. When thesame options were described in terms of the number of people that would die, 78 per-
291THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE: MOTIVATION AND THE SEARCH FOR HAPPINESSHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 291cent of the physicians chose the risky strategy. Here we see how emotional biases
affect the decisions even of highly trained people in responsible positions.
Why does “buy low, sell high” go against human nature?
This is the basic wisdom of the stock market: buy a stock when it is undervalued andsell it when it gains in value. This way you maximize your profit on the sale of thestock. Leaving aside the difficulty of predicting whether a stock is going to increase ordecrease in value, this action goes against our basic emotional nature. As detailed inthe section on behaviorism, we are primed to repeat behaviors that are rewarded anddiscontinue behaviors that are punished. When a stock is going up, our purchase isrewarded, so we are likely to want to buy. When a stock is going down, we are pun-ished for our purchase, so we are less inclined to buy.
So does cognition play any role in financial decisions?
Of course we do use thought when making financial decisions. There is more to ourpsychology than just our emotions. We use cognition when we plan for the future,analyze complex situations, and calculate numerical amounts (after all, money isbased on numbers). However, there are important limits to our analytic capacities andthese limitations play out in our financial decisions.
What are the limits of our own analytic ability?
Despite the remarkable intellectual abilities humans do enjoy, there are clear limits toour ability to analyze economic information. For one, the frontal lobe, the area of thebrain that mediates complex thought, has a limited amount of processing capability.The complex cognitive capacities that the frontal lobe provides take up a good deal ofenergy and calories, and incorporate a large amount of neurocircuitry. In other words,intellectual analysis of financial information is very “expensive.” Consequently, ourbrain is highly dependent on energy-efficient shortcuts that allow us to process a lot ofinformation very quickly. While these shortcuts allow us to function in the real world,they can also lead us astray. Three cognitive shortcuts that influence our thinkingabout money include: chunking, sensitivity to context, and the zero-sum gamebetween our emotions and cognition.
How does chunking influence our decision making?
As was first pointed out by George Miller in 1956, we are capable of keeping only sevenplus or minus two pieces of information in mind at a time. In order to expand thecapacity of our memory, we group information into larger chunks. This is useful untilwe forget that the larger chunks were originally made up of smaller units. For exam-ple, as documented in a 2006 study by Andrew Geier, Paul Rozin, and Gheorghe Doros,
292Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 292people will eat more pieces of candy when using a large scoop than when using a
smaller scoop. Further, as noted in Jonathon Lehrer’s 2009 book on decision making,it is also well recognized that people will eat more food when their portion sizes orplates are larger. Instead of counting how many pieces of candy or ounces of food theyare consuming, people count number of scoops or plates of food. When fast foodrestaurants offer jumbo-size servings they are taking advantage of this tendency.
How does our sensitivity to context affect our decision making?
People are not very good at evaluating the absolute value of an item. We tend to seevalue as relative. In other words, our estimation of the value of an object will varytremendously depending on the situation. The economist Richard Thaler asked peopleif they would go twenty minutes out of their way to save five dollars on either a $15calculator or a $125 leather jacket. Sixty-eight percent of people said yes for the calcu-lator, but only 29 percent said yes for the leather jacket. Even though the amount ofmoney was exactly the same, the five dollars seemed like it was worth more in the first
condition, as it was a larger amount relative to the cost of the calculator. In the secondcondition, the five dollars seemed like it was worth less because it was smaller relativeto the cost of the leather jacket.
How does too much information damage our impulse control?
There is somewhat of a zero-sum game between our intellect and our emotions. Thebrain depends on energy, just like a car depends on gas. If too much fuel is going toour pre-frontal cortex to support cognition, less fuel is available to the parts of thefrontal lobe that inhibit our emotional impulses. This was shown in a 1999 experi-ment by Baba Shiv and Alexander Fedorikhin. Subjects were given two different mem-ory tasks, an easy task (to remember two digits) and a difficult task (to rememberseven digits). Remember we can only hold about seven digits in mind at a time. Sub-jects were then offered their choice of either chocolate cake or a healthy fruit salad.People with the easy task were more likely to take the healthy food while people withthe difficult task were more likely to take the chocolate cake. The authors interpretedthis to mean that energy expended to perform the harder memory task depleted thebrain’s ability to resist temptation.
What about the social context?
Our evaluation of worth and value is also powerfully influenced by social factors. Con-sider the amount of money people are willing to spend for high-status belongings. Is apurse really worth $1,000? Is a watch? How many people would pay $80,000 for aBMW if the logo was removed and nobody could tell it was a BMW? People pay outra-geous prices for luxury brands not because they believe the products themselves areworth the money, but because the product takes on social meaning. In effect, people
293THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE: MOTIVATION AND THE SEARCH FOR HAPPINESSHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 293are buying social status. This is why high-
status people, such as movie stars or starathletes, are paid millions to endorseproducts such as athletic wear, cereal, ormattresses. Likewise, our sense of a fairsalary, a reasonable price, and the worthof a purchase is often judged according tothe social context. How much are ourcolleagues getting paid? How much didour neighbors pay for their car? Onceagain, advertisers are well aware of thistendency and have learned how to posi-tion their products to benefit from thesocial context.
THE BIOLOGY
OF MONEY
What is neuroeconomics ?
Neuroeconomics involves the study of theregions of the brain that are involved inour responses to money. As we learnmore about the psychological processesunderlying our financial decisions, we arebetter able to investigate which parts of
the brain are active when we make financial decisions. We can now ask: What parts ofthe brain turn on when we see something we want to buy? How about when we see theprice tag, or when we take a financial gamble? What about when we lose money?
How do scientists study neuroeconomics?
There are now many ways to look inside the brain. Older brain-imaging technologieslike MRI, PET, and SPECT allowed us to take a snapshot of the brain. By recordingblood flow or glucose uptake, we could map a pattern of brain activity at a given pointin time. However, the development of fMRI brain-imaging technology has completelychanged the game. Now, by recording the behavior of magnetized atoms, we canwatch brain activity over time. We have moved from still shots to movies. This is criti-
cally important if we want to investigate brain activity during a sequence of mental
processes. With fMRI technology, we can put people in scanners and watch how theirbrains respond while we run an experiment.

Advertisers have long understood the importance of the
emotional brain in making purchasing decisions, even beforefMRI research. For example, a company selling lipstick associatesthe product with a life of beauty, youth, and glamour, eventhough it’s unrealistic to believe lipstick will provide all thesethings (iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 294What parts of the brain are involved with financial decisions?
There are several areas of the brain that have been implicated in the mental processes
involved with financial decisions. These divide fairly neatly into areas associated withcognitive or emotional processes. The prefrontal cortex is involved with careful analy-
sis, quantitative reasoning, and consideration of future consequences; it is the seat ofplanning for the future. Several smaller areas deep within the middle of the brainmediate the emotional aspects of our financial life. The nucleus accumbens , a central
point in the dopaminergic reward circuitry, is involved with desire and motivation topursue reward. The amygdala is particularly sensitive to fearful stimuli. The insula,
which is actually part of the cortex but is sandwiched inside the frontal, parietal andtemporal lobes, is responsive to feelings of pain and disgust. The insula is activatedwhen we lose money.
What function does the prefrontal cortex serve?
The prefrontal cortex is the most anterior (or frontal) part of the frontal lobe. Thefrontal lobe makes up the front half of the cerebral cortex, which is the wrinkled outercovering of the brain. The pre-frontal cortex integrates information from the rest ofthe brain, creating an overview of our current situation. Not only does the prefrontalcortex create a representation of our self in our environment, but it can create repre-
295THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE: MOTIVATION AND THE SEARCH FOR HAPPINESS
This is a photograph of an MRI brain scan. Arrows point to areas of the brain that are close to those regions involved with our
response to money. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is involved in our analysis of long-term consequences of financial decisions. Th e
amygdala is particularly responsive to fearful cues, and the nucleus accumbens is a key player in the reward system, mobilizing us topursue rewarding stimuli ( iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 295296sentations of future conditions. In this way, the prefrontal cortex supports our ability
to plan, set future goals, and correct our behavior in pursuit of these goals. The pre-frontal cortex is also involved with the precise, careful analysis of information, such asthe calculation of cost over time.
Because the prefrontal cortex can create and hold representations of possible
events and not just current events, our prefrontal cortex allows us to be more flexiblein our thinking and even to come up with creative new solutions to problems. This isin contrast with the evolutionarily older parts of the brain involved with emotion.These areas are more stimulus dependent, more bound to cues in the present. Thefrontal lobe is also involved in inhibiting our emotional reactions; it inhibits the lim-bic system and other parts of the brain that mediate drive and motivation. In otherwords, the frontal cortex allows us to regulate emotion and impulse with thought.
What are the drawbacks with the prefrontal cortex?
As mentioned above, the frontal cortex takes up an enormous amount of energy, andmobilizes a large portion of the brain. Although the prefrontal cortex is powerful, it isslow and inefficient. Thus we would miss a good deal of information if we were solelydependent on our frontal lobe for reading our environment. Additionally, the pre-frontal cortex does not address personal value.
It is our emotions that tell us the value of any given situation, whether and how
something matters to us. In fact, without a sense of something’s personal value, weare unable to make decisions. For example, people with lesions in their orbital frontalcortex cannot make decisions. This is a region that integrates information about ouremotions into our reading of current and future events. Furthermore, if we thinkabout a decision too much, it distorts our decisions.
In a 1993 study by Timothy Wilson and colleagues, undergraduate women were
given the option to pick one of five posters. The subjects were divided into two groups.In one group, the subjects were instructed to rate from 1 to 9 how much they likedeach poster prior to picking one. In the second group, subjects filled out a question-naire about why they liked or disliked each poster before making their choice. Severalweeks later, 75 percent of the second group regretted their decision, while none of thefirst group did. In this case, over-analysis interfered with effective decision making.
How much is the prefrontal cortex involved in purchasing decisions?
Because purchasing decisions are primarily about personal value, about how much wegain or lose, the prefrontal cortex does not seem to be the dominant player in ourbrain’s response to purchasing decisions. According to a 2007 fMRI experiment byBrian Knutson, George Lowestein, and colleagues, the frontal cortex was less activatedduring purchasing decisions than either the nucleus accumbens (which processesHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 296What did a 2007 experiment with wine
show about the way people make decisions?
In a 2007 experiment by Hilke
Plassman and colleagues, sub-
jects were invited to participate in awine tasting while sitting in anfMRI scanner. Three bottles of winewere poured into five different bot-tles, giving the impression that allfive bottles contained differentwines. The bottles’ original labelswere removed and replaced withnew price tags. Even though somebottles with different prices actual-ly contained the same wine, sub-jects clearly preferred the mostexpensive wine. Moreover, the pre-frontal cortex was the area of thebrain that most strongly respondedto the price tag. This suggests thatour prefrontal cortex is involved inevaluating our experiences according to what we think should be important,
regardless of what we actually feel. In this way, if we rely too much on our intel-lect when making decisions, we might focus on the wrong features. A balancebetween thought and emotion is necessary for effective decisionmaking.
Do we judge wine based on the price tag? One study says we
do, believing that a costlier wine must be better than acheaper wine, even if the same wine is put in both bottles(iStock).THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE: MOTIVATION AND THE SEARCH FOR HAPPINESS
297rewards), or the insula (which processes pain). This suggests that purchasing deci-
sions are driven more by the balance of pain and desire than by a rational assessmentof our options.
What function does the dopaminergic reward system serve?
The dopaminergic reward system is a circuit that runs through the middle of the
brain. In the last decade or so it has received considerable attention because of its cen-tral role in a wide range of psychological phenomena. The dopaminergic reward cir-cuitry starts in the ventral tegmentum, an area in the midbrain. This is where we findthe cell bodies for the neurons that contain the neurotransmitter dopamine. This par-
ticular dopamine tract is called the mesolimbic dopaminergic tract, meaning it runsthrough the limbic system in the middle of the brain.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 297The dopaminergic neurons eventually connect to the nucleus accumbens, which
is a critical node in the reward circuitry. The reward circuitry responds to reward cues
and serves to mobilize the organism to pursue reward. Subjectively, we experiencethis kind of mobilization as desire, excitement, or craving. The reward system is cen-trally involved in our financial life. Whenever we experience desire for money or forthe goods that money can buy, our reward system is activated.
How strongly does the reward system affect motivation?
It must be kept in mind that the reward system has a very powerful effect on motivation.When it is really firing, our desire can be overwhelming. In the most extreme state, weexperience addictive craving, which can overpower any consideration of danger orfuture consequences. So, when we are caught up in the thrill of making money, ourreward system can overpower the inhibiting (and cautionary) effect of the frontal lobe.
How does the dopamine system set expectations?
The dopaminergic reward system not only responds to the presence of rewards, itlearns which cues signal reward and which do not. Therefore the reward circuitry iscentrally involved with setting expectations. It is in the business of distinguishing
which cues do and do not signal reward and in priming us to pursue a reward when itdetects a relevant cue.
What are the drawbacks of the dopamine system?
The reward system has evolved over millions of years to help us recognize the pres-ence of rewards and to motivate us to expend considerable energy to pursue andobtain them. However, it is not foolproof. For one, it responds to the intensity of areward but not the probability. Secondly, it is over-responsive to novelty, or intermit-tent reinforcement. Thirdly, it does not do well with randomness.
What are the effects of the lack of sensitivity to probability?
The dopaminergic reward system is clearly reactive to the intensity of a reward. Forexample in an fMRI study by Brian Knutson, the nucleus accumbens was twice as acti-vated in response to a promised reward of five dollars as to a reward of one dollar.However, this system does not process the probability of a reward, how likely it is forthis reward to actually occur. This lack of discrimination between low-probability andhigh-probability rewards can explain our attraction to lottery tickets. Why does thepurchase of lottery tickets skyrocket when the prize money hits the millions? Because,even though the intensity of the reward stimulates our dopaminergic reward system,the low probability of winning does not register. To the extent that our frontal lobedoes process probability information, our reward system may overpower it.
298Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 298How is the reward system reactive to intermittent reinforcement?
Our dopaminergic reward system is particularly sensitive to intermittent reinforce-
ment. When a behavior is intermittently reinforced, the reward for a given behavior isirregular and unpredictable. Dopamine neurons are particularly sensitive to noveltyand surprise, so when behavior is unpredictably reinforced, each experience of rewardcomes as a surprise. In fact an unpredicted reward is perhaps three to four times asactivating as a predictable reward. This pattern contributes to our vulnerability togambling, which is defined by intermittent reinforcement.
How does the reward system make us susceptible to gambling?
There is evidence that gambling activates the dopaminergic reward system and thatpeople suffering from pathological gambling have abnormalities in this system. JonahLehrer relates one particularly telling example involving a woman who developedParkinson’s disease. Parkinson’s disease is caused by cell death of the dopamine neu-rons in the basal ganglia. The treatment usually involves medication that increasesthe amount of dopamine in the brain. When this woman was treated with a dopamineagonist (a medication that increases dopamine activity), her Parkinson’s drasticallyimproved. Unfortunately, she also suddenly developed a serious gambling condition,which ultimately robbed her of her money, her house, and her marriage. When themedication was discontinued, her gambling problem disappeared.
How does the dopaminergic reward system respond to randomness?
Additionally, the dopaminergic reward system does not do well with randomness. Thissystem has evolved to detect patterns and still tends to interpret patterns even whenno pattern is really there. Consequently, we tend to overestimate our ability to predictfuture events from past events. We can see this when we consider how people demon-strate frequent overconfidence when picking stocks. If there is a good run in the stockmarket or in the real estate market, people tend to assume this run will continue for-ever. In truth, a streak of good luck can end at any time. When we assume that pastfortune guarantees future fortune, we make foolish investments. Hence, we becomeoverconfident at our ability to predict future events. This mechanism is a central con-tributor to financial bubbles.
What role does the amygdala play?
Amygdala is a critical part of the limbic system. The amygdala is particularly respon-sive to fearful cues, that is, cues of danger. When amygdala is activated, it stimulatesactivity in the hypothalamus, which in turn sends messages to the autonomic nervoussystem. This activates physiological stress responses, such as rapid heart beat, perspi-ration, shallow breath, etc. The amygdala is highly responsive to cues of financial loss.
299THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE: MOTIVATION AND THE SEARCH FOR HAPPINESSHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 299Cues signaling immediate danger of loss activate the amygdala. This in turn stimu-
lates an emotional reaction which may or may not reach consciousness, but willnonetheless affect our decision making. This reaction underlies our tendency to lossaversion. Like the nucleus accumbens and the dopaminergic reward system, theamygdala is highly attuned to immediate cues, but not very good at evaluating themeaning of the cues in the context of current and future circumstances. That role fallsto the frontal lobe.
What is the role of the insula?
The insula is an area of the cortex that is sandwiched between the frontal, parietal, andtemporal lobes. It communicates information about our internal bodily states to ourcortex. In this way, it contributes to experiences of disgust and pain. The insula is acti-vated when we experience the pain of losing money. For example, activity in the insulaincreases when we look at the price tags of our purchases and it decreases when wepay with credit cards as opposed to cash.
What happens in our brains when we make socially conforming decisions?
As social animals we feel an extraordinary pull to act within socially condoned waysand we resist behaving in ways that go against the group. In a study conducted by Gre-gory Burns and reported by the journalist Jason Zweig, people made correct choices ina cognitive test 84 percent of the time when they made the decisions by themselves,but only 59 percent of the time when they were exposed to incorrect decisions madeby four peers. When the subjects conformed to the decisions of their peers, there wasdecreased activation in their prefrontal cortex, perhaps reflecting a reduction in inde-pendent thought. However, when they went against group norms, there was increasedactivation in the amygdala, suggesting a fear response.

Why are group dynamics important?
The study of group dynamics is important because groups are important. Our rela-
tionships with groups pervade almost every aspect of our lives. We are raised in fami-
lies and educated in schools. Most of us work in a group setting and many of us live infamilies of our own. Moreover, we all live in a community, belong to one or more eth-nic groups, and are categorized into a specific gender. Groups shape our daily life,powerfully influence our identity and self-esteem, and even shape our very perceptionof the world around us. Consequently, our psychology and the brain that creates ithave evolved to promote our participation in groups.
Is a group larger than the sum of its parts?
The basic assumption of group dynamics is that there are characteristics of the groupthat cannot be reduced to the behavior of individual group members. In other words,the group has a personality of its own. We can see how this works when we considerthat groups persist even after the individual members change. Individual group mem-bers may come and go, but the characteristics of the group continue. In effect, this iswhat is meant by culture; the norms and values and customs of the group—be it aninstitution, a society, an ethnic group, a religious group, or a corporation—exist apartfrom the individual members. This is not to say that groups do not change or thatindividual members do not matter, but that groups can develop an enduring identityand character that is independent of individual members.

GROUP 
DYNAMICS AND THE PUBLIC SPHEREHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 301How do we define a group?
There are various ways to define groups. Groups can be defined as a collection of peo-
ple who share a common fate, who share a social structure, or who engage in face-to-face-interaction. In his 2000 book, Rupert Brown suggests the following definition: agroup consists of two or more people who identify themselves as members of thegroup. Additionally, the group’s existence must be recognized by at least one otherperson who is not a group member.
What role does social psychology play in the study of
group dynamics ?
Following the almost unimaginable slaughter of WWII, scholars in many fieldsbecame preoccupied by the notion of conformity. How could so many otherwise ordi-nary people participate in the atrocities of the Holocaust? Can the pressure to conformbe so powerful that it can account for such extreme behavior? Questions such as thesespurred investigation into the behavior of groups. A good deal of research on thestructure and behavior of groups has been performed within a branch of psychologyknown as social psychology. Social psychologists conducted research on groupnorms, group identity, and on conformity. One of the pioneers of group dynamics wasa social psychologist named Kurt Lewin (1890–1947).
Did psychoanalysis have any influence on the study of
group dynamics ?
While social psychologists were interested in the uniformity of groups—that is, theway that group members act in concert—some psychoanalysts became interestedin the interactions among group members. From working in clinical settings,
these clinicians recognized that group dynamics influenced the ways people relateto each other. Specifically, they noticed the ways that group members formedalliances with each other, split into different factions, and aligned with, and thenrebelled against, group leaders. Wilfred Bion (1897–1979) was a pioneer in thismovement. Another influential clinician in the group therapy movement is the psy-chiatrist Irvin Yalom (1931–).
What is group identity?
Group identity refers to the recognition of the group as a distinct unit by both mem-
bers and nonmembers. Group identity is a critical part of a group’s well-being andmuch of the behavior of a group will serve to promote and maintain group identity.For example, specific rituals, forms of dress, and speech patterns can help distinguishgroup members from nonmembers and thus promote group identity. We see this withteenage cliques, religious groups, and even military regiments.
302Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 302How does group identity affect personal identity?
Individual group members reshape their own individual identity in keeping with their
group membership. Our social identity is a function of our group memberships. By
identifying with certain groups, we state that we share values, goals, and beliefs withthat group. Moreover, our self-esteem is impacted by our status and value within thegroup as well as the group’s status in relation to other groups. People who belong tolow status or devalued groups suffer damage to their self-esteem. Likewise, people cangain self-esteem by joining a group that values them and/or is valued by others.
What are group norms?
Group norms refer to the rules and expectations governing the behavior of members of
the group. For example, within a corporate setting, individual group members areexpected to dress and act professionally. They should not wear overly casual clothes,engage in illegal behavior, drink alcohol, or behave in explicitly sexual or violent ways.They are expected to display a strong work ethic. In contrast, in adolescent street gangs,group members are expected to show unquestionable loyalty, present themselves astough and ready for violence, and show little deference to conventional authority.
What happens when group members violate group norms?
When individual group members violate group norms, the group will act to bringtheir behavior back into compliance. Consider what would happen to a corporate

her colleagues, and then destroys office furniture. The group (in this case the corpora-tion) would act immediately to bring the employee back in line. Either that, or theemployee would be expelled.
What is group cohesion ?
Group cohesion refers to the degree that group members feel identified with and com-
mitted to the group. It is a reflection of the closeness and connection of the group as awhole. Cohesive groups have a strong group identity and tightly adhere to groupnorms. Early social psychologists believed that group cohesion reflected the degree towhich individual members like each other. However, later researchers suggested thatcohesion reflected the attachment of group members to the idea of the group rather
than their attachment to specific group members. How much do group membersagree with the goals and values of the group? How strongly do they feel about them?
What factors enhance group cohesion ?
A variety of factors promote group cohesion. These include shared goals that haveemotional significance to group members, as well as a history of success in reachingthose goals. Leadership styles are also important. Effective leaders attend both to thegoals of the group and to the social and emotional needs of the group. Finally, opposi-tion to or contrast with an out-group can also promote group cohesion. In some cases,this can be harmless or even beneficial, as with rivalry between sports teams. However,this tendency can also have negative implications as groups can demonize out-groupsor escalate inter-group tensions in an effort to promote group cohesion. This can takethe form of racism, prejudice, or even wars.
What function do initiation rituals serve?
Initiation rites are found in diverse groups across many different cultures. Beforebeing accepted to the group, an initiate must undergo various trials, most involvingsome degree of discomfort, pain, and humiliation. Such rites serve to increase initi-ates’ loyalty and obedience to the group and to heighten the boundary between the in-group and the out-group. Social psychologists have theorized about the mechanismbehind initiation rites. Some have suggested that cognitive dissonance plays a role.
This theory, first presented by Leon Festinger in 1957, states that people tend to ratio-nalize away contradictory thoughts. Therefore, an initiate might reason “if I wentthough all this trouble to join this group, I must really want to get in.”
Are there examples of modern initiation rites?
Anthropologists have long spoken about initiation rites in pre-modern societies. Forexample, adolescent boys in the Fulani tribe in West Africa engage in whipping battles

lescent males are found across different tribes in New Guinea. Many rites in modernWestern culture may not be recognized as initiation rites per se although they maywell serve that function. For example, boot camp in the marines, hazing in fraterni-ties, and thirty-six-hour work shifts for medical residents may function as initiationrites. Initiates must go through painful and often humiliating trials before beingaccepted into an exclusive group.
How does group conformity shape individual opinions?
Although we may think we come to our opinions independently, research shows thatpeople are profoundly influenced by group norms at all levels of thought and behavior.People feel tremendous pressure to conform to group norms and feel anxiety whenthey go against the group. An fMRI study by Gregory Burns showed increased activa-tion in the amygdala when people made non-conforming decisions. The amygdala is abrain region associated with the fear response. Moreover, a large body of social psy-chology research illustrates how the pressure to conform can influence even our per-ceptions of physical reality. The presence of four peers stating a consistently wrongopinion can cause subjects to deny even obvious physical facts, for example, to call acolor green when it is clearly blue.
305GROUP DYNAMICS AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE
Hazing rituals in fraternities can be seen as an example of a modern initiation rite. Pledges, or new initiates, are expected t o undergo
various trials which can include drinking massive amounts of water or alcohol. Although hazing practices have led to lawsuits a nd
even deaths on occasion, the continuing popularity of this practice speaks to the psychological importance that initiation rite s can
have for group identity and cohesion ( iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 305When is conformity most pronounced?
Conformity is most pronounced in new or ambiguous situations when people are least
confident about their own opinions. When people are more knowledgeable or moresecure about their opinions, they are less swayed by group-think. People are also moreconformist when their group identity is new or tentative. This is particularly acute inadolescence, when the adolescent’s entire social identity is new and insecure. Considerthe intense pressure to conform that many adolescents feel regarding their choice ofclothing, music, interests, and even friends. Most adults would consider these deci-sions to be either minor or personal, certainly not a target of intense social pressure.
How do groups react to new ideas?
In general, groups are conservative and slow to change. They are homeostatic. Inother words, they work to regain their former state in the face of change. Consequent-
306What are some important experiments that have shown
people’s tendency to conform to group norms?
Two classic social psychology experiments illustrate the power of groupnorms. In a pioneering experiment by Muzafer Sherif in 1936, people were
exposed to an optical illusion called the autokinetic effect. If you shine a pin-prick of light in a completely dark room, the dot of light will appear to move.Sherif asked his subjects to estimate how much the light moved. He first testedpeople alone and then in groups of two or three. He found that when testedalone, individuals gave very different estimates of the light’s movement. Ingroups, however, people’s estimates tended to converge to the same answer. Agroup norm was formed that shaped people’s perception.
In 1956, Solomon Asch published results of another classic experiment.
Subjects were recruited to take part in an experiment of visual judgment. Theywere placed in small groups and shown pictures of several lines. The groupswere asked to match a target line with one of three comparison lines. In fact,only one member of the group was an actual subject. The others were part of theexperiment, with instructions to unanimously state the wrong answer two-thirds of the time. The real point of the study was to see whether the true studysubjects, the “naïve” subjects, would answer correctly when their group mem-bers gave the wrong answer or whether they would conform to the group normand agree to the wrong answer. In fact, the naïve participants did conform to thewrong answer (either fully or in part) 36 percent of the time. This study wasimportant because it showed that people will alter their response according togroup norms even when it is clear that the group is objectively wrong.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 306ly, group members tend to be far more responsive to majority opinions than to minor-
ity opinions. This has been shown many times in various adaptations of SolomonAsch’s classic 1956 conformity experiment.
When does a nonconformist develop influence?
Groups are not entirely closed to new ideas and there are opportunities for minorityinfluence. If the ideas of the majority are not strongly held and do not carry much per-sonal or emotional weight, the group will be less closed to new ideas and minorityopinions. Moreover, if the minority group is consistent in their positions, this hasmore impact than if they are not consistent. Further, majority influence seems to bemost powerful in the immediate aftermath of the discussion and in public settings. Asthere is social cost to deviance, people tend to conform publicly. However, over time,perhaps when the source of the new ideas has slipped from memory, the new ideas arelikely to show more influence. This may explain why totalitarian governments go to somuch trouble to stifle dissent. They realize that even unpopular opinions can haveconsiderable impact over time.
Are all group roles the same?
Although some uniformity of values, behaviors, and viewpoints is necessary withingroups, group members are not all interchangeable. In many groups, there is role dif-ferentiation. For example, in a work setting, every employee has a specific set of tasksand responsibilities. Group roles are also differentiated according to status and inmost groups there is some degree of a status hierarchy. In other words, some roleshave more power and prestige than others.
Who was Wilfred Bion?
Wilfred Bion (1897–1979) was one of the pioneers of group psychotherapy. A psycho-analyst in the tradition of Melanie Klein (1882–1960), his main point was that the psy-chology of groups paralleled that of individuals. Like many before him, he was struckby the primitive quality of many group processes, the regressed and emotionallyuncontrolled behavior that groups sometimes demonstrate. Using a very dense theoryof emotional life, which may look bizarre to the modern reader, he nonetheless pro-vided valuable insights about group dynamics.
Bion believed that the primitive quality of group psychology corresponded to the
most primitive aspects of individual psychology. An immature or more primitive mindthinks only in extremes and in opposites (good/bad, love/hate). A mature mind canunderstand complexity, can see that people are a mix of good and bad. The world existsin shades of gray; it is not just black and white. In the same way that individuals can
307GROUP DYNAMICS AND THE PUBLIC SPHEREHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 307regress to more immature modes of thinking, groups too can lose track of shades of
gray and jump to extremes.
What is meant by splitting?
One of Bion’s most valuable contributions was the concept of group splitting. Thisrefers to the times when groups split into hostile factions that represent different partsof their shared experience. There are many examples of this. The part of the group thatwants change can split against the part that wants to stay the same. The followers ofone leader split against the followers of a rival. There may be a split between supportersand opponents of a controversial group member. These splits can become very antago-nistic and a previously harmonious group can suddenly erupt into civil war. At somepoint just about everybody will encounter these kinds of splits in their everyday life,perhaps in a work situation, a family conflict, or even within a religious community.
It is important to recognize that these splits reflect a group dynamic and are not
simply a product of individual behavior. When people can identify fractures like theseas a group process instead of the fault of misbehaving individuals, they can reduce theinevitable blaming and finger pointing and work to restore the group’s cohesion.
How is splitting related to group polarization?
Group polarization refers to the tendency of groups to take more extreme positions
than individuals do when on their own. This has been attributed to various factors. Therole of social pressure is clearly an important factor. Leon Festinger suggested that peo-ple compare their own positions with their peers, and then act to avoid deviating fromthe group norm. This pushes the group as a whole toward more extreme positions.Other researchers, such as Eugene Bernstein and Amiram Vinokur, have suggested thatthe greater amount of information gathered from group discussions leads groups to bemore confident in their opinions than individuals who can only rely on their ownknowledge. However, group polarization occurs even when group members do notshare information. We can see how the process of group polarization can intensifysplitting. Once a fracture has occurred within a group, the two new groups are liable topolarize into extreme positions. This, of course, only strengthens the split.
PREJUDICE AND RACISM
How do we define prejudice and racism ?
Prejudice and racism reflect some of the negative aspects of group psychology. As theyhave caused enormous suffering across history, it is very important to understand howthey work. Prejudice and racism both refer to a negative view of one group of people
308Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 308based solely on their membership in that group. Rupert Brown defines prejudice as a
derogatory attitude, negative emotion, or discriminatory behavior toward members ofan out-group because of membership in that out-group. Racism is a specific form of
prejudice, involving prejudicial attitudes or behavior toward members of an ethnicgroup. The definition of race is somewhat variable, but commonly refers to an ethnicgroup originating on a specific continent, such as people of African, European, orAsian descent. Social psychologists have long been interested in the phenomenon ofprejudice and have contributed much to our understanding of it.
What is stereotyping and how does it relate to social prejudice?
Stereotyping goes hand-in-hand with prejudice. The term stereotype as used in social
science was first introduced by the journalist Walter Lippman in 1922. Previously, theterm had been used in the printing business. When we stereotype people, we attribute aseries of traits to them based on the one trait that signals their membership in a particu-lar group. Common contemporary stereotypes are that Asians are hardworking and stu-dious, Hispanics are macho, and that librarians are introverts. By definition, stereotypesare limiting and disregard each person’s individuality. They also lend themselves to neg-ative and derogatory assumptions. When that happens, the stereotype blends into preju-dice. Certainly, prejudice is highly dependent on stereotypes. You are unlikely to say youhate Hmong Cambodians unless you have some set view of what you think they are like.
How does our tendency to categorize lend itself to stereotyping?
The tendency to classify our experience into categories is a fundamental and universalaspect of human cognition. We create concepts in order to make sense of the endlesscomplexity we encounter in our environment. This is a necessary part of humanthought, allowing us to process information efficiently and quickly. If we did not cre-ate categories, our entire life would be a buzzing mass of confusion. In social catego-rization, we place people into categories.
Social categorization is a critical part of our social life and is evident as early as
infancy. Studies have shown that infants can distinguish people according to theirgender, age, and degree of familiarity. People also reflexively distinguish members ofin-groups (groups of which the subject is a member) from members of out-groups.Furthermore, people tend to minimize differences within groups and to maximize dif-
ferences between them. Finally, people tend to evaluate out-groups more negatively
than in-groups. In this way, social categories easily lend themselves to stereotypes ingeneral, and to negative stereotypes in particular.
What impact does stereotyping have on people’s reasoning?
Stereotyping creates automatic and unconscious biases that influence decision mak-ing. People frequently do not recognize that they are thinking in a stereotypical way,
309GROUP DYNAMICS AND THE PUBLIC SPHEREHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 309310and assume that their views of various out-groups are based on solid information.
Likewise, stereotypes are often quite persistent, even in the face of contradictory infor-mation. This occurs because people favor information confirming the stereotype andare more likely to ignore or disregard information contradicting the stereotype.
Furthermore, stereotypes are often self-serving and help people in powerful in-
groups rationalize their privileged position relative to less privileged out-groups. Forcenturies women were depicted as emotional and childish and African Americans aslazy and unintelligent. More recently, homosexuals have been portrayed as sexuallypredatory (and thus a threat to our schools and our military).
Such views justify the exclusion of these out-groups from power and privilege.
Stereotypes are not all powerful, however, and can be somewhat flexible. Our tendencyto stereotype can also be shaped by cues in the environment. For example, whenresearch subjects were cued to pay attention to gender, they thought in terms of gen-der stereotypes. This tendency was less evident when gender cues were removed.
What impact does stereotyping have on the stereotyped?
The impact of negative stereotyping on the stereotyped is quick, pervasive, anddestructive. In laboratory experiments, people can begin to act in concert with theirstereotype, even when the stereotype was arbitrarily assigned to them. In real life,when stereotypes are consistently encountered over a lifetime, people can easily inter-nalize the negative messages. In fact, people have to struggle hard notto see them-
selves through the eyes of the stereotyper, and not to act in the way that they are per-ceived. A famous study by Kenneth and Mamie Clark in the 1940s showed the tragicimpact of racial prejudice on the self-concept of African-American children.
How are intergroup relations relevant to an understanding of social
prejudice?
Ultimately, social prejudice is about intergroup relations. People are prejudicedagainst other people because of their membership in a particular group. Understand-ing the dynamics of intergroup relations can help shed light on social prejudice.
What are the main causes of intergroup strife?
This is a difficult question and there have been many theories about the causes of inter-group strife. Unfortunately, there is no one theory that totally accounts for the relation-ships between different groups. One theory holds that social prejudice stems from frus-tration caused by deprivation of needed resources. Another view suggests that groupsdevalue each other when their goals are in conflict. Other research points to the natureof group identity in itself as a contributor to intergroup tension. As soon as people self-identify as part of one group, they tend to think more negatively about other groups.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 310How did Kenneth and Mamie Clark use dolls to demonstrate the
effect of racism on African American children’s self-concept?
During research conducted in the
1940s, Kenneth and Mamie Clark
investigated the impact of racism onAfrican American children’s self-con-cept. Children were presented withtwo types of plastic baby dolls. Thedolls were identical except for skincolor; some were white and somewere black. As expected, the childrenwere all able to distinguish the raceof the dolls. More importantly, thechildren tended to prefer the whitedoll over the black doll, attributingmore positive characteristics to thewhite doll. Furthermore, when askedto draw a self-portrait, many of thechildren drew themselves with muchlighter skin than they actually had.This research was used in the 1954Supreme Court case Brown vs. Boardof Education , Topeka, Kansas. In this
landmark case, the U.S. SupremeCourt declared racial segregation inpublic schools to be unconstitutional.
Research in the 1940s showed that black children seemed to
prefer Caucasian over African American dolls, a finding thathelped win a U.S. Supreme Court case that outlawed schoolsegregation (iStock).GROUP DYNAMICS AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE
311Is in-group chauvinism natural?
Some capacity for favoritism of one’s own group over others appears to be a natural
human tendency. In many studies, people attribute more positive traits to their owngroup than to other groups. This has been demonstrated cross-culturally. In 1976Marilynn Brewer and Donald Campbell published a survey of thirty tribal groups inEast Africa. Their subjects had been asked to rate their own tribe and other tribes on aseries of traits. Twenty-seven of the thirty groups rated their own group more positive-ly than any other group.
In-group favoritism or chauvinism can also be created in experimental research.
In a series of classic studies published in the 1950s and 1960s, Muzafer and CarolynSherif and their colleagues recruited a group of twelve-year-old boys to attend aHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 311summer camp. The boys were divided into two teams which were then pitted against
each other in competitive games. Following these games, the boys very clearly dis-played in-group chauvinism. They consistently rated their team’s performance assuperior to that of the other team. Furthermore, 90 percent of the boys identifiedtheir best friends from within their own group even though, prior to group assign-ment, many had best friends in the other group. In some cases, the devaluing of theout-group started immediately after group assignment, even before the competitivegames began.
How do group goals affect intergroup relations?
A major theory of intergroup conflict addresses the role of group goals. When thegoals of two groups are in conflict with each other, there is likely to be an escalation oftension. Moreover, group chauvinism will kick in, and people will start to evaluate theother group in exaggeratedly negative terms while idealizing their own group. A num-ber of studies show that perceived conflict of interest between groups heightens both anegative view of the out-group and in-group cohesion. As this tension escalates, thegroups further polarize, taking more extreme positions against each other. The out-group becomes evil and badly intentioned, while the in-group remains morally decentand justified in their behavior. We can see this in many political situations, such as thecurrent impasse between the Israelis and the Palestinians, who are fighting over thesame land. On the other hand, when groups share goals, inter-group tension andgroup chauvinism decreases.
Do shared goals improve intergroup relations?
One important way to decrease intergroup prejudice is to introduce shared goals. Inthe summer camp experiments mentioned above, when the teams engaged in cooper-ative efforts toward shared goals, aggression towards the opposite team declined, asdid in-group favoritism. Several other studies have shown a similar effect. However,success in meeting shared goals may play an important role. Failure can raise tensionsagain, especially if there is a prior history of conflict or competition between thegroups. It is as if the groups want to blame each other for the failure.
Where does deprivation come in?
The earliest theory of intergroup aggression, as presented by John Dollard in 1939,focused on the role of deprivation. Groups grew angry because they felt deprived oftheir basic needs. This aggression was then expressed either toward the perceivedsource of their deprivation or toward a convenient target, in other words a scapegoat.Later authors, such as Leonard Berkowitz and Ted Robert Gurr, revised this theory.Intergroup aggression did not arise so much out of actual deprivation but more from
relative deprivation. In other words, it was not how much people had that mattered,
312Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 312but how much they had relative to a norm or expectation of how much they thought
they should have. This notion is consistent with research on the relationship between
money and happiness. In either case, our emotional response is less about what weactually have than about what we believe we should have.
How are norms of deprivation developed?
So how do we develop norms of what we think we should have? To some degree, ournorms are based on past experience. Groups whose conditions have deteriorated overtime can become aggressive to other groups. A more powerful source of comparison,however, appears to be other groups. Groups who feel deprived relative to othergroups around them are likely to become angry, which can lead to civil unrest. Fur-ther, in a 1972 paper by Reeve Vanneman and Thomas Pettigrew, a distinction wasmade between collective deprivation and egoistic deprivation.
In collective deprivation, people feel that their own group is deprived relative to
another group. In egoistic deprivation, people feel deprived as an individual, but not interms of group membership. Several studies have shown that feelings of collectivedeprivation are more strongly related to social prejudice. However, double deprivation,
the feeling that one is deprived both as an individual and as a member of a group, leadsto the highest level of social prejudice.
Where does scapegoating come in?
When scapegoating takes place, a stronger group takes out its aggression on a weaker
group. In effect, the group displaces their anger at whatever difficulty they may beexperiencing onto a convenient and defenseless target. This process refers to between-
group scapegoating. Psychoanalytically oriented group theorists also talk about with-
in-group scapegoating, which may be a somewhat different matter.
Although scapegoating cannot explain all of social prejudice, we can certainly
think of examples when it played an important role. One example would be the riseof Hitler and Nazism in Germany that followed the devastation of World War I. Ger-many faced defeat, followed by extremely punitive conditions imposed by the Treatyof Versaille; this wrecked the German economy and unnecessarily humiliated aonce-proud nation. In an attempt to rebuild German pride and group identity, Hitlerused the Jews as a scapegoat, blaming them for all of Germany’s troubles. The resultwas the Holocaust.
In another example of scapegoating, a 1940 study by Carl Hovland and Robert
Sears looked at the relationship between the price of cotton and the number of lynch-ings of African Americans that took place in the American South between 1882 and1930. A negative or inverse correlation was found: the number of lynchings increasedas the economy declined.
313GROUP DYNAMICS AND THE PUBLIC SPHEREHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 313How do we reduce social prejudice?
Given our diverse and multi-ethnic
world, it is of great importance to under-stand ways to reduce social prejudice. Inthe 1950s, Gordon Allport introducedthe intergroup-contact hypothesis. Inthis view, intergroup contact under posi-tive conditions can reduce social preju-dice. The necessary conditions includecooperation toward shared goals, equalstatus between groups, and the supportof local authorities and cultural norms.Considerable research since then hassupported these ideas. In a 2003 review,Stephen Wright and Donald Taylor alsonoted the effectiveness of identificationwith a superordinate group. In otherwords, different groups can cometogether as part of one overarchinggroup, for example, as part of one com-munity or of a common humanity.
Do cross-group friendships reduce
social prejudice?
Positive emotional experiences with members of different groups can also reduce neg-
ative stereotypes. Having close friends from different groups is especially effective inthis regard. There may be several reasons for this. For one, it is near impossible tohold onto a simplistic, negative stereotype of someone you know well. Secondly, aclose relationship promotes identification with the other person and of the groupsthey belong to. In other words, your relationships with other people become part ofwho you are. This is referred to as including the other in the self, a notion introduced
by Stephen Wright, Arthur Aron, and colleagues.
MORALITY
How do psychologists understand morality?
Morality involves judgments between right and wrong. Morality is determined both byour reason, that is, by our cognitive analysis, and by our emotional response. Psychol-

mining what is and what is not moral—the content of moral decisions—psychological
research studies the process of moral decisions and judgments. How do people deter-mine what is and what is not morally acceptable?
Can psychology determine what moral choices should be?
In short—no. It is not the place of science to make moral decisions. Morality is ulti-mately about value, about what is right and what is wrong. Psychology is a science andtherefore does not deal in the realm of value. That is the role of philosophy or of reli-gion. However, psychology can provide information on how various behaviors affectother people, on the psychological impact of various choices. This information, inturn, can allow individuals and society to make informed moral decisions. Relatedly,
we can study the process of moral choices and moral development; how people makemoral decisions, what morality means to different people. Hopefully this can also helppeople enhance their moral decision-making abilities, so that they make morethoughtful, mature, and beneficial moral decisions.
How does morality relate to the social group?
Without morality, group life would not be possible. Morality is what holds groupstogether. It is the glue. If everybody simply acted out of self-interest with no concerneither for other people or for the wellbeing of the group at large, the group wouldquickly dissolve into a free-for-all. Human beings have evolved with powerful self-pro-tective and self-promoting motivations and drives. A good part of our motivations areentirely selfish; our desires, angers, and fears serve to promote our own individualinterests, often at the expense of other people. Sometimes this erupts in horrificexploitation of, or even violence against, others. On the other hand, humans have alsoevolved as social animals. We are powerfully oriented toward social organization andmost of our emotions serve social functions. Along with our self-serving motivations,we have also evolved moral capacities. Some sense that we must balance our owninterest with the interests of others is deeply encoded in our genes.
In what ways does morality have an evolutionary basis?
Early students of morality, such as Jean Piaget (1896–1980) and Lawrence Kohlberg(1927–1987), focused on the intellectual aspect of moral development. They studiedthe role of reason in moral judgments. Carol Gilligan protested this narrow focus andemphasized the importance of compassion and caring. More recent psychologists,such as Steven Pinker, emphasize an evolutionary approach to human morality. In a2008 article, Pinker noted that some of our most strongly held moral positions maynot have any basis in reasoning or compassion. For example, many people react inhorror when hearing scenarios in which an adult brother and sister engage in mutual-
315GROUP DYNAMICS AND THE PUBLIC SPHEREHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 315316ly consensual incest, a dog owner eats the family dog after it has died from natural
causes, or a homeowner cuts up the American flag to use as a dust rag. (These scenar-ios were first described by the psychologist Jonathan Haidt.)
From research such as this, psychologists have concluded that evolution has
inscribed in us the tendency to react with emotional disgust or horror at certain classesof situations. Such situations have evolutionary significance and involve behaviors that,over time, are destructive to our species. For example, the incest taboo is observed inmany animal species and serves to protect variability in the gene pool. An aversion toeating members of our own family (and our pets become part of our family) has obvi-ous benefits for kinship survival. In effect, we have evolved certain moral instincts.
What are the five categories of moral instincts?
Cross-cultural research has shown consistent themes to moral judgments, even acrossvery different cultures. Jonathan Haidt suggested five general categories of moral con-cerns. These are harm/care, ingroup/loyalty, authority/respect, purity/sanctity , and
fairness/reciprocity . Across cultures, people express disapproval and distress at the
thought of harm coming to an innocent person. Betrayal of one’s community is like-wise judged negatively. A respect for authority and the value of fair treatment formembers of the community also appear to be cultural universals. The purity/sanctitycategory relates to the emotion of disgust and involves moral judgments about dietarylaws, sexual practices, urination, defecation, and other similar issues.
How do we account for the extreme variation in the moral beliefs of people?
It does not take much life experience to recognize that human beings can disagree pas-sionately about moral choices. Contemporary debates about abortion and gay marriageshow that people can hold completely opposite viewpoints with equal degrees of moralconviction. One way of understanding this is to assume that different people and differ-ent groups vary in the way they rank the five categories. For example, respect forauthority is more highly valued in collectivist cultures than in individualist cultures,which might in turn prioritize fairness. This can explain the intense cultural dividebetween traditional Islamic cultures and Western European cultures over the 2005 con-troversy regarding a Danish cartoon about the prophet Mohammed. The Islamic side feltit was a moral transgression for the cartoonist to ridicule the Islamic prophet (authori-ty/respect and ingroup/loyalty), while the Europeans felt the cartoonist had a moralright to free expression (fairness/reciprocity) without fear of violence (harm/care).
Do political liberals and conservatives differ in the way they understand morality?
Attitudes toward the five categories of moral concerns may also influence politicalbeliefs. In a large Website-based study, Jonathan Haidt and colleagues found that, whenHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 316How has morality changed over the course of history?
Despite scientific evidence of a uni-
versal human tendency toward
moral judgments, views on moralityhave changed dramatically across his-tory. Things we now consider to behorribly immoral were not alwaysseen that way. The ancient Greeksbased their morality on the concept ofhonor, which was related to one’s rep-utation for bravery and strength. Inthe quest for honor, it was perfectlyacceptable to slaughter whole cities.More recently, in fact well into thenineteenth century, slavery was notconsidered immoral in the UnitedStates. Moreover, behavior once seenas highly immoral is no longer seenthat way by many people. Pre-maritalsex was seen as highly immoral only afew decades ago and now is widelyconsidered acceptable. Likewise,there is far more tolerance of publicdisagreement with people in authori-ty than there used to be. If we consid-er these changes in light of JonathanHaidt’s five moral categories, we cansee that within Western society con-siderations of fairness/reciprocity have grown stronger while considerations ofauthority/respect and ingroup/loyalty have lessened.

317liberals and conservatives were compared with each other, liberals valued harm/care
and fairness/reciprocity more than conservatives did, and conservatives valued authori-ty/respect, ingroup/loyalty, and purity/sanctity more than liberals did. These differencesheld even after accounting for the effects of age, gender, education, and income.
How does morality relate to the capacity to reason?
The ability to analyze a situation with reason, or cognition, is a critical part of moraljudgments. Earlier theorists of moral development, such as Piaget and Kohlberg,Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 317emphasized the importance of cognitive development in moral maturity. Two specific
cognitive skills include: the ability to take another person’s perspective (that is to putyourself in another’s shoes), and the ability to recognize abstract rules that can begeneralized across many situations. Similar ideas are reflected in many philosophers’ideas about morality. For example, Immanuel Kant (1724–1804), a famous Germanphilosopher, introduced the concept of the categorical imperative, which refers to theimportance of recognizing universally valid rules of behavior. Certainly the GoldenRule, to “do unto others as you would have them do unto you,” assumes that we cantake another person’s perspective. As developmental psychologists have shown, thesecognitive abilities develop slowly across childhood and continue to develop acrossadulthood. Because children have an immature capacity for either abstraction or per-spective taking, they are not held to the same moral standards as adults.
How does morality relate to empathy?
Empathy is also a central part of our moral reactions. Our ability to feel another’spain, and to imagine our own pain if put in the same situation, underlies our concernfor the well-being of others. People who are deficient in empathy, such as psychopathsor some people with autistic traits, can behave in immoral ways. The extent to whicheither empathy or rational analysis influences our moral decisions depends on the sit-uation. If we have direct, personal contact with the people affected by our decisions,we are much more likely to be influenced by empathy and emotion than if we have

on the “Trolley Problem” has shown us how much circumstances influence whetherempathy or reason will dominate our moral decisions.
What parts of the brain are involved in moral responses?
As discussed above, moral judgments involve both emotions and cognition, and theimportance of either one will depend on the particular circumstances involved. JoshuaGreene, Jonathan Cohen, and colleagues asked people to consider the trolley problemand similar scenarios while undergoing fMRI brain imaging. The authors divided theirmoral dilemmas into moral-personal and moral-impersonal scenarios.
The trolley scenario that required killing someone directly (i.e., pushing the
large man in front of the trolley) is an example of a moral-personal scenario. Thetrolley problem that did not demand direct, physical contact with the man whowould be killed (i.e., pulling the switch) is an example of a moral-impersonal sce-nario. When people thought about moral-personal scenarios, the medial frontal andanterior cingulate regions lit up. The medial frontal region is associated with theprocessing of interpersonal relations and, possibly, empathy. The anterior cingulateis associated with processing conflicting messages from different parts of the brain.When people considered the moral-impersonal scenarios, the dorsolateral frontalregions were most active. The dorsolateral frontal region is involved with rationalthought and analysis.
319GROUP DYNAMICS AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE
What is the “trolley problem”?
Aseries of studies have been done on the “trolley problem”, which is a moraldilemma first thought up by the philosophers Philippa Foot and Judith
Jarvis Thomson. The scenario involves a trolley that is hurtling down the trackout of control after the trolley driver has become unconscious. If nothing isdone, the trolley will hit five workmen on the tracks who don’t see the oncomingtrolley. You can save the workmen by throwing a switch that will divert the trol-ley onto another track. However, there is one workman on the other track. Willyou throw the switch, sacrificing one man to save five others?
In these circumstances, most people say yes. From a purely rational stand-
point, it makes sense. However, if the only way to save the five workmen is tothrow a large man in front of the trolley, most people say they would not do it.When we have close contact with the person we are hurting, our moral decisionsare likely to be based more on emotion than on reason alone. Likewise, whenpeople considered these two scenarios during fMRI brain imaging, differentparts of the brain lit up for each scenario.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 319320This suggests that the farther away we are from the human cost of our actions,
the more our moral decisions are based on cold rational analysis, rather than gut
emotion. These kind of rational moral decisions are known as utilitarian judgments ,
and involve a kind of cost/benefit analysis.
At what age do children start understanding moral issues?
Children start showing a rudimentary sense of moral understanding around four yearsold, during the preschool years. Their initial sense of right and wrong is quite crude,and based mainly on what adults tell them or what behavior has brought punishment.A few years later, when children are about seven, they begin to grasp the importance ofuniversal rules to govern behavior. Initially, they apply rules in simplistic and rigidways (“Ooh, you said ‘stupid’! You’re not supposed to say ‘stupid’!”). With time, theydevelop a better understanding of the purpose that rules serve. Nonetheless, somecapacity to respond to the feelings of others is evident as early as infancy, and evenfour-year-olds can distinguish between prohibitions that serve a true moral purpose,such as protecting people from harm, and those that simply express a preference, suchas not sitting on the couch.
What is Lawrence Kohlberg’s approach to moral development ?
Kohlberg (1927–1987) was a pioneer in the field of moral development. Influencedby Jean Piaget, he developed a large body of research investigating moral reason-ing. Like Piaget, he was interested in intellectual development, in the way that theability to reason changes across development. Kohlberg relied on a method ofvignettes. He wrote up scenarios that involved a moral dilemma and presentedthem to his research subjects. His best known vignette involves a man namedHeinz who broke into a pharmacy to steal a drug in order to save his wife’s life.Based on his research, Kohlberg divided moral development into three levels, pre-
conventional, conventional, and post-conventional. Each level contains two stages,
for a total of six stages altogether.
The first level, pre-conventional morality , is most commonly found in children
under ten. In this level, morality is determined by the consequences of the action tothe person performing the behavior—whether the individual is punished or rewarded.In the second level, conventional morality , the morality of a behavior is determined
by its effect on social relationships. The third and final level is called post-convention-
al morality . In this stage, the person is interested in abstract concepts of justice and a
just society. Kohlberg believed that all children go through the same sequence ofstages in the same order. A fair amount of research supports this view for the first twolevels, but the scientific evidence for the third level is much weaker. Kohlberg was alsointerested in moral reasoning in adults. Indeed, research has shown that differentadults are characterized by different stages of moral development.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 320Why is it so easy to rationalize immoral behavior?
Financier Bernie Madoff perpetrat-
ed the largest Ponzi scheme in his-
tory. Although Madoff was a widelyrespected member of his communityand a devoted family man, he defraud-ed friends, family, colleagues, andmany charities of approximately $50billion. Did Madoff justify his behaviorto himself as he did it? We do notknow, but we can imagine he mightwell have. We do know, however, thatpeople rationalize and justify theirmoral transgressions all the time. Infact, the very nature of cognitionmakes it inherently easy to justifybehavior that is clearly against ourmoral code.
Cognition is never isolated from
emotion. Emotion slants everythought we have and does so largelyoutside of consciousness. In otherwords, emotions bias our interpreta-tion of events; we tend to interpretemotionally significant events inways that are consistent with ouremotions. Moreover, desire colorsour thoughts as much as any otheremotion. If we want something to be true, we often convince ourselves it is true.That’s why it is generally necessary to have some form of external check on ourbehavior; few people are up to the task of policing themselves.

321How did Carol Gilligan challenge Kohlberg ’s approach to moral development?
Carol Gilligan believed that Kohlberg’s theory was biased by an exclusively masculine
viewpoint. She suggested that his emphasis on abstract thought and impersonal lawsreflected a typically masculine bias to favor thought over emotion. Gilligan claimed thatwomen are more likely to emphasize emotions and interpersonal relationships thanmen and, therefore, more likely to score at stage 3 (the first stage in conventional moral-Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 321ity). This did not mean that women were less moral than men, only that they made
moral judgments in different ways. In effect, women made moral choices “in a differentvoice”, which was the title of her 1982 book. While Gilligan’s critique raises importantpoints about Kohlberg’s exclusive focus on intellect, she also has been criticized foroversimplifying the female style of moral reasoning. Other research has shown thatwomen are no more likely to score at stage 3 than men. In general, both women andmen take issues of justice and empathy into account when making moral decisions.
PSYCHOLOGY IN THE WORKPLACE
How do group dynamics impact the workplace?
It is in the workplace where we are perhaps most exposed to the ups-and-downs ofgroup dynamics. Office politics, issues of leadership, productivity, and staff morale–allof these reflect group processes. The field of study that specializes in group dynamicsin the workplace is known as organizational psychology.
What is an organization?
An organization is a group of people who join together in an organized manner for acommon purpose. Although this can refer to any group united in a common purpose(for example, a religious, social, or community organization), in this context organi-
zations refer to those groups that unite for the purpose of paid work.
How do organizations differ?
Organizations vary in two important ways: size and degree of hierarchy. Organizationscan be very small (like a five-person start-up company), or enormous (like an interna-tional conglomerate with a workforce of thirty thousand people). Small organizationstend to be more informally organized, while larger organizations depend on greaterstandardization of policies and procedures. Organizations also vary in terms of thedegree of hierarchy. In nonhierarchical organizations, there is no power differentialbetween members. An example of this would be a cooperative or a Quaker religiouscommunity. In these entirely nonhierarchical organizations, decisions are made by con-sensus only. The decision is not made until the entire organization comes to agreement.
Hierarchical organizations organize decision making and power vertically. Subor-
dinates report to superiors, who in turn report to their own superiors. This chain con-tinues up the hierarchy until the very top. Strongly hierarchical organizations includethe U.S. military and the Catholic church. Most work organizations fall somewherebetween these two extremes. However, the majority of large commercial organizationshave a fairly hierarchical structure.
322Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 322What is organizational psychology ?
Organizational psychology is the study of human behavior and relationships within
work organizations. Organizational psychologists study how the structure of an orga-nization influences company performance, productivity, and morale, as well as work-er-worker relationships. While organizational psychologists are interested in individ-ual traits and behaviors, they are also interested in the larger picture—how the groupdynamics of organizations impact the organization’s performance. Because large cor-porations have been the most frequent consumers of this kind of information, mostorganizational psychology research has been conducted in fairly traditional corporateenvironments. Nonetheless, the insights of organizational psychology can be fruitfullyapplied to a large array of work environments.
What are the classic theories of organization?
Classic theories of organizational psychology date back to the late nineteenth century.Writing in an age of massive industrialization, early theorists of organizational structureaimed to replicate the precision of a finely tuned machine. Frederick Winslow Taylor(1856–1915) introduced the notion of scientific management. He believed that the meth-ods of empirical science should be adapted to engineer efficiency in the workplace. Hiswork influenced the development of factory assembly lines. Another pioneer in this arenawas Max Weber (1864–1920), a renowned German sociologist. While Taylor focused onthe structure of tasks, Weber focused on the authority structure. Weber idealized the pre-cision and control of a hierarchically organized bureaucracy. His aim was to standardizeworker behavior and company policies into a completely impersonal, rule-bound system.
What about the human element?
Both Weber’s and Taylor’s organizational models treated the workplace as a machine.Workers were cogs in a wheel; their motivation and morale were of little importanceto the functioning of the workplace. In fact, Taylor believed that workers had nointrinsic motivation to work. Rather, their performance could only be motivated bycarrots (specifically, pay) and sticks (negative consequences for undesirable behavior).Likewise, Weber emphasized the rational and impersonal nature of bureaucratic rulesas an antidote to irrational, emotional impulses.
A movement arose in reaction to this dramatically dehumanizing model. The
human relations approach recognized that people are motivated by their emotional and
social needs as well by monetary rewards. Organizations that neglect the human ele-ment miss out on a huge part of what makes people tick. The surprise results of afamous series of experiments known as the Hawthorne studies gave birth to this move-
ment. Nonetheless, while a focus on emotional experiences of workers succeeded in rais-ing worker morale, studies showed that it had little effect on productivity. A later versionof this approach, the neo-human relations school , recognized that managers have to
attend both to task performance and to the social-emotional aspects of work life.
323GROUP DYNAMICS AND THE PUBLIC SPHEREHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 323What does a systems approach involve?
The systems approach draws from Ludwig von Bertolanffy’s 1967 work on general sys-
tems theory. In this view, organizations are seen more like living organisms than likemachines. A system is a whole made up of interacting parts. Systems are composed ofinteracting subsystems (e.g., departments, divisions, work groups, teams). It is therelationships between the subsystems that make up the structure of the system.Therefore systems theory is particularly focused on relationships among individuals
and groups within the work setting. While the classic organizational theories assumedthat all members of the organization shared the same goals, systems approaches rec-ognize that different subsystems can have very different interests and agendas.
What about office politics?
Although questions of productivity may be of most interest to upper management,most employees are interested in the daily life of the workplace. Office politics marksan inescapable and sometimes very difficult part of such day-to-day work life. In their1998 review, Erik Andriessen and Pieter Drenth discuss the multiple parties model ,
which came of age in the 1970s and was influenced by a Marxist theory of manage-ment-worker relations. This approach emphasizes the competition for power thatoften goes on within an organization.
324What is the “Hawthorne Effect”?
In the 1920s and 1930s, a series of studies was carried out in the Hawthorne fac-tory of the Western Electric Company in Chicago. The experiment was conduct-
ed from the vantage point of Frederick Winslow Taylor’s theory of scientific man-agement. The experimenters manipulated working conditions in a number ofways to determine what conditions would best enhance productivity. They attend-ed to the temperature and level of humidity in the room, the hours worked, theamount of sleep the workers had, their meals, and various other variables.
After a year or two of this, performance greatly improved. This was at first
attributed to the experimental manipulations (e.g., changing the level of light inthe room). However, when working conditions were returned to their originalstate, the improvement continued. The experimenters finally realized that theimprovement in worker performance was due less to changes in task conditionsthan to the human element inherent in the studies. While conducting thesestudies, the experimenters continually consulted the workers and paid carefulattention to almost every detail of their work life. Because of this, workers feltvalued and empowered, which greatly enhanced their work performance.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 324Where does power come in?
Power offers numerous privileges, in particular, greater control over one’s life, which
is highly correlated with life satisfaction. Power also offers social status, which formany people is an end in itself. There are several avenues to power in the workplace,including control over the distribution of rewards and punishments (authority), pro-fessional expertise, or the use of personal charm. Because the pursuit of power is sucha potent and frequent motivator, there is often competition between different subsys-tems over access to power, or even access to the symbols of power.
Consider how different departments or divisions can fight over office space, con-
trol over budgets, hiring decisions, and even status symbols such as the corner office.Of course, such competition can occur among smaller units within these subsystems,such as individuals or coalitions of individuals. Likewise, in pursuit of power or in anattempt to maintain power, people frequently build alliances and coalitions. One’s net-work of alliances is a powerful tool within office politics. However, it is important torecognize that much of this maneuvering is not conscious, and deliberate calculationmay play a small part of this behavior.
Does the degree of hierarchy affect the motivation for power ?
We can speculate that the quest for power is heightened in strongly hierarchical sys-tems. When power differentials are more acute, people become more aware of havingless power than other people and are more disturbed by their relative lack of power. Aswe know from a broad range of research, whether people are satisfied or dissatisfiedwith what they have is strongly impacted by social comparison, by the contrastbetween what they have and what others around them have.
How important is leadership?
Leaders are certainly important and a large body of literature shows how leaders canimpact absenteeism, morale, turnover, group productivity, decision making, and evencompany profits. However when considering group performance, the qualities of theleader do not tell the whole story. Sometimes groups are largely autonomous, function-ing with very little active leadership. Sometimes external factors, such as organization-al structure and culture or larger economic conditions, can constrain a leader’s impact.
Are there certain personality traits that make a better leader?
Earlier research studied the personality traits that contributed to effective leadership.Ultimately this research came up empty handed. The data was simply too contradictoryto lead to any firm conclusions about what kinds of personality traits make for a betterleader. What does seem important, however, is the fit between leadership style and the
nature of the task. Different kinds of leadership are necessary in different situations.
325GROUP DYNAMICS AND THE PUBLIC SPHEREHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 325What role does charisma play?
A repeated theme since the early days of Max Weber is the notion of the charismatic
leader. A charismatic personality is not necessary in most managerial situations, butcan come in handy in times of turmoil when workers need to be inspired and reas-sured about the need for significant changes in their values, goals, and group norms.This kind of leadership has been called transformational leadership.
What is the difference between task-oriented and socio-emotional
leadership styles?
A task-oriented leader focuses on the most efficient ways to accomplish the goals ofthe group, whether that is to maximize sales, treat patients in a hospital, or producethe greatest number of widgets. The task-oriented leader does this by clarifying thegroup’s goals, delineating each worker’s responsibilities, and addressing any barriersto goal completion. A socioemotional leader addresses the overall morale of the groupmembers. This includes consideration of group cohesion and morale, the emotionsand needs of individual workers, and within-group relationships. Research shows thattask orientation promotes efficiency, whereas a socio-emotional focus promotes work-er satisfaction. However, worker satisfaction and worker performance are not alwaysrelated. Therefore, most organizational psychologists conclude that leaders shouldattend to the demands of the task andto the socio-emotional needs of the work group.

be effective in times of turmoil ( iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 326How important is structure in the workplace?
One of the tasks of the leader is to create structure. Structure is a critical part of any
organization, which needs rules, policies, and clear roles in order to function. Howev-er, it is quite difficult to achieve the right balance between structure and flexibility.Not enough structure prevents efficient, coordinated efforts toward the group’s goals.It can also result in chaos, corruption, and abuse of power. Too much structure leavesthe organization inflexible and poorly adapted to change or to variability in local con-ditions. Because of this, a parallel underground system can develop outside the rulesof the formal structure. This is similar to the black markets that develop in countrieswhose economies are overly controlled.
How much should decision-making power be shared?
The extent to which decision making is shared with subordinates or concentrated atthe top of the hierarchy differs across organizations. Thus, organizations can varyfrom strongly centralized decision-making practices to highly participatory deci-sion-making practices. In participatory decision making, subordinates have muchmore input into how decisions are made. Research shows that greater participationin decision making improves employees’ satisfaction with the decisions, but doesnot necessarily translate into better group performance. Therefore, research hasinvestigated when participatory decision making is most useful, and when it is lessimportant. When the workers are highly educated, intelligent, and have consider-able expertise in their areas, participatory decision making is more effective. Addi-tionally, when the task at hand is highly complex and knowledge about local condi-tions is important to the decision, participatory decision making is important.Finally, in times of crisis, when the decisions have very strong impact, participatorydecision making is useful.
What did one study tell us about the fit between different leadership styles and
different decision-making conditions?
In a 1973 publication, Victor Vroom and Philip Yetton considered the circumstancesin which autocratic versus participatory decision making styles would be most effec-tive. They believed that there is no one-size-fits-all leadership style, but that leadershave to adapt to different situations. They listed seven characteristics that might influ-ence a decision, such as the amount of information needed to make the decision, thesignificance of the decision, employee support for the decision, and other relatedissues. They then made a decision tree based on the seven characteristics, resulting in12 possible situations. For each situation, they listed which of five decision-makingstyles (AI, AII, CI, CII, or GI) would be appropriate. CII was listed for 9 of the 12 situa-tions, while CI and GII were appropriate for 7 out of 12. Interestingly, the most auto-cratic styles, AI and AII, were only appropriate for three and five situations, respective-
327GROUP DYNAMICS AND THE PUBLIC SPHEREHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 327ly. In sum, this work suggests that consultative styles are appropriate for a broader
array of circumstances than are autocratic styles.

members

What motivates employees?
In his theory of scientific management, Frederick Winslow Taylor took an early behav-
iorist approach to motivation. He did not believe that employees had any intrinsic moti-vation to work, rather that people would only work for rewards (such as pay) or punish-ments (such as fear of being fired). The human relations approach considered theemotional and social needs of employees. Later organizational psychologists recognizedthat human motivation is complex. Influenced by Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs,various theorists came up with multifaceted theories of employees’ motivational needs.In 1972, Clayton Alderfer proposed a three-part model of worker motivation: existenceneeds (basic physical needs), relatedness needs (for social connection and support), andgrowth needs (for realizing their own potential, similar to Maslow’s self-actualizationneeds). In 1983, Wofford and Srinivasan suggested that worker performance reflectedfour factors: competence, motivation, role perception, and the limitations determinedby the setting. A manager’s job would be to address each issue as it became relevant.
What was Frederick Hertzberg’s approach to motivation?
In 1959, Frederick Hertzberg (1923–2000) and colleagues published their survey oftwo hundred mid-level engineers and accountants in a Pennsylvania company. Thesubjects were asked about the high points and the low points of their work life. Forhigh points, subjects frequently listed moments of accomplishment and recognition,increased challenge, promotion to a higher level of responsibility, and increasedautonomy. For low points, subjects complained of problems with managerial and poli-cy decisions of the company, recognition, salary, and relations with superiors.
Hertzberg interpreted these results to mean that causes of job satisfaction were
intrinsic to the job (inherent within the work itself) while causes of job dissatisfaction
were extrinsic (due to context). He integrated these insights into his two-factor theory
of worker motivation, also known as the motivation-hygiene theory . Over the years,
the study was repeated multiple times in different settings.
328Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 328A consistent finding was that people attributed positive outcomes to intrinsic or
internal causes (self-caused) and negative outcomes to extrinsic or external causes. In
other words, we credit ourselves for our successes and blame others for our disappoint-ments. Hertzberg’s findings have been highly influential in organizational psychology.
What are some dos and don’ts that managers should adhere to?
Drawing from the literature on organizational psychology, group dynamics, and fami-ly systems, we can put together a list of pointers:
Manager Dos
Identify and support appropriate boundaries in your work group:
 Clarify sub-system boundaries. Identify each employee’s responsibilities and
clarify boundaries between different employees’ roles, responsibilities, and deci-
sion making domains.
 Maintain in-group and out-group boundaries. Provide the buffer between your
work group and outside systems.
 Clarify group hierarchy. Be clear about who makes what decision and who
reports to whom.
Recognize positive behavior:
 Reward positive behavior. Verbal praise goes a long way. Over time, however,
employees will need more than just verbal praise, such as increased pay and
opportunities for growth and advancement.
Make sure employees’ responsibility is proportionate to their control:
 Nothing causes burn-out quicker than responsibility without control.
Listen to your employees:
 Information needs to flow upstream as well as downstream. Solicit your employ-
ees’ opinions and try to make them feel comfortable coming to you with problems.
Manager Don’ts
Pick favorites:
 Personal preferences are unavoidable but shouldn’t affect your behavior toward
subordinates. Rewards and punishments should be keyed to employees’ behav-
ior, not your likes and dislikes. The group needs the manager’s behavior to feelpredictable and fair.
Avoid setting limits when needed:
 If an employee is out of line, the manager has to respond and bring the employ-
ee’s behavior back into line. Don’t be afraid to be the bad guy or not to be liked.
329GROUP DYNAMICS AND THE PUBLIC SPHEREHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 329If your behavior is fair and appropriate, in time it will be appreciated by all
involved, even if the employee in question is unhappy in the moment. If you failto set the necessary limits, the group as a whole will suffer and you will losefavor with your group.
Undermine group hierarchy:
 To the extent that a hierarchy is defined in your group, it should be followed. Do
not undermine a supervisor by granting inappropriate power to his or her sub-
ordinates. If someone needs to be promoted, change the hierarchy formally.
Jump to conclusions when something goes wrong:
 Make sure you investigate the situation so you can diagnose the problem and
assign responsibility fairly. Don’t let your prejudices about different employees
lead to unfair assumptions about what went wrong.
How are different personality types suited for different types of jobs?
There is a large body of research examining how different personality types fit differ-ent types of jobs. The Strong-Campbell Interest Inventory is a well known test that
aims to match personal interests, personality types, and occupational choice. This andsimilar tests are used in vocational counseling to help people decide on a career direc-tion. According to their interests, people are characterized according to six personalitydimensions: realistic, investigative, artistic, social, enterprising, and conventional(RIASEC). The pattern of test scores is then matched to professions whose membershave similar patterns of test scores. For example, mechanics and construction workersscore high on realistic, biologists and social scientists score high on investigative, andclinical psychologists and high school teachers score high on social. Newer adapta-tions of this test, such as the Campbell Interest and Skill Survey and the Strong Inter-est Inventory, have also been developed.
What is the Myers-Briggs Personality Test?
Developed by Isabel Briggs Myers and her mother Katharine Briggs and first publishedin 1962, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator has become very popular in occupational set-tings. Based on Carl Jung’s theory of personality types, the Myers-Briggs classifies peo-ple into one of sixteen personality types depending on their scores on fourdichotomies (pairs of opposites).
The first dichotomy, extraversion (E) vs. introversion (I), measures the degree to
which someone is oriented toward the external, social world or toward their own innerthoughts and reflections. The second dimension, sensing (S) vs. intuition (N), refers tothe way people gather information: Do they focus on concrete facts, or do they try toorganize information into patterns? The third dimension, thinking (T) vs. feeling (F),
330Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 330relates to the way people make decisions: Do they focus more on facts and principles or
on interpersonal concerns? The final dimension, judging (J) vs. perceiving (P), relatesto the way that people come to closure: Do they prefer to come to a decision, or do theyprefer to keep their options open, continuing to gather new information?
The sixteen personality types are identified by their initials (e.g., ENTJ, INFP , ESFJ)
and have been linked to specific occupations. For example, people who score high onextraversion (E) might make good salespeople while people who score high on sensing(S) might make good mechanics. Although this test makes good intuitive sense—thatis, it appears to make sense–it has been criticized as lacking adequate scientific valida-tion. Despite these criticisms, the test remains very popular in many settings.
What are the personality traits of people who succeed in their professions?
Many factors contribute to one’s degree of success in a career. Some of these are exter-nal, such as opportunity, education, economic conditions, and professional connec-tions. However, there is evidence that certain personality traits also contribute to suc-cess. In a 2001 study of 291 Romanian engineers by Marcela Rodika Luca, creativityand self-management were better predictors of success than intelligence. Moreover,intelligence was more closely related to academic than professional success. Ofcourse, the sample was already self-selected for a high level of intelligence. Therefore,in jobs demanding high intellectual ability, after a certain level of intelligence is met,additional intelligence may not add much to the mix.
Several studies have addressed success orientation , suggesting that people who
want success aim for it, plan how to achieve it, and are willing to work for it. Addition-ally, based on the many studies that highlight the importance of human relations,good interpersonal skills are clearly important in the workplace. Finally, internal
locus of control , the tendency to believe one has the power to affect one’s situation,
also contributes to success. Research has shown that when people believe they havecontrol over their life circumstances, they are more likely to take action to reach theirgoals. In contrast, people with an external locus of control tend to be more passive.
What are some dos and don’ts for employees?
Drawing from the research literature, here is a list of survival tips for employees:
 Remember you are part of a system. You do not exist in isolation; you are part of
a large network that exists to serve the interests of the organization, whetherthat be making widgets, serving meals, or cutting hair. Your behavior affectsother people just as their behavior affects you.
 Understand what is expected of you and do it to the best of your ability. This may
seem obvious but it is surprisingly easy to forget.
331GROUP DYNAMICS AND THE PUBLIC SPHEREHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 331 If there is a problem with completing your responsibilities, let your supervisor
know. Don’t hide your deficits out of fear of looking bad. Most supervisors will
be willing to work with you if you need extra support or education, or if there’s a
problem in the system that interferes with your job. But no one likes unneces-sary surprises.
 Try to see situations from other points of view. This will reduce conflict with co-
workers and supervisors.
 Address your needs, preferences, and complaints from the point of view of a
member of a system. You need X, Y, or Z in order to do your job and be a produc-
tive member of the group. Do not say you need them because you’re you, you’respecial, or you’re smarter than everybody else.
 Address conflict in behavioral terms. “When you don’t return my e-mails, I am
unable to complete my assignments on time.” Try not to personalize, scapegoat,or practice character assassination. Just the facts, Ma’am.
 Try to keep conflict between you and the co-worker in question or take it to
your supervisor. Try not to triangulate in your buddies so you can all make snide
comments about your new enemy.
 In the face of office politics, try to separate out the temporary noise from your
job responsibilities. If you stick to doing your job, you will most likely end up all
right.
PSYCHOLOGY IN THE PUBLIC SPHERE
What role can psychology play in the public sphere ?
Traditionally, psychology focused on the private life of the individual, but over timethe field has broadened its scope. From Wilhelm Wundt’s (1832–1920) studies of per-ception in the late nineteenth century, psychology has moved to the study of thegroup, as seen, for example, in social and organizational psychology. More recently,psychology has moved into the public sphere, conducting studies on the personalitiesof politicians, voting behavior, and even ballot design.
Do politicians have particular personality traits?
Although there has not been much empirical research into the personality traits ofpoliticians, there has certainly been a lot of commentary on this topic from psychoan-alysts and other clinicians. The extensive media coverage of the lives of politiciansprovides ample opportunity for clinicians to make inferences about their psychologi-cal traits. The information in the media shares many similarities with the kind ofinformation that psychotherapists gain from their patients during the course of treat-
332Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 332ment. Notably, the conclusions that dif-
ferent clinicians draw are quite similar.One of the most common traits that clin-icians talk about is that of narcissism,maybe because the most active mediacoverage of politicians follows scandals.
What is narcissism?
In effect, narcissism refers to a very fragileand unstable sense of self. In order to com-pensate for their fragile self-esteem, narcis-sistic people become preoccupied with theirself-image and intensely sensitive to per-ceived shame or humiliation. Typical nar-cissists have a grandiose sense of self, withan inflated sense of self-importance and anelevated need for attention, status, andrecognition. More recent research hasfocused upon a kind of reverse narcissism,in which people are tormented by poor self-esteem, but harbor grandiose expectationsof themselves. The Diagnostic and Statisti-
cal Manual, fourth edition (DSM-IV orDSM-IV-TR) lists nine criteria for the diag-nosis of narcissistic personality disorder.
What are the DSM-IV-TR criteria for Narcissistic Personality Disorder?
Published in 2000 by the American Psychiatric Association, the DSM-IV Text Revision(DSM-IV-TR) is the latest version of the DSM. In order to meet DSM-IV-TR criteria forNarcissistic Personality Disorder, an individual has to display a pervasive sense ofgrandiosity, excessive need for attention, and lack of empathy across a broad array ofsituations. Five of the following nine criteria need to be met:
1. Grandiose sense of self-importance.
2. Preoccupation with fantasies of unlimited success.3. Belief that he or she is special and only can be understood by other special, high
status individuals or groups.
4. Need for excessive admiration.5. Sense of entitlement—assumption that others should accommodate to the per-
son’s needs and desires.
6. Interpersonally exploitative.

What is the Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI)?
The Narcissistic Personality Inventory is a self-report questionnaire that assesses a
person’s narcissistic personality traits based on criteria from an earlier version of theDSM. Published by Raskin and Hall in 1979, it has become a widely used test of narcis-sistic traits. In 1984, Robert Emmons divided the total NPI score into four distinctdimensions: leadership/authority, superiority/arrogance, self-absorption/self-admira-tion, and exploitativeness/entitlement. Emmons found that the first three subscaleswere correlated with adaptive personality traits, such as self-confidence, extraversion,initiative, and ambition, while the fourth subscale was correlated with measures ofpsychopathology. This study suggests that narcissistic traits can have both positiveand negative implications.
Do politicians score higher on the NPI than people in other professions?
In one of the few studies to empirically investigate narcissistic traits in politicians,Robert Hill and Gregory Yousey administered the NPI to 123 university faculty, forty-two politicians (state legislators from four states), ninety-nine clergy (both protestantministers and Catholic priests), and 195 librarians. Their 1998 study found a statisti-cally significant difference in total scores, with politicians scoring higher than theother three professional groups. In terms of the four subscales, politicians scored thehighest on the leadership/authority subscale, and clergy scored the lowest on theexploitativeness/entitlement subscale.
In other words, politicians did score higher than the other three groups in total
narcissism, but the differences seemed mainly due to their high scores on the leader-ship/authority scores. Interestingly, although the differences did not reach statisticalsignificance, politicians also had the highest scores on superiority/arrogance andexploitativeness/entitlement subscales and professors had the highest scores on self-absorption/self-admiration. Without statistical significance, however, these last differ-ences could be due to chance.
Does narcissism create the politician or does politics create the narcissist?
This is an important question. While there is little to no research investigating thisquestion, most clinicians believe that the personality and the job interact with eachother. The traits necessary for success in politics have to be there from the beginning.It takes considerable self-confidence, extraversion, and ambition to wage a successfulpolitical campaign. But the experience of political power also has very potent psycho-
334Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 334logical effects. The power and public attention can be intoxicating, leading people to
feel they are entitled to special treatment and should not be held back by any limits.
This dynamic can also hold true for celebrities. Clinicians have further comment-
ed that the need for a managed and massaged public image can make politicians feelunaccountable for their private behavior. Their public persona becomes entirely cutoff from their authentic private selves. All that matters is the image, not the actualbeliefs or behavior. In fact, the psychiatrist Robert Millman has coined the termacquired situational narcissism , referring to the explosive impact of fame, power, and
celebrity on narcissistic tendencies.
Why do so many politicians get trapped in scandals?
It seems almost every other week we hear of some new political scandal. Politiciansget in trouble for financial shenanigans, abuse of power, and sexual indiscretions. Overand over again, we wonder how such politically astute people can act so recklessly.Don’t they realize they are bound to get caught? As discussed above, politicians mayhave a higher level of narcissistic traits than is found in the general population andthese traits are only strengthened in the seductive spotlight of elected office. Theperks of power can create a semidelusional sense of entitlement and invincibility. Inaddition, when it comes to sexual scandals in particular, the theory of evolution mayhave something to add.
335GROUP DYNAMICS AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE
What did former preidential candidate John Edwards
say about his own narcissistic attitudes?
After the 2008 presidential election, John Edwards, a serious contender in theDemocratic presidential primaries, was revealed to have had an extra-mari-
tal affair. In a television interview on ABC News, Edwards attributed his behaviorto narcissistic attitudes that had mushroomed during his very high-profile cam-paign. “In 2006, I made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in away that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs. I recognized my mis-take and I told my wife that I had a liaison with another woman, and I asked forher forgiveness.… In the course of several campaigns, I started to believe that Iwas special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic.” He stated thathis experiences on the campaign trail “fed a self-focus, an egotism, a narcissismthat leads you to believe you can do whatever you want. You’re invincible. Andthere will be no consequences.”

who have been caught in sex scandals?
The list of politicians caught in sex
scandals is remarkably long and
thoroughly bipartisan in nature.While many other countries expectextra-marital dalliances from theirpoliticians, American political cul-ture is still highly punitive of politi-cians whose behavior strays frommonogamous family values, despitethe frequency of such behavioramong politicians. Gary Hart was aDemocratic candidate for the 1988presidential primary when a sexscandal caught up with him. ElliottSpitzer was the Democratic Gover-nor of New York, brought down by asex scandal in 2008. RepublicanJohn Tower was denied senate confirmation for a cabinet post in 1989 after reve-lation of an extra-marital affair. Mark Foley, a Republican congressman fromFlorida, resigned in 2006 after the exposure of inappropriate contact with ado-lescent congressional pages.
New York’s Governor Eliot Spitzer resigned in 2008 after a

336According to the theory of sexual selection , men gain an evolutionary advantage
from pursuing multiple mates. In many species, males pursue social dominance in
order to gain access to a harem of females. In short, these alpha males maximize theirevolutionary fitness by seeking out youth, variety, and quantity in their sexualencounters. While such behavior among humans is certainly not universal, neither isit unprecedented, or even that unusual. Thus, there may be inherent contradictionsbetween the personality traits of people who succeed in the competitive and aggressivearena of electoral politics, and the public façade of pious self-control that many politi-cians feel compelled to adopt.
Are celebrities narcissistic in the same way that politicians are?
In a 2006 study, Mark Young and Drew Pinsky administered the Narcissistic Personali-ty Inventory (NPI) to 200 celebrities. They found that celebrities scored significantlyhigher on the NPI than both the general population and a comparison group of MBAHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 336GROUP DYNAMICS AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE
337students. They also found that female celebrities scored significantly higher than male
celebrities, which is the opposite pattern found in the general population. Further,reality television celebrities produced the highest NPI scores, followed by comedians,actors, and musicians. Interestingly, they found no correlation between NPI scoresand years of experience in the entertainment industry. This suggests that the celebri-ties’ narcissistic tendencies may have predated their entrance into the industry.
What do we know about celebrity worship?
One area that has received some attention in the research literature is that of celebrityworship. Several studies have looked at it from an absorption-addiction model, sug-gesting that extreme forms of celebrity worship may reflect a kind of addiction. Otherresearch has found that mild forms of celebrity worship are quite common and unre-lated to psychopathology, while more extreme forms do seem correlated with emo-tional disturbance.
In a 2003 study, John Maltby, James Houran, and Lynn McCutcheon administered
the Celebrity Attitudes scale and a personality measure known as the Revised EysenckPersonality Questionnaire to 219 students and 390 community residents. They foundmodest but statistically significant associations between different kinds of celebrityworship and different personality traits. People who engaged in celebrity worship forsocial and entertainment purposes were more likely to score high on extraversion, anadaptive personality trait. People who had an intense and personal investment incelebrity worship scored high on neuroticism, which reflects an anxious and depres-sive emotional reactivity. Finally, people who scored high on the borderline pathologi-cal form of celebrity worship, the most disturbed form, scored high on psychoticism.In Eysenck’s scale, psychoticism is less about psychosis than about aggression, psy-chopathy, and social alienation.
VOTING BEHAVIOR
Why do people vote ?
Because voter turnout is essential to a democracy, psychologists have joined withpolitical scientists to study the factors that motivate people to vote. If you look at itfrom a classic rationalist view of costs and benefits, you can argue that it doesn’t makemuch sense to vote. Voting takes time, energy, and even money if you have to miss aday of work to get to the polling place. And any single person is unlikely to feel thathis or her vote will change the outcome of an election. Nonetheless, people do voteand their participation in electoral politics remains critical for the survival of thedemocratic system. Psychologists and their colleagues in other fields have consideredHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 337the possible motivations for voting. Among other factors, they have suggested the role
of habit, social pressure, altruism, and even genetics.
Do people vote out of habit?
Research into voting records shows that some people vote regularly in every election,while some others seem to target their votes to “issue elections”, where there areissues at stake that the voter cares about. Regular voters, or “habitual voters,” aremore likely to have lived in the same house over several election cycles, according toWendy Wood, John Aldrich, and Jacob Montgomery.
Does social pressure cause people to vote?
Researchers have also looked at the impact of social pressure on voting behavior. Notsurprisingly, fear of public exposure can motivate people to get to the polling place. Apolitical scientist named Donald Green mailed out letters to about 90,000 Michiganhouseholds before the 2006 primary election. An additional 90,000 householdsreceived no letters. Four different letters were sent out. One letter simply remindedpeople of their civic duty to vote, the second letter reminded the recipients that votingrecords (whether or not people voted) were publicly available. The third letter includ-ed information on recipients’ previous voting behavior and the fourth letter listed thepast voting behavior of recipients’ neighbors. It also stated that the recipients’ ownvoter turnout would be reported in another letter sent out to their community. Recip-ients of the fourth letter showed the greatest increase in voter turnout (8.1 percent),followed by recipients of the third letter (4.9 percent), and the second letter (2.5 per-cent). Recipients who were simply reminded of their civic duty to vote only increasedtheir turnout by 1.9 percent.
Does genetics play a role in voting behavior?
James Fowler and Laura Baker have conducted a series of studies on voting behaviorin families. They found that the party affiliation of adopted children tended to be simi-lar to that of their adopted parents and siblings, suggesting that party affiliation wasculturally transmitted. When the authors compared the voting behavior of a largesample of identical and fraternal twins, they found that identical twins were more sim-ilar than fraternal twins in regard to whether or not they voted, but no more similarin their choice of candidate. In sum, this work suggests that voter turnout is related togenetics, while party affiliation is related to environment.
What role does altruism play in voting behavior?
Other researchers have suggested that altruism plays a role in voter turnout. In anexperimental manipulation called “the dictator game,” subjects are given money and
338Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 338told to share it with another person who
will not know their name. In a 2007 studyby James Fowler and Cindy Kam, peoplewho shared their money were significant-ly more likely to vote than those who didnot. Moreover, Richard Jankowski foundthat people who agreed with altruisticstatements were more likely to havevoted in the 1994 elections. Perhapsaltruism is related to a sense of socialcommitment, specifically to a sense ofconnection to the social group and a feel-ing of responsibility for its well-being.Additionally, we can speculate that altru-ism may have some genetic component,perhaps accounting for the apparentgenetic influence on voter turnout.
How do people make decisions on
how to vote ?
Candidates are very interested in the psy-chology behind candidate selection. Theclassic rational tradition would hold thatpeople determine which candidate bestrepresents their interests or their valuesand then vote accordingly. However, the psychologist Drew Westen has argued thatpeople rely on far more than rational analysis when choosing how to vote. Carefulanalyses of candidates’ qualifications, voting records, and positions on the issues istime consuming and difficult, especially for people who do not follow current events.Therefore people tend to fall back on shortcuts, basing their decisions on personal lik-ing of candidates, identification with candidates, hot button issues, and simple mes-sages that stimulate strong emotional responses. It is important to realize that muchof this emotional information processing can be unconscious. As with many otherkinds of choices, people may think their choices are based on rational analyses, whenthey are actually more emotionally driven.
How do politicians use psychology in their campaigns?
Given the emotional influences on voting behavior, it is hardly surprising that a wholeindustry of political consultants struggles to figure out how to best package candi-dates to appeal to the voting public. In short, many campaigns try to influence voterresponse by shaping voters’ emotional reactions. One powerful way to do this is

Voting behavior is certainly not a purely intellectual activity;
researchers have found that other factors, including socialpressure, feelings of altruism, and even genetics can play arole (iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 339through associative conditioning . Politicians try to create either negative or positive
associations with particular issues or candidates. This can be done through careful use
of language, meticulously designed visual images, and intentional use of emotionallysignificant symbols. For example, the colors of the American flag grace almost everynational campaign and, though it may be a cliché, politicians are frequently pho-tographed holding babies. These images prod the voter to associate the candidate withpatriotism and support of the family.
What does Frank Luntz say about the use of language to influence opinions?
The political consultant Frank Luntz specializes in shaping language to influence pub-lic opinion. Through language he aims to attract the listeners’ attention, implant ideasin their memory, and stimulate either positive or negative emotional responses. In his2007 book, Luntz states that the most effective political rhetoric is characterized byrepetition, consistency, simple plain language, catchy memorable phrases, and shortsentences. The aesthetic quality of the speeches matter too. A politician’s words shouldbe pleasant to listen to with a rhythmic flow. While the message should be consistent,some degree of novelty is also important to capture the listener’s attention. Moreover,visual images can often have more power than words. While Luntz has been criticizedfor promoting style over substance (and in effect, manipulation over communication),he states that content is not entirely irrelevant. The speaker must have credibility; ifthe politician goes too far beyond what is believable, the audience will be turned off.
How can language affect public perceptions of political rhetoric?
In Frank Luntz’s view, a single word can frame an issue, creating either a positive ornegative association in a voter’s mind. In a 2005 memo to Republican party membersthat was widely disseminated in the media, Luntz listed 14 phrases that should neverbe said. Included below are seven examples from his list. In support of the power oflanguage, Luntz stated that two-thirds of Americans wanted to “personalize” SocialSecurity, while only one-third wanted to “privatize” it.

Can psychology contribute to ballot design?
Given its historical interest in perception, cognition, and motor function, there is
much that psychology can contribute to the study of ballot design. There are two mainproblems to consider when designing ballots. For one, ballots should be functional.People should be able to use them with ease. This issue is of particular relevance forelderly voters, who may suffer from cognitive, perceptual, or physical difficulties. In a2007 study by Tiffany Jastrzembski and Neil Charness, elderly voters were shown elec-tronic voting machines that differed in two ways. Votes were entered via touch screenor key pad, and races were presented either one at a time or all at once. This resultedin four different combinations of ballot design. Elderly voters performed best on thecombination of touch screen ballots with races presented one at a time. Additionally,ballot design should not favor one candidate over the other. For example, in a 1998study by Joanne Miller and John Krosnick, name order was found to significantlyaffect voter choice in forty-eight percent of 118 races in the 1992 Ohio state elections.On average, the candidate on the top of the list received 2.5 percent more votes thanthe candidates listed further down the ballot. While that may not seem like a largemargin, it is enough to win an election.

MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESS
343DEFINITIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS
How do we define mental illness?
Some concept of mental illness exists in perhaps every culture on earth and descrip-
tions of it are found in ancient texts dating back to the Greeks and Romans. Thosewho have confronted mental illness in themselves or someone close to them canappreciate the extreme pain and dysfunction it can cause. Nonetheless, it is difficultto come up with a precise definition of mental illness. In the most recent version ofthe Diagnostic and Statistic Manual (DSM), a mental disorder is defined as a psycho-logical pattern that causes distress or dysfunction and that is beyond the norms ofthe individual’s culture.
What is the relationship between abnormal behavior and mental illness?
This is a difficult question. Even though a mental illness must cause distress or dys-function, to some extent we judge the pathology of behavior by its relationship to cul-tural norms. Therefore our concept of mental illness is tied in part to our ideas of whatis normal. This raises the question of whether all abnormal behavior is pathologicaland whether all normal behavior is mentally healthy. Clearly, people can engage inunusual behavior that is not pathological. We do not want to diagnose any kind oforiginal or unconventional behavior as mentally ill. Nor is all normal behavior healthy.Drug abuse, violence, and anorexia can be very common in certain social groups, butall cause distress or dysfunction. Thus, although it can be very easy to recognize men-tal illness in the most extreme cases (such as acute psychosis or severe depression),there are many circumstances where the boundaries between mental health and men-tal illness are not so clear.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 343Who are the Lizard People?
Delusions are generally diagnosed
as a symptom of a psychotic dis-
order. A delusion is defined as a fixed,false belief that is considered abnor-mal within the person’s culture.Nonetheless, it is not always easy toseparate a delusion from a belief thathas become acceptable within a cer-tain subculture. This can be the caseeven with very bizarre beliefs.
For example, the author David
Icke has very successfully promotedthe idea that the world is run by aconspiracy known as the Illuminati(a term dating back to earlier con-spiracy theories). The Illuminatidescend from an alien race of lizardpeople who came to Earth fromanother planet and are capable of changing shape and assuming human form.Most of the major political and economic figures in the world today, includingGeorge W. Bush, Hillary Clinton, and even the late Princess Diana, are actuallyconsidered to be lizard people. There are several different branches of the lizardpeople, including the Grays, the Adopted Grays, the Crinklies, the Tall Blonds,the Tall Robots, and the Annunaki. George W. Bush is reportedly a member ofthe Annunaki branch of the lizard people.
Are these beliefs delusional? Most of us would consider these ideas to be false
beliefs that are culturally abnormal. Nonetheless, David Icke has many followersand his books have sold very well. Within a certain subculture, therefore, thesebeliefs are not considered abnormal. Situations such as this illustrate how difficultit can be at times to determine what is and is not a symptom of mental illness.
According to one conspiracy theory, prominent politicians and
other leaders in the world are actually alien lizard peoplecalled the Illuminati ( iStock).
344Why do we classify mental illness?
All diagnostic systems depend upon classification. What function does classification
serve? Imagine if we had no common, standardized classification system for mentalillness. With no common language to describe clinical observations, there could beno coordination among clinicians, researchers, or people working in public policy.There would be no way to research the prevalence, etiology (cause), outcome, or pro-gression of the illness. Without a grounding of scientific data, there would be no wayHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 344ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY: MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESS
345to systematically develop and test treatments. Treatments would be fragmented, ad
hoc and untested, ultimately based on personal opinion instead of scientific fact.
How do we classify mental illness?
Mental illnesses or disorders are classified according to the nature of their symptoms,their causes and their course. The course of an illness refers to its progression over
time. DSM-IV-TR has sixteen general categories with multiple diagnoses in each cate-gory. Examples of these categories include eating disorders, psychotic disorders,impulse control disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and mental disordersdue to a general medical condition.
What is the DSM-IV?
DSM refers to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual . DSM-IV is the fourth edition of
the DSM, published in 1994. DSM-IV Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) was published in2000. This edition made minimal changes to the diagnoses, but updated the literaturereview in the manual. The DSM system provides a standardized method to diagnosemental illness. It is developed in coordination with the International Classification ofDiseases (ICD) which is published by the World Health Organization (WHO). Diag-noses are provided on five axes, the first axis (axis I) lists specific clinical syndromes,such as schizophrenia or major depression. The second axis (axis II) lists personalitydisorders and mental retardation, chronic conditions that affect the full range of aperson’s psychological functioning. Axis III pertains to medical conditions that mightaffect the person’s psychological state, axis IV to psychosocial and environmentalstressors, and axis V to the person’s general level of adaptive functioning (the GAFscore), which ranges from one to one hundred.
What is the history of the DSM system?
Interestingly, the first official psychiatric classification system was developed to helpwith the U.S. Census. The Census Bureau aimed for an accurate estimation of the U.S.population, including residents of mental hospitals. In 1840, the U.S. Census had onlyone category for mental illness, idiocy/insanity. By 1880, there were seven categories:mania, melancholia, monomania, paresis, dementia, dipsomania, and epilepsy. In1917, the official psychiatric professional associations decided it was time to designtheir own classification system, taking the diagnosis of mental illness out of the handsof the government.
What would soon become the American Psychiatric Association (APA) joined with
the National Commission on Mental Hygiene to develop a nomenclature (system oflabels) for mental disorders. This system applied mainly to the most severely ill inpa-tients, those living in mental hospitals. After World War II brought back veterans suf-fering from the psychological aftereffects of war, the diagnostic systems were expand-Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 345ed to consider the needs of outpatients, those living in the community. The first edi-
tion of the DSM was published in 1952, DSM-III came in 1980, DSM-III-R in 1987, andDSM-IV in 1994. The projected publication date of DSM-V is 2013.
Do psychiatric classifications change over time?
Because human psychology and culture are so complex and so variable, it is very hardto come up with a foolproof system for diagnosing mental illness. The first editions ofthe DSM were strongly influenced by prevailing psychological theories and were poor-ly linked to empirical research. Some of the diagnoses were controversial and what wewould now consider culturally biased. For example, homosexuality was listed as amental disorder until 1974. While more recent versions of the DSM have made muchgreater use of empirical research, there are still critics who suggest the diagnoses lackadequate scientific validity. Because of the inevitable flaws in any classificationscheme, however, it is assumed that each version of the DSM will eventually becomeoutdated and will need to be replaced by a newer edition.
What are the drawbacks to classification systems?
It is critical to recognize that no matter how complex and sophisticated the classifica-tion system becomes, it can only provide guidelines for treatment. Diagnoses are pro-totypes—they are only ideals—and few patients fit the classification perfectly. In fact,many patients do not quite fit into any diagnostic category. Moreover, it is also criticalto remember that the classification system applies to a pattern of symptoms. It doesnot and can never describe the whole person. For this reason DSM-IV-TR only refersto “individuals with schizophrenia,” for example, and not “schizophrenics.”
What changes will be made in DSM-V?
DSM-V is scheduled to come out in 2013. However, in early 2010, the American Psy-chiatric Association published their proposed revisions in order to solicit commentsfrom readers on these changes. Along with changes to the criteria and classification ofspecific diagnoses, some very general changes were also proposed. For one, the firstthree axes of the five-axis diagnostic system will be collapsed into one axis. In DSM-IV,axis I is for clinical syndromes, axis II for personality disorders and mental retarda-tion, and axis III for medical disorders that might be relevant to the mental condition.In DSM-V, that will all be coded on one line. Also DSM-V puts much more emphasis ondimensional ratings than any previous DSM edition. In other words clinicians will ratepatients in terms of the severity of various clinical traits (such as depression, anxiety,
etc), and not just categorize them as either having or not having a particular disorder.
Diagnostic categories will be retained in DSM-V, but there will be more room fordimensional ratings. Because the DSM-V system has yet to be finalized, we will focushere on the diagnostic system of DSM-IV and DSM-IV-TR.
346Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 346What role does culture play in mental illness?
While most of the DSM diagnoses can be found across cultures, people from different
cultures do vary in the way that they express psychological distress. In many cultures,depression is less likely to involve conscious feelings of sadness and more likely toinvolve preoccupation with bodily ailments. Likewise, the content of schizophrenicdelusions and hallucinations is strongly influenced by cultural themes. Delusions ofbeing the messiah are frequently found in Jerusalem, while delusions of being trackedby the CIA are more likely to be found in the United States. In addition, some cultureshave developed unique forms of expressing emotional distress. DSM-IV-TR includes asection on culture-bound syndromes, which refer to distinct syndromes that are
347ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY: MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESS
What are some examples of culture-bound syndromes?
DSM-IV-TR includes a section on culture-bound syndromes, which are dis-tinct patterns of emotional or behavioral disturbances that are found only in
specific cultures.
 Ataque de Nervios: This is commonly found among Latin Americans, par-
ticularly those from the Caribbean. Ataques serve as a means of expressingintense emotional distress often following a disturbing event. Symptomsinclude uncontrollable shouting or crying, trance, aggressive verbal orphysical behavior, trembling, or fainting. While ataques may be misdiag-nosed as a psychotic episode, they are probably more akin to a panic attackor a conversion disorder, which involves the expression of emotional dis-tress through physical symptoms.
 Bouffee delirante: This syndrome is found in West Africa and in Haiti. It
involves a sudden outburst of agitation and excitement, in which the per-son is confused, disoriented, and may complain of visual or auditory hallu-cinations (seeing or hearing things that are not there). This may be mostsimilar to the DSM IV diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder.
 Koro: Fear of a Retracting Penis: This rather bizarre syndrome is found in
South and East Asia, including China, Thailand, and India. The word koro
is believed to be of Malaysian origin, but the syndrome has several differ-ent names across the region, including shook yang, shook yong, and suo
yang in China, and jinjinia bemar in India. The syndrome is characterized
by acute anxiety that the person’s genitals (including breasts in a woman)will retract into the body and even cause death. A somewhat similar fear ofpenis theft is found in parts of Africa. Although in the United States such asyndrome would be seen as a bizarre delusion, koro would be more accu-rately diagnosed as a conversion disorder.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 347found only in specific cultures. Importantly, they are recognized as illnesses or as dis-
turbed behavior within their host culture. Most of these syndromes indicate that theindividual is overwhelmed by strong negative emotions. Examples include: Attaque denervios from Latin American cultures, Koro from Chinese and East Asian cultures,and ghost sickness from Native American peoples.
MAJOR MENTAL ILLNESSES
What is schizophrenia?
Schizophrenia is perhaps the most disabling of the major mental illnesses. Althoughdescriptions of similar clinical presentations date back to the earliest periods of writ-ten history, the term “schizophrenia” and the current definition of the disorder arerelatively recent. The German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin (1856–1926) first distin-guished between manic depressive illness and dementia praecox, or what was latercalled schizophrenia. The Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler (1857–1939) coined theactual term “schizophrenia” from the Greek words for “split mind.” According toDSM-IV, schizophrenia is characterized by two or more of the following symptoms:delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, disorganized or catatonic behavior,and negative symptoms. These symptoms must have been present for at least one

Some people think that schizophrenia means having multiple personalities, which is actually known as Dissociative Identity Diso rder.
Schizophrenia involves psychiatric symptoms like delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized behavior.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 348month, and result in significant social or occupational impairment and/or reduction
in self-care. Some sign of the disorder must have been present for at least six months,and the symptoms cannot be due to another condition (such as substance-inducedpsychosis or a medical condition).
How are the symptoms of schizophrenia defined?
The DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia describes a range of psychotic symptoms. Psy-
chosis refers to a significant break with reality testing , or the ability to recognize real-
ity as other people who are in similar circumstances typically see it. There are a num-ber of different types of psychotic symptoms:
 Delusions refer to a fixed, false belief that is considered abnormal within the
person’s culture.
 Bizarre delusions are physically impossible, as in the belief that the queen of
England is on the planet Mars sending messages to a chip in your brain. A non-
bizarre delusion is physically possible, such as the false belief that a celebrity is
in love with you or that you are being bugged by the FBI.
 Hallucinations refer to a perceptual experience of something that is not really
there. Hallucinations can be auditory (sense of sound), visual (sense of sight),olfactory (sense of smell), or tactile (sense of touch). Auditory hallucinations arethe most common, and often involve one or more voices talking.
 Disorganized speech and behavior generally reflect disorganized thought, a
breakdown of the coherent, logical flow of thought.
All the symptoms mentioned so far refer to positive symptoms or problematic
traits that are present. In contrast, negative symptoms reflect the absence of healthy
traits. Specifically, negative symptoms refer to blunted or flat affect (or emotion) and adulling of motivation, initiative, energy, and cognitive activity.
What is thought disorder?
Thought disorder is one of the most striking and debilitating aspects of severe psy-chosis. This refers to the way that thought is organized. Thought disorder does not
pertain to the content of the thought process, to what the person is thinking about,but to the way that the ideas are put together. Does the person display a logical andorderly flow of ideas? Or are the ideas jumbled, only loosely related to each other andultimately impossible to understand?
There are many kinds of thought disorder:
 Paucity of ideation refers to the lack of adequate thought content. The person’s
mind is more or less blank.
349ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY: MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESSHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 349 Overproduction of thought is the opposite condition, where ideas are tumbling
out of the person’s mind.
Other terms refer specifically to the organization of the person’s thought and range in
severity from mild and fairly normal to entirely incomprehensible.
 Digressive thought describes a state where the person drifts from topic to topic,
but the speech is still understandable.
 Circumstantial thought is roundabout but eventually gets to the point. If you
ask a circumstantial patient a question, he or she will go a long way around thepoint, but eventually answer the question.
 Tangential thought is more severe. With effort, you can understand the person,
but it takes considerable concentration to identify the connections between thedifferent ideas.
 Flight of Ideas is similar to tangential thought, but is also characterized by a
highly energized overproduction of thought.
 Looseness of association is not intelligible. Fragments of ideas may be recogniz-
able, but the person can lapse into a loose stream of thoughts in which separateideas bear little relationship to one another.
 Word salad is essentially gibberish, with no clear relationship between the
words in the sentence.
While thought disorder can be present in many psychiatric illnesses, severe
thought disorder is most characteristic of schizophrenia.
Is split personality the same as schizophrenia?
The popular understanding of psychiatric terminology is often quite different from thetechnical meaning of the terms. The term “split personality” is is often confused withschizophrenia. Split personality more accurately refers to dissociative identity disorder(DID), formerly known as multiple personality disorder. While schizophrenia is a diag-nosis of psychotic symptoms, DID is classified under the category of dissociative disor-ders. DID generally develops in childhood as a means of coping with extreme traumaticexperiences, such as ongoing sexual or physical abuse. People manage the overwhelm-ing emotions occasioned by the trauma by splitting their conscious experience into mul-tiple identities. There may be the cute little girl, the responsible young man, and therebellious teenager. Outside of their sense of their own identities, however, people withDID are not typically psychotic. In contrast, people with schizophrenia generally have aconsistent sense of their own identity, but have ongoing struggles with psychosis.

nized behavior. Unfortunately, we have fewer tools to treat the negative symptoms.The severity of the illness will vary from individual to individual, however, and somepeople respond better to treatment than others. Many people with schizophrenia canlive in the community, enjoy social relationships, and even perform volunteer or part-time work. The vast majority of people with schizophrenia will need to take psychi-atric medication indefinitely, however, to control psychotic symptoms and remain asfunctional as possible.
Is all psychosis schizophrenia?
People can suffer from psychosis without meeting criteria for schizophrenia. Certainmedical illnesses and drugs can cause psychotic symptoms. In fact it can be quite diffi-cult to tease apart the relative contributions of mental illness and drug abuse when asubstance user has psychotic symptoms. People with mood disorders, such as majordepressive disorder or bipolar disorder, can often present with psychotic symptoms. Inaddition, people under severe stress can sometimes experience psychotic symptoms.The diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder is characterized by quick, transient psychoticsymptoms, after which the person returns to normal, generally without need for fur-ther medication.
What is bipolar disorder?
Bipolar disorder used to be known as manic depression. It is classified as a mood dis-order and is characterized by at least one manic episode and typically one or moremajor depressive episodes. A manic episode refers to a period of at least one weekwhere the person exhibits elevated, euphoric, or irritable mood. The person also dis-plays symptoms of increased activity, with much higher levels of energy, initiative, andimpulsivity than normal.
More specifically, three or more of the following symptoms must be present (or
four if the mood is only irritable): inflated self-esteem or grandiosity; a decreased needfor sleep; an increase in amount of talking or pressure to keep talking; flight of ideas orracing thoughts; distractibility; an increase in goal-directed activity; and an increase inrisky, pleasurable behavior. People in manic episodes frequently engage in reckless andexcessive spending, sexual activity, or substance abuse. They can also have psychoticsymptoms during manic episodes, but the symptoms tend to be mood-congruent (con-sistent with their elevated, expansive mood). For example, they may have grandiosedelusions that they are going to Washington, D.C., to run the State Department. Peoplewith bipolar disorder tend to have a higher baseline than people with schizophrenia.Many people are completely symptom-free when not in the middle of an episode andcan live entirely normal lives. However, even people who are symptom-free at baselinewill need to take medication to maintain their mental health.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 352What was the mental ailment that tormented
the painter Vincent van Gogh?
Vincent van Gogh (1853–1890)
was a Dutch-born painter who is
now considered one of the greatestartists of the nineteenth century.Little known in his own day, hiswork currently sells for millions ofdollars. Van Gogh suffered from ago-nizing bouts of mental illness duringwhich he repeatedly tried to killhimself. He eventually succeeded in1890 at the age of 37. According toall reports, when he was not in thethroes of a psychotic episode, he wascalm, cooperative and completelyfocused on his painting.
Over the intervening century,
many people have theorized aboutthe nature of the mental illness thateventually killed him. While we cannever be fully confident of any diag-nosis made in the absence of theactual patient, van Gogh left a trea-sure trove of letters, mainly writtento or by his devoted brother, Theo.From these letters, we can identifyseveral major depressive episodeswith psychotic features.
However, the psychiatrist Dietrich Blumer noted in a 2002 article that van
Gogh also wrote of periods of excitement, increased energy, and excessive reli-gious zeal. Although such symptoms might suggest manic episodes, Blumerconcluded that van Gogh suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy, greatly exacer-bated by his intake of absinthe, a popular but highly alcoholic beverage. It is alsopossible that he suffered from both illnesses: epilepsy and bipolar disorder. Tragi-cally, his sister also suffered from mental illness (possibly schizophrenia) andwas eventually confined to an asylum.
It is well known that the nineteenth century artist Vincent van
Gogh suffered from mental illness. The exact nature of hissuffering is still a matter of some debate ( iStock).ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY: MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESS
353Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 353What is depression?
Unlike mania, depression is something many people experience at some point in their
life. Therefore the term depression covers a very wide range of experiences. At themost mild end of the spectrum are transient feelings of sadness. Longer periods ofsadness following losses or other upsetting events also fall within the normal range ofhuman experience. When feelings of sadness become the constant backdrop of a per-son’s mood, we are moving into depression.
While feelings of depression following difficult life experiences are still very com-
mon, severe depression is markedly different from these milder and more transienttypes of depression. DSM-IV refers to the most severe form of depression as a major
depressive episode. To meet criteria for a major depressive episode, the individual hasto exhibit at least five of the following symptoms over a two-week period and thesymptoms have to represent a change from the person’s previous state. These symp-toms include: consistently depressed mood, diminished interest in activities, signifi-cant weight gain or loss (not due to dieting), increase or decrease in sleep (insomniaor hypersomnia), physical restlessness or slowing down (psychomotor agitation orretardation), loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness and guilt, and thoughts of deathor suicide. When someone has one or more of these episodes, they are diagnosed withmajor depressive disorder—presuming the episodes cannot be attributed to anothermental disorder such as bipolar disorder or a substance-induced depression.
What is the relationship between mental illness and creativity?
It has been frequently noted that creative people seem to have a disproportionate rateof mental illness. Studies have since borne this out, particularly among writers. Mooddisorders may be the most common form of mental disorder among writers, who havean elevated rate of both depression and bipolar disorder. Consequently, there is a dis-proportionately higher rate of suicide in these artists. For example, the novelistsErnest Hemingway and Virginia Woolf both committed suicide, as did the poets AnneSexton and Sylvia Plath. It is not clear why creativity and mood disorders are linked toeach other, although researchers have speculated that the intense emotionality of amood disorder heightens the sensitivity of creative people. Additionally, people withbipolar disorder can be extremely productive and creative when in a hypomanic state.Hypomania is a milder form of mania, when the elevation of mood and the increase in
energy and self-confidence have not yet led to functional impairment.
What is obsessive-compulsive disorder?
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is classified under anxiety disorders. OCD ischaracterized by obsessions that are repetitive, senseless, and intrusive thoughts thatgenerally increase anxiety, and/or compulsions that are repetitive, senseless behaviorsthat often serve to reduce the anxiety caused by the obsession. Common obsessions
354Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 354include an unrealistic and excessive fear of danger, of contamination, or of commit-
ting hurtful or morally unacceptable actions. Common compulsions include repetitivecleaning, checking, ordering, arranging, and hoarding behaviors.
Although these symptoms can become debilitating—truly taking over a person’s
life—an individual with OCD always retains some degree of insight into the pathologyof their behavior. This differentiates OCD from a delusion, in which the person is con-vinced of the truth of his or her belief. In a mild case of OCD, a person may need toperform a specific routine when turning off the computer at work every evening, per-haps taking fifteen minutes more than necessary to complete the task. In an extremecase of OCD, someone can take nine hours to finish a shower, washing each body partmultiple times in ritualized ways.
What is autism?
Autism is a disorder first diagnosed in childhood and is included in the category ofpervasive developmental disorders. Autism is categorized by deficits or abnormalbehavior in three areas: social interaction, communication, and range of interests.Autistic children show avoidance of eye contact and of social interaction in general.They do not develop normal peer relationships and they do not show typical desire toshare toys or engage in social play. Their communication skills are also abnormal,with delayed language development, improper use of personal pronouns and stereo-typed, or repetitive use of language (“Your parents is coming! Your parents is com-ing!”). Finally, they show a restricted range of interests, with intense and obsessivefocus on particular objects or topics. For example, a person with autism can developan obsessive interest in trains and memorize the entire schedule of a given transit sys-tem. Additionally, there is a rigid adherence to routine and marked distress when theroutine is violated. Some of these symptoms relate to another characteristic, one thatis well researched but not yet captured in the DSM system.
People with autism frequently suffer from a deficit in theory of mind. This refers
to the ability to understand another person’s subjective experience and is a necessaryfirst step in empathy. Because of their impaired theory of mind, people with autismcan have a very difficult time making sense of social interaction and often find socialsituations extremely stressful.
How is Asperger’s syndrome different from autism?
In recent years there has been increasing interest in the diagnosis of Asperger’s syn-drome. It is not clear whether Asperger’s syndrome is simply a milder form of autism,or whether it is a truly separate syndrome. As with autism, Asperger’s syndrome ischaracterized by deficits in social interaction and a restricted range of interests evi-dent from early childhood. However, there is no delay in language development andverbal skills are generally higher in Asperger’s than in autism. Additionally, there is
355ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY: MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESSHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 355usually no evidence of cognitive delay in Asperger’s, whereas mental retardation is
fairly common in autism. People with relatively mild forms of Asperger’s can be verysuccessful, generally in fields that focus on logical analysis, factual information, ormanipulation of objects (for example, computer programming, engineering, or math-ematics), but they may still have difficulty negotiating social situations.
What are the causes of mental illness?
The causes of mental illness are complex and it is not possible to point to one singlecause. However, we are aware of many factors that contribute to mental illness; suchcontributors are known as risk factors. We do know that many forms of mental illnesshave a genetic component to them and specific genes related to the production of neu-
rotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine have been associated with several
forms of mental illness. We also know that early childhood environment plays animportant role; stable, loving environments protect against mental illness and chaot-ic, neglectful, and traumatic environments raise the risk of it. We also know that highlevels of stress in both childhood and adulthood contribute to mental illness.
356Why are there more people with autism in Silicon Valley?
According to a 2001 article in Wired magazine by Steve Silberman, there has
been a significant increase in autism diagnoses nationwide. It is unclear
how much this is due to better diagnoses or actual changes in the incidence ofthe disorder, possibly caused by environmental toxins. In a 2002 report to theCalifornia legislature, the M.I.N.D. Institute referenced a 273 percent increase inautism diagnoses in California from 1987 to 1998, which they suggest was notdue to changes in diagnostic practices. Moreover, Silberman reported an evenlarger spike in autism and Asperger’s diagnoses in Silicon Valley, as well as othertechnology-heavy areas.
One explanation for this involves the concept of assortative mating, first pro-
posed by the psychologist Simon Baron-Cohen. People with Asperger’s or autismtraits (otherwise known as autistic spectrum traits) are known to be talented inthe kind of logical and analytic thinking integral to computer science. Likewise, anelevated rate of autistic spectrum disorders has been found among the relatives ofprofessionals or students in physics, mathematics, and engineering. Consequently,the huge expansion of the technology industry in the 1980s set the stage for muchlarger concentrations of people with autistic spectrum features than had existedpreviously. In this way, men and women with similar genes could come together,marry, and have children. Such parents passed their combined genes onto the nextgeneration, increasing the concentration of autism spectrum genes.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 356Particular disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder and acute stress disor-
der, are specifically linked to extremely stressful events. We also know that the physi-
cal environment plays a role in mental health and mental illness. Environmental tox-ins, substances of abuse, and even exposure to substances of abuse in utero can allcontribute to the development of mental illness.
So what’s the verdict when it comes to mental health: nature or nurture?
The mental health field has gone through wide pendulum swings with regard to thenature/nurture debate. In middle of the twentieth century, there was an excessiveemphasis on environmental causes. Phrases such as the “schizophrenigenic mother”and the “refrigerator mother” put unnecessary blame on mothers for disorders suchas schizophrenia and autism. Starting in the 1980s, the pendulum swung back towarda biological and genetic approach, in some cases unnecessarily diminishing theimpact of the environment. By the beginning of the twenty-first century, however, anintegrative approach to the nature/nurture debate has developed. Now it is widelyunderstood that all psychological processes involve the interaction between geneticsand environment. Our genetics affect our environment by influencing how we interactwith the environment, which in turn shapes how the world responds to us. Moreover,research has shown that the reverse is also true; the environment affects our genes.More specifically, different environmental conditions (for example degree of maternaltouch) can affect whether specific genes are turned on or off.

358Can any one gene cause mental illness?
As far as we know, the major mental illnesses are not single-gene disorders. Unlike
certain medical and neurological disorders (for example, Huntington’s disease), psy-chiatric disorders cannot be attributed to any one gene. While multiple genes havebeen linked to psychiatric disorders (for example, neureulin–1, catechol O-methyl-transferase, and dysbindin genes for schizophrenia), these genes are best understoodas risk factors for the disease rather than as definite causes. Not all people with thegene will have the disorder and not all people with the disorder will have the gene.Therefore, geneticists now believe that most psychiatric disorders are related to aHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 358ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY: MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESS
359whole series of genes, only some of which are currently known. Any one of these vul-
nerability genes raises the risk of the disorder, but not by a large amount. The greaterthe number of vulnerability genes that any given person has, the greater the risk ofdeveloping the disorder.
Are some psychiatric disorders more genetically based than others?
Different psychiatric disorders vary as to the relative importance of genetics or environ-ment. The most severe mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism,and obsessive compulsive disorder, are seen to have a strong genetic component withenvironment playing a largely supportive role. Disorders such as post-traumatic stressdisorder, dissociative disorders, and various personality disorders have a much strongerenvironmental component, with genetics playing a more supportive role.
DISORDERS OF PERSONALITY
What is the difference between axis I disorders and personality disorders?
The syndromes discussed in the preceding section are known as axis I disorders . This
refers to specific patterns of dysfunction in thought, emotions, and behavior. But notall psychopathology fits into an axis I diagnosis. Sometimes the problem is more wide-spread and not just restricted to a specific pattern of behavior. In effect, the problemrelates to the person’s entire personality. While psychologists and other mental healthprofessionals agree that psychopathology can reflect an ingrained problem with per-sonality, there is less consensus on how to understand personality pathology. In fact,the definition of personality per se is not entirely settled.
How do we define personality?
While there are multiple approaches to the study of personality, we can provide a generaldefinition by stating that an individual’s personality involves stable patterns of perceiv-ing and interacting with the environment, including the person’s cognitive, emotional,and behavioral responses. This includes the individual’s self-perception, as well as theirtypical mode of relating to other people. Personality is largely established by late adoles-cence or early adulthood. It is conservative and difficult to change. Nonetheless, person-ality is not entirely fixed and there is possibility for change throughout adulthood.
How do we define personality pathology?
In general personality pathology can be defined as any enduring pattern of personalitythat causes distress or dysfunction and that falls outside the norms of the individual’s cul-Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 359ture. It is possible to divide the large literature on personality pathology into three overall
approaches, categorical, dimensional , and schema. The categorical approach suggests
that different kinds of personality pathology can be classified into specific categories, as isfound in the DSM. The dimensional approach suggests that people vary as to the strengthof various personality traits, and that each individual will have a unique profile of highand low scores on measures of these traits. Perhaps the best known dimensionalapproach is the Five-Factor Model, as described by Paul Costa and Robert McCrae.
The schema approach is somewhat more complex and comes out of both psycho-
analytic theory and cognitive psychotherapy. In this view, our personality is shaped byour expectations of ourselves and other people in relationships. This set of expecta-tions, or schemas, operates largely out of consciousness and guides our thoughts,emotions, and behaviors in meaningful situations.
What causes personality pathology?
Personality pathology has both environmental and genetic causes. The schemaapproach addresses the environmental causes of personality pathology, consideringhow early relationships with parents and other key figures in childhood shape endur-ing personality traits. The psychiatrist Robert Cloninger suggested that personality ismade up of both temperament and character. Temperament refers to biologicallybased personality traits that are determined by genetics. Character refers to the partsof personality that are most influenced by the environment. In this way, he integratedboth genetic and environmental explanations of personality.
What is the schema approach?
The schema approach is used here to refer to any theory that sees personality asderived from a set of expectations of self and others that guides cognitive, emotional,
and behavioral responses in relevant situations. Depending on the theoretical orienta-tion, such expectations might be termed schemas, representations , or internal work-
ing models. Schemas grow out of early childhood experiences and, by adulthood, theyare difficult, but not impossible, to change. For example, if a child’s mother is loving,empathic, and emotionally stable, the child will learn that the world is safe, under-standable, and benevolent. The child will learn to approach the people he or sheencounters in an open and friendly way, which will in turn elicit similarly positiveresponses. Likewise, if the child is raised in a rejecting, hurtful, and neglectful envi-ronment, this will teach the child a suspicious and pessimistic view of the world. Sucha negative outlook will guide the child’s behavior, thus eliciting negative and rejectingresponses from others, further confirming the child’s pessimistic schemas.
This general model of personality pathology has received empirical support from a
huge range of research and has been integral to the development of many types of psy-chotherapy. However, it does not lend itself well to diagnosis and so has had little
360Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 360impact so far on diagnostic schemes. Moreover, it only accounts for the learned
aspects of personality, and not the inborn or biological aspects.
What is the history of the schema approach?
The general concept of schemas grew out of psychoanalytic theory. In the beginningof psychoanalysis, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the focus waslargely on the battles between drives and defenses, between sexual and aggressiveinstincts, and the need to inhibit them. With time, noted psychoanalysts such as OttoRank, Melanie Klein, D.W. Winnicott, Harry Stack Sullivan, and W.R.D. Fairbarnexpanded that rather narrow focus to include their patients’ characteristic ways ofengaging with the world around them. To some degree, all of these pioneering psycho-analysts linked the personality traits of their adult patients to their early childhoodrelationships with parents. This approach later became known as object relations, andincluded an assumption that early childhood relationships impacted adult personalityby etching a particular picture of the world into the patient’s mind.
What is temperament?
One of the controversies that has persisted throughout the history of psychology hasto do with the extent to which personality is learned or inborn. Although there is con-siderable evidence supporting the impact of early childhood relationships on adultpersonality, there is also solid evidence that many personality traits—such as shyness,extraversion, sensation-seeking, and even impulse control—are genetically deter-mined. In the early 1990s, Robert Cloninger proposed that personality reflected thecombination of both temperament and character. He defined temperament as inborn,
genetically transmitted traits that influence the way we process information. He pro-posed three specific traits of temperament: harm avoidance, novelty seeking, and
reward dependence. He later added persistence, which refers to the tendency to perse-vere toward a goal despite setbacks.
Both harm avoidance, which involves the tendency to avoid risk, and novelty seek-
ing, which involves the tendency to seek out stimulation even if it involves risk, havereceived considerable support in the literature and do seem to have a genetic compo-nent. Harm avoidance may be mediated by the neurotransmitter serotonin, while nov-
elty seeking has been associated with both dopamine and norepinephrine.
What is Cloninger’s concept of character?
Cloninger’s concept of character is very similar to the schema approach describedabove. He believed character to involve learned patterns of interacting with the envi-ronment, reflecting concepts of the world that were in large part formed in earlychildhood. Cloninger proposed three character traits: self-directedness, (initiative,
361ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY: MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESSHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 361responsibility, and personal agency); cooperativeness (helpfulness, pro-social orienta-
tion); and self-transcendance (spiritually-inclined, able to rise above self-absorption).His Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) is a self-report questionnaire withseven scales measuring the four temperament and three character dimensions.
What personality traits are genetic?
Cloninger’s distinction between temperament and character suggests that some per-sonality traits are learned while others are inborn. This leads to the question of whichpersonality traits fall into which category. Genetic studies suggest that many genescode for either behavioral activation or inhibition. In other words, many of the genesthat influence personality seem to code for either sensation seeking, impulsive, andextraverted traits, or anxious, harm avoidant, and introverted traits. Psychiatric disor-ders such as alcohol abuse, borderline and antisocial personality disorder, and atten-tion deficit disorder are associated with behavioral activation genes, while other disor-ders or traits such as depression, anxiety, and introversion are associated withbehavioral inhibition genes.
What personality traits are learned?
While personality traits related to behavioral activation or inhibition appear to have astrong genetic influence, traits related to trust, morality, empathy, and capacity forintimacy appear to be more strongly influenced by the environment.
What does Kenneth Kendler’s work tell us about the genetics of personality?
The psychiatrist Kenneth Kendler and his colleagues have conducted a series of twinstudies to investigate the heritability (or genetic basis) of various personality traitsand psychiatric syndromes. Twin studies work by comparing monozygotic (identical)
twins, who share 100 percent of their genes, with dizygotic (fraternal) twins, whoshare only half of their genes. If more monozygotic than dizygotic twins have thesame diagnosis, we can assume that the disorder has a genetic component. By usingvery complex statistical analyses on a sample of 2,794 Norwegian twins, Kendler andcolleagues determined that the ten DSM-IV personality disorder diagnoses were about25 percent attributable to genetics and about 75 percent due to non-genetic causes,such as the environment. Moreover, the authors performed factor analysis to identify
common factors that might influence risk for more than one diagnosis.
Factor analysis works by identifying groups of disorders where twins are similarly
alike or different; if twins are alike on personality disorder X, are they also alike onpersonality disorder Y? In this way, the authors identify factors or groupings of disor-
ders that may share either genetic or environmental influence. Three genetic factorswere identified in this study: an overall negative emotionality factor, an impulsivi-
362Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 362ty/poor behavioral control factor, and an
inhibition/avoidance factor. Interestingly,the environmental contributions did notseem to group together. In other words,the environmental risks appeared to beunique for each personality disorder.
How do we diagnose personality
pathology ?
We diagnose personality pathology by
grouping pathological personality traitsinto categories. The DSM approach topersonality disorders is the official diag-nostic system of the mental health field.The DSM system defines a personalitydisorder as “an enduring pattern of innerexperience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of the individ-ual’s culture, is pervasive and inflexible, has an onset in adolescence or early adult-hood, is stable over time and leads to distress or impairment.” DSM-IV-TR lists tenpersonality disorders grouped into Clusters A, B, and C. The eleventh diagnosis, Per-sonality Disorder Not Otherwise Specified, is intended as a catch basin diagnosis forpeople who do not fit the other ten diagnoses.
Two additional personality diagnoses, depressive and passive-aggressive (negativis-
tic), are listed in the appendix as awaiting further study. Cluster A disorders, whichinclude paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal personality disorders, are characterized byodd or eccentric traits. Cluster B disorders, including histrionic, borderline, narcissis-tic, and antisocial personality disorders, are seen as impulsive and emotionally erratic.Cluster C disorders include avoidant, dependent, and obsessive-compulsive personali-ty disorders and are associated with high anxiety.
What are the strengths and limitations of the DSM-IV diagnoses for
personality disorders?
The DSM-IV diagnoses have shown high inter-rater reliability and internal consisten-cy. In other words, different raters reliably diagnose people in similar ways and the dif-ferent criteria of each diagnosis strongly correlate with one another. Moreover, theyhave been shown to predict to many important clinical features (e.g., suicidality, drugabuse, interpersonal problems, criminal activity). In other words, the DSM personalitydiagnoses are clinically relevant. Nonetheless, there are problems with this system.For one, the categorical approach does not account for severity. It does not saywhether you are mildly or severely borderline, which may matter more than the dis-

meet criteria for more than one diagnosis. Thirdly, the diagnoses are far from exhaus-tive and many types of personality pathology are not easily diagnosed in DSM-IV.
What is the dimensional approach?
While the categorical approach (as seen in DSM) tries to establish a comprehensivelist of personality types, a dimensional approach looks at key personality traits thatvary from person to person. The Five Factor Model of personality has received consid-
erable attention in the research literature. As presented by Paul Costa and RobertMcCrae, the Five Factors include openness to experience, conscientiousness, extra-
version, agreeableness, and neuroticism (OCEAN). These traits were first identified
from factor analytic studies, in which rating scales composed of large lists of emotion-al words were analyzed to see which words grouped together.
The psychological traits grouped into five different categories. The labels for these
categories have varied slightly across different studies, but the OCEAN labels are nowwidely accepted. Even though there is good evidence that these traits are associatedwith clinically relevant outcomes, are stable over time, and have some genetic compo-nent to them, it is important to note that they are derived from statistical analyses ofword lists and not from clinical observations. Therefore, their usefulness in clinicalsettings may be limited. The Five Factor Model has also been criticized because it isdoes not provide an actual theory of personality, only a set of empirical findings.
What is Borderline Personality Disorder?
Borderline Personality Disorder, in its full form, is one of the most severe of the DSM per-sonality disorders. Classified as a Cluster B personality disorder, it is characterized by high-ly erratic and tempestuous behavior. To meet criteria for the DSM-IV diagnosis, the personmust meet at least five of the following criteria: frantic efforts to avoid real or imaginedabandonment; a pattern of very intense and unstable interpersonal relationships withswings between idealizing and devaluing others; identity disturbance reflected in a strik-ingly unstable sense of self; marked impulsivity in at least two areas (e.g., sex, substanceabuse, binge eating); recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures or threats, or self-mutilatingbehavior (such as cutting or burning the self without intent to die); chronic feelings ofemptiness; poorly regulated anger with inappropriate anger outbursts; and transient andstress-induced paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms. Much research haslinked Borderline Personality Disorder with a history of severe trauma, such as childhoodsexual abuse, although not all people with this disorder report such histories.
What is Narcissistic Personality Disorder?
In effect, narcissism refers to a very fragile and unstable sense of self. In order to com-pensate for their fragile self-esteem, narcissistic people become preoccupied with their
364Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 364self-image and are intensely sensitive to perceived shame or humiliation. Typical nar-
cissists have a grandiose sense of self, with an inflated sense of self-importance and anelevated need for attention, status, and recognition. In order to meet criteria for theDSM-IV diagnosis of Narcissistic Personality Disorder, an individual must meet five ofthe following nine criteria: has a grandiose sense of self-importance; has a preoccupa-tion with fantasies of unlimited success; carries a belief that he or she is special andonly can be understood by other special, high status individuals or groups; need forexcessive admiration; displays a sense of entitlement—the assumption that othersshould accommodate to the person’s needs and desires; is interpersonally exploitative;lacks empathy; is often envious of others or believes others are envious of him or her;and exhibits arrogant, haughty attitudes or behaviors.
Is it necessarily bad to be narcissistic?
Some concern with self-esteem, social status, and accomplishment is a universal partof human psychology. Moreover, there are few people who are entirely free of egotisticalor insecure behavior. Thus we can see Narcissistic Personality Disorder as an extremepoint on a range of behavior that includes normal human tendencies. Moreover, thereis a fair amount of research that shows that some degree of narcissism can be adaptive.In a 1984 study by Robert Emmons, several narcissistic traits were correlated withmeasures of adaptive personality traits, such as self-confidence, extraversion, initiative,and ambition. Moreover, in a 2008 study by Eric Russ and colleagues, the authors iden-tified three subtypes of narcissistic personality disorder, which they labeledgrandiose/malignant, fragile, and high-functioning/exhibitionistic. The third subtypeshowed significantly less psychopathology and much higher adaptive functioning thanthe other two groups. Thus, some degree of narcissism may be adaptive with regard toambition, initiative, and self-confidence. People with severe narcissistic traits, however,have significant interpersonal, emotional, and even occupational difficulties.
What is antisocial personality disorder?
People with antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) have a severe deficit in morality.They are characterized by callous and exploitive behavior and by a lack of empathy orremorse. In keeping with the often impulsive and reckless behavior associated withthis disorder, ASPD is classified as a Cluster B personality disorder. A related term forthis type of personality is psychopathy. Unsurprisingly, people with ASPD are particu-larly common in prison populations. According to DSM-IV, a person with this disorderdemonstrates a pervasive pattern of disregard for the rights of others as evidenced byat least three of the following criteria: repeatedly engaging in illegal behavior; fre-quently lying, using aliases, or conning others for personal profit; demonstratingimpulsivity and lack of future planning; exhibiting irritability and aggressiveness;showing reckless disregard for the safety of self and others; being consistently irre-sponsible, with repeated failures to sustain employment or fulfill financial obligations;
365ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY: MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESSHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 365lacking remorse, as evident in indifference to, or rationalization of, hurting, mistreat-
ing, or stealing from others. This definition has been criticized, however, for being toofocused on behavior instead of personality traits and also for requiring evidence ofconduct disorder (a childhood variant of ASPD) before the age of fifteen.
What is schizotypal personality disorder?
Schizotypal personality disorder is quite different from the three personality disorderslisted above. Classified as a Cluster A disorder, people with schizotypal personality dis-order tend to be inhibited and socially withdrawn, which is in sharp contrast to peoplewith Cluster B disorders. In general, schizotypal personality disorder is characterizedby discomfort with social situations and odd, eccentric behavior.
The DSM-IV diagnosis requires five of the following nine criteria: ideas (but not
delusions) of reference; odd beliefs or magical thinking (e.g., suspiciousness, telepa-thy); unusual bodily experiences; odd thinking and speech (e.g., vague or overelabo-rate); suspiciousness or paranoid ideation; inappropriate or constricted affect (expres-sion of emotion); odd, eccentric or peculiar behavior or appearance; lack of closefriends other than close relatives; and excessive social anxiety.
When people have ideas of reference, they believe that events in the environment
pertain to them, although there is actually no connection. For example, someone might
366Are we more narcissistic than we used to be?
Although some degree of narcissism can be adaptive, high levels of narcissismcan cause significant problems. Narcissistic traits appear to be highly suscepti-
ble to the environment, to the kind of feedback or values that people pick up fromtheir social milieu. Thus, there can be a cultural component to narcissistic traits.
In a 2008 study, the psychologist Jean Twenge and colleagues compared
scores on the Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI) from 16,475 college stu-dents who participated in studies conducted between 1979 and 2006. Using thetechnique of meta-analysis, in which data from multiple studies are pooledtogether, the authors found a significant increase in NPI scores over the last sev-eral decades. Using norms from the early 1980s, in 2006 the average student’sscore had increased from the 50th to the 65th percentile. Moreover, the meanscore among college students in 2006 was essentially equivalent to that of a sam-ple of celebrities reported in a 2006 study by Mark Young and Drew Pinsky.Interestingly, the change in NPI scores may be largely due to an increase in nar-cissism among women. While men have traditionally scored higher than womenon the NPI, by 2006 women were closing the gap.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 366walk into a room and think everyone in the room is talking about him or her. People

If your environment supports your behavior, do you still have a 
personality disorder?
By definition, a psychiatric disorder in DSM-IV needs to cause distress or dysfunctionand must be outside the norms of one’s culture. Nonetheless, there are circumstanceswhen people may meet criteria for a DSM-IV personality disorder, but they are shieldedfrom distress or dysfunction from a protective environment. For example, people whoare very powerful, wealthy, or famous may be protected from the negative social conse-quences of behavior that would not be tolerated in less privileged individuals. In factthe newspapers are full of reports of outrageous behavior on the part of celebrities andpoliticians. If these people continue to succeed in their lives in spite of such behavior,does their behavior still meet criteria for a personality disorder? Such a question is noteasily answered, but we can assume that those individuals who truly do suffer from per-sonality pathology will not be able to modify their behavior when it does start to causenegative consequences. Healthier people will be able to adapt as needed.
What changes will be made to the diagnosis of personality disorders in DSM-V?
The APA is proposing fairly radical changes to the diagnosis of personality disorders. Forone, they want to collapse the diagnosis of personality disorders into axis I along with allother psychiatric and even medical disorders. They also remove most of the actual diag-nostic categories, leaving only five personality types, specifically antisocial/psychopathic,avoidant, borderline, obsessive-compulsive, and schizotypal. Each patient will also beevaluated in terms of the severity of his or her impairment in self and interpersonalfunctioning. This will determine the maturity and stability of their understanding ofthemselves and other people. Finally, patients will be rated on six broad personality traitdomains, including negative emotionality, introversion, antagonism, disinhibition,compulsiveness, and schizotypy. Each broad domain has a series of trait facets. Forexample, under disinhibition, there are the trait facets of impulsivity, distractibility, andrecklessness. While this system takes into account much of clinical theory and research,it is also very complex—which might make it hard to apply in real world settings.
SUBSTANCE ABUSE
What is addiction?
In general, the term addiction refers to a state of obsessive desire or craving for some-
thing or some activity, beyond the point of normal use and to the extent of causing 367ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY: MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESSHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 367Was Soviet Union ruler Joseph Stalin a psychopath,
or just a successful dictator?
One of the key assumptions of DSM-IV
is that psychopathology has to cause
distress or dysfunction. In other words ithas to be self-defeating. But what aboutbehavior that causes gross distress anddysfunction to others? If the individualbenefits by his or her behavior but otherpeople suffer, does that count as psy-chopathology? This quandary shows howdifficult it can be at times to determinewhat does and does not constitute psy-chopathology. Additionally, it illustratesthe difficulty in distinguishing betweenpsychopathology and extreme immorality.
Joseph Stalin (1879–1953) is a case
in point. Stalin was appointed generalsecretary of the Communist party in 1922 and gained complete control over theSoviet Union when Vladimir Lenin died in 1924. He retained absolute power untilhis death in 1953. Within five years of Lenin’s death, he was responsible for theexecution of several million people. Stalin brooked no opposition to his regime.Anyone suspected of opposing him or of even having the potential to oppose himmight be deported to Siberia, tortured, and/or executed. He has also been accusedof causing or at least greatly exacerbating famines that killed millions of people.
Historians now believe that Stalin was responsible for the death of—at mini-
mum—20 million people. Would Stalin meet DSM-IV criteria for Antisocial Per-sonality Disorder? It appears that Stalin met at least five DSM-IV criteria for Anti-social Personality Disorder. He repeatedly broke the law before he was in power;and after attaining power he simply created the law to suit his needs. He lied andconned others to maintain his position of absolute power. As a mass murderer hewas clearly irritable and aggressive. He showed reckless disregard for the safety ofothers; he showed lack of remorse for the mistreatment of others.
Stalin also demonstrated aggressive and illegal behavior in his youth, which
may meet criteria for conduct disorder before the age of 15. However, he was abrilliant and immensely successful politician. Despite having murdered tens ofmillions of people, he was able to hold onto power until his death at age 74. Thus,his genocidal behavior may not have caused distress or dysfunction to himself,although it certainly did to others.

369harm. As early as 1964, the World Health Organization discouraged the use of the
word “addiction” in a mental health context, stating that the word had become toocolloquial and was not sufficiently precise. Consequently, the major diagnostic sys-tems, DSM and ICD, diagnose substance abuse and dependence rather than addiction.
Nonetheless, addiction remains a widely used term, within the field as well as the pop-
ular culture. While use of the word “addiction” generally refers to a chemical sub-stance, such as heroin or cocaine, people also speak of behavioral addictions, such ascompulsive gambling or addiction to sex. In fact, a new category of behavioral addic-tions is being considered for DSM-V.
What do recent statistics say about drug use in the United States?
The data below come from the 2007 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, con-ducted by SAMHSA, a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.Data are based on interviews with 67,870 subjects aged 12 or older. Two main findingsstand out. For one, recreational use of substances is extremely widespread, affectingalmost half the U.S. population. Nonetheless, use of highly addictive substances, suchas heroin and methamphetamine, is far less common than use of less addictive sub-stances, such as marijuana and pain relievers. Secondly, there is a large differencebetween lifetime use and recent use, suggesting that recreational drug use is eitherinfrequent or temporary for most people.

Is there a difference between recreational drug use and addiction?
Almost half the U.S. population uses an illicit substance at some point in their life. If weinclude alcohol, the proportion of people who engage in recreational substance use is farHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 369higher. Many people can use psychoactive substances without harm. Addiction, however,
is an entirely different animal. Severe addiction, particularly to the most addictive sub-stances such as heroin, cocaine, or methamphetamine, lays waste to peoples’ lives.Careers, physical health, families, and even whole communities can be destroyed bydrug addiction. Furthermore, approximately 10 percent of people with substance depen-dence commit suicide, generally in the midst of a substance-induced depression.
What is the difference between addiction, substance abuse, and
substance dependence?
The term addiction is somewhat of an umbrella term referring to any kind of compul-
sive use or excessive dependence on a substance or activity. In the DSM-IV, substance
abuse is characterized by excessive use which continues despite significant negative
consequences. More specifically, substance abuse requires recurrent use of the sub-stance, resulting in failure to meet major role obligations; exposure to situations thatare physically hazardous (e.g., drunk driving); recurrent legal problems; and contin-ued use despite repeated negative social consequences.
Substance dependence is a more
severe disorder. In addition to causingsocial, occupational, and/or financial prob-lems, substance dependence also requiresa physiological addiction to the drug. Thetwo most important features involve toler-ance and withdrawal. Additionally, there
can be an increase in the amount of sub-stance used over time, a persistent desireto cut down, or unsuccessful efforts to doso, considerable amounts of time spent inpursuit of the substance, sacrifice ofimportant life activities because of sub-stance use, and/or the continued use ofthe substance despite clear physiologicalor psychological damage from it.
What do tolerance and
withdrawal mean?
When people develop tolerance, they havebecome desensitized to the drug andrequire more and more of the substanceto achieve the same effect. Differentdrugs vary as to how likely they are to
370
People with substance abuse continue to use drugs despite
negative consequences, while people with substancedependence also experience drug tolerance and withdrawal(Stock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 370cause tolerance. For example, tolerance for amphetamine and opiates is generally
stronger than that for alcohol. In fact, people who abuse opiates, such as heroin ormorphine, can develop a tolerance for the analgesic (pain-killing) effects that can lastfor years after the end of the substance abuse. Consequently, people with a history ofopiate abuse or dependence often require much more opiates to treat pain than theaverage person.
Withdrawal refers to physiological symptoms that occur when the substance is
discontinued. Because the brain has become adapted to the chemical, removal of thechemical sends the brain into a disregulated state. Withdrawal can be extremelypainful as well as dangerous. Depending on the substance, withdrawal symptoms caninclude changes in heart rate, vomiting, confusion, pain, and even seizures. Theeffects of withdrawal are generally opposite to the effects of intoxication. For example,people become energetic and euphoric during cocaine intoxication, but experiencefatigue and depression during cocaine withdrawal.
Are addictions pleasurable?
Few people suffering from substance dependence would say that addictions are plea-surable. Many addicts will say that the use of the drug was initially pleasurable, butthat as the addiction set in, the pleasure was counterbalanced by craving. At thispoint, they used the drug to reduce the discomfort of craving or withdrawal as muchas to bring pleasure.
What role does dopamine have in addiction?
A growing body of research points to the central role of the dopamine system in chem-ical, and even behavioral, addictions. Drugs such as cocaine, amphetamine, and nico-tine have a direct effect on the dopamine system. Other drugs, such as heroin andmarijuana may have an indirect effect on this system. The dopamine neurons origi-nate deep in a region of the midbrain called the ventral tegmental area. These
dopamine neurons course through the middle of the brain, connecting with a smallstructure in the forebrain known as the nucleus accumbens.
This system is known as the mesolimbic dopamine tract and is a central part of
the dopamine reward system , which seems to be involved in the activation of the
organism to pursue rewarding stimuli. In other words, this system is central to an ani-mal’s experience of desire and motivation. Activation of the reward system stimulatespleasurable feelings of euphoria, energy, and enthusiasm. Many drugs of abuse directlystimulate this chemical system, providing an immediate and intensely pleasurableexperience. In effect, they mimic the brain’s natural chemicals.
Unfortunately, nature allows no free lunch. Over time, activating the dopamine
reward system by outside chemicals changes the structure of the brain, reducing itsability to regulate the dopamine system.
371ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY: MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESSHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 371How does drug addiction change the brain?
Drugs of abuse act on the brain’s neurotransmitters, the chemical messengers that
coordinate interactions between neurons (brain cells). Because of the direct effect of
substances of abuse on neurotransmitters, there is often a dramatic change in neuro-transmitter function. For example, in response to foreign chemicals that mimic theactivity of neurotransmitters, the neurons may decrease production of their own neu-rotransmitters. Receptor sites may die off. This change of the actual structure of theneurons contributes to the addictive process. When the brain makes less neurotrans-mitter or is less able to process it, craving sets in. Drug tolerance, the need for moreand more of the same drug to achieve the same psychological effect, is also related tothe changes in the neuron’s structure. Moreover, changes to the neurons can lead to areduction in brain volume, in other words, brain shrinkage. This is associated withcognitive, emotional, and physiological deterioration.
Are some drugs more addictive than others?
There are at least two ways that drugs can vary in their addictive potential. One is thedrug’s half-life, which refers to the time it takes for the drug to pass through the body.Drugs with a short half-life often have very quick effects, but also have sharp with-drawal reactions, which can contribute to addiction. Drugs with longer half-lives havea less quick and intense high and cause less abrupt withdrawal syndromes. However,their withdrawal syndromes can last longer as it takes more time for the drug to fullyclear the system. The intensity of the dopamine spike that a drug causes also affects itsaddiction potential. Although drugs such as cocaine, nicotine, and amphetamine allcause an increase in dopamine activity, they vary tremendously in terms of thestrength of the spikes they cause.
Why is methamphetamine so addictive?
Methamphetamine (also known as meth, crystal meth, ice, and crank) is a fairly newdrug of abuse that has swept out from the West Coast, across the center of the UnitedStates, and is now moving into the East Coast. Although its popularity in the UnitedStates is fairly recent, it was first developed in the nineteenth century and used by theJapanese and the Germans during World War II. It is a devastatingly addictive drug,which can make short shrift of substance abusers in relatively little time.
One of the reasons it is so powerfully addictive is that it causes a dopamine spike
much stronger than cocaine and vastly larger than nicotine. This spike is ten to 12times higher than baseline levels and five to ten times higher than the spikes causedby natural rewards such as food or sex. Moreover, it lasts for hours. Tragically, thisgreatly enhanced release of dopamine damages the dopamine neurons in a processcalled neurotoxicity. Changes in the dopamine neurons takes place within days of use,both within humans and animals, and the effects can last for months or years.

Is there a genetic basis to addiction?
A fair amount of research in the past few decades has pointed to a genetic componentto addiction. Specific genes related to the neurotransmitter serotonin have beenlinked to early-onset alcoholism, though it is unclear if this is related to alcoholismper se, or to poor behavioral control. In addition, Kenneth Kendler and colleagueshave performed twin studies looking at the relative contribution of genes and environ-ment to the abuse of, or dependence on, six different substances: cannabis (marijua-na), cocaine, hallucinogens, sedatives, stimulants, and opiates. From their comparisonof 1,196 male-male twin pairs, the authors concluded that on average, each form ofdrug addiction was about 55 percent attributable to genetics and 45 percent attribut-able to environment.
373ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY: MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESSHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 373Moreover, there appeared to be a genetic vulnerability to developing drug addic-
tion in general, but not to developing an addiction to any particular drug. Similarly,
there was a general effect of environment, influencing the likelihood of any kind ofdrug abuse/dependence rather than abuse of a specific drug. Interestingly, opiateaddiction seemed more heavily influenced by environment (78 percent) than genetics(23 percent). Perhaps opiates are less available than other drugs and, as a result, opi-ate abuse is heavily dependent on exposure to drugs in the environment.
What is the relationship of childhood trauma and addiction?
There is considerable evidence of an association between trauma and neglect inchildhood and addiction in adulthood. In other words, adults with addictionreport a higher incidence of childhood trauma and neglect than adults withoutaddiction. Both psychological and neurobiological research show that inadequateparenting and harmful childhood experiences can deeply interfere with the devel-opment of mature self-control, including the ability to regulate emotion andbehavior. In these circumstances, drug use can be very attractive because it serves(at least at first) to reduce negative emotion and enhance positive emotion. In theabsence of effective emotional regulation skills, any shortcut to positive emotioncan be very appealing. Moreover, people with poor impulse control are less likelyto monitor their drug use. As a result, recreational drug use is more likely to esca-late into addiction.

What is the relationship between addiction and crime?
For a number of different reasons, drug addiction does contribute to crime. For one,the addiction may destroy the person’s ability to hold a job, removing the means to
375ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY: MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESSHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 375pay for the drug. In this situation, drug addicts may turn to crime in order to obtain
the money needed to pay for their drug. Common forms of criminal activity includerobbery, drug dealing, and prostitution. Secondly, many drugs of abuse impair judg-ment and impulse control, which increases the likelihood of reckless and criminalacts. In fact, it has been estimated that 55 percent of car accidents and more than 50percent of murders involve alcohol intoxication. Thirdly, most Western countries out-law the most common drugs of abuse. Unfortunately, this fails to erase demand for thedrugs (though many argue that it does decrease demand). Consequently, the market
for illicit drugs goes underground and becomes the domain of criminals. Competitionwithin the illicit drug trade has led to a tremendous amount of violence, dating backto the days of Al Capone in the 1920s.
How much control do addicts have over their addiction?
Drug addiction is not a psychotic disorder. People are always aware of their drug useand of their choice to use. Thus, we cannot say addicted individuals have no choiceand no control over their drug use. Nonetheless, it is important to realize that addic-tion changes the brain. In the most addictive drugs, the cravings are overwhelmingand the ability to inhibit self-destructive behavior is very weak. This is because theparts of the brain that monitor behavior, employ social judgment, and inhibit harmfulactions are significantly compromised at the same time that the reward system is onoverdrive. Therefore, it is fair to say that addicted individuals have some control overtheir behavior but far, far less control than a non-addicted person.
What are the stages of change?
The motivation to change is a major factor in addiction treatment. Some addicts havelittle to no motivation to change their behavior. Or their motivation may not be sus-tained. In 1994, James Prochaska, John Norcross, and Carlo DiClemente publishedtheir model of the stages of change , which describes six different stages that people go
through when deciding to change addictive behaviors. This work has been widely inte-grated into addiction treatments.
The first stage is called pre-contemplation . At this point the individual does not
believe he or she has a problem and is resistant to suggestions to change. There maybe considerable denial about the extent of the problem.
The next stage is called contemplation. In this stage, the individual is aware there
is a problem and is beginning to consider taking action to change. The third stage isknown as preparation. The person is now taking steps in preparation of change. Forexample, he or she may start researching drug treatment options or talking to familyand friends about the need to stop using the drug. Nonetheless, there is still ambiva-lence about giving up the substance.
376Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 376The fourth stage is termed action. At this point, the person takes actual steps to
stop the substance use. This may involve joining a twelve-step group, an outpatient
treatment center, or even getting admitted for inpatient treatment. The person alsorecognizes the need to change a broad array of psychological and social patterns asso-ciated with the addiction.
In the fifth maintenance phase, the person has successfully stopped using the sub-
stance. Still, there is ongoing risk of relapse and the person needs to take care to pre-vent backsliding. There will be need for ongoing support and treatment, often in theform of a twelve-step group such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). There is also need forcontinuing attention to ways of handling emotions, relationships, and responsibilities.
In the final phase, termination, the person has successfully mastered the addic-
tion. The temptation to use is no longer a significant danger. Nonetheless, people donot necessarily travel through these stages in a straightforward manner, and there isfrequently movement back and forth between the stages.
What kinds of treatments are used for addiction?
Fortunately, there are many treatments for addiction. Medications are available totreat withdrawal, decrease drug cravings, or reduce enjoyment of the substance. Psy-chosocial treatments include a wide variety of therapies designed to help the addictedindividual choose to stop using the drug, combat cravings, and handle the emotionaland interpersonal challenges of daily life without resorting to substances.
Treatments vary from the least to the most restrictive. Depending on the severity
of the addiction, including the motivation to stop the drug, the level of functioning inthe community, the presence of co-existing psychiatric or medical problems, and thelevel of family support, the addicted individual may need more or less structure intheir treatment. Higher functioning individuals with less debilitating addictions maybe successfully treated in an outpatient setting or a twelve-step program such as Alco-holics Anonymous.
People whose addiction has more thoroughly taken over their lives may need
greater structure, such as inpatient detoxification (where they are helped through thewithdrawal process), inpatient rehab (where their addiction is addressed in a short-term residential setting), or longer term therapeutic communities, where the patientmay stay for up to one to two years.
What are the pharmacological treatments for addiction?
A number of pharmacological agents (medications) are used to treat withdrawal. Ingeneral, withdrawal is treated with a drug that is similar to the drug of abuse. In thisway, the individual is weaned off the chemical substance slowly. Common medicationsfor alcohol withdrawal include a class of antianxiety drugs known as benzodiazepines,
377ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY: MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESSHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 377particularly diazepam (brand name Valium) and chlordiazepoxide (Librium). With-
drawal from opiates, such as heroin, opium, morphine, or oxycodone (OxyContin), isoften treated with methadone or clonidine. Methadone maintenance is the most com-mon pharmacological treatment of opiate addiction, serving to reduce craving andwithdrawal. Naltrexone is also used to reduce craving by blocking the reinforcingeffects of both opiates and alcohol.
What is methadone and how does it help?
Methadone is a long-acting opiate that is dispensed to opiate-addicted individualsunder the supervision of licensed methadone maintenance clinics. Because it is longeracting than most opiates of abuse, it is easier for the individual to maintain steadyblood levels of the drug, which reduces the incidence of withdrawal and craving. Italso gives much less of a high than other opiates, so it is less likely to be used as arecreational drug. There is considerable research that methadone maintenancereduces the crime, violence, medical problems, and mortality associated with severeopiate addiction. Nonetheless, there is controversy around methadone maintenancebecause many individuals may stay on methadone for many years rather than becom-ing entirely drug-free. Alternative medications to treat opiate addiction includebuprenorphine and LAAM. LAAM, however, is no longer available in the United Statesor Europe due to rare cardiac side effects.
What is Antabuse and how does it help?
Disulfiram (brand name Antabuse) is used to treat alcoholism by causing uncomfortablephysical reactions to alcohol. Disulfiram interferes with the metabolism of alcohol.Drinking alcohol after taking disulfiram causes nausea, vomiting, and many otherunpleasant symptoms. As the medication stays in the system for at least a week, it can bea potent motivator not to drink. However, long-term use of this medication is notadvised because it can cause liver damage. Additionally, drinking while on disulfiram ispotentially fatal, so it is not recommended for impulsive patients, those who might drinkdespite knowledge of the consequences. Finally, this treatment is only useful with highlymotivated patients, those who are willing to take the medication and avoid alcohol.Someone who is poorly motivated to stop drinking will simply stop taking the Antabuse.
What psychological treatments are most useful for addictions?
There are many psychological treatments for addictions. Group therapies are useful indecreasing the stigma of the addiction, confronting denial of the problem, and provid-ing encouragement and support for the struggle toward sobriety. As social animals, weare all highly suggestive to peer influences and tend to conform to group norms. Ingroup therapies, this universal tendency can be put to constructive use. Individualtherapies focus on the skills needed to live without substances. Such therapies provide
378Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 378education about the effects of addiction, build coping skills to handle cravings and
avoid relapse, and help the person to rebuild relationships and handle stress withoutusing substances.
Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a relatively recent technique developed by William
Miller and Stephen Rollnick. MI addresses clients’ ambivalence about changing theirbehavior. In this brief intervention, clients are asked to consider the pros and cons ofsubstance use and to identify their own personal goals. In a nonjudgmental and reflec-tive manner, counselors aim to guide clients toward greater motivation to change.
What are twelve-step programs?
While most treatments of substance abuse depend on mental health professionals,twelve-step programs are entirely member run. Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) was thefirst twelve-step program. Started in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Dr. Robert Smith, a NewYork stockbroker and an Ohio surgeon, AA now has over two million members in over150 countries worldwide. AA offers support groups for alcoholics who wish to stopdrinking alcohol. Members can attend daily meetings or even multiple meetings perday, depending on availability of meetings. The original publication, entitled Alco-
holics Anonymous, was first published in 1939 and is now in its fourth edition. Itoffers specific guidelines on how to change behavior and maintain sobriety, includingthe twelve-step program toward recovery. The twelve steps include such measures as

ing an honest moral inventory of oneself, and making amends for past misbehavior.Numerous other twelve-step programs have arisen, such as Narcotics Anonymous,Overeaters Anonymous, Sex Addicts Anonymous, and Gamblers Anonymous.
PSYCHOTHERAPY
What is psychotherapy?
Fundamentally, psychotherapy involves talking. Patients bring their psychological dif-ficulties into treatment. Therapists aim to reduce a patient’s suffering via verbal dis-cussion. Granted, psychotherapy involves far more than just conversation, but it isdistinguished from other kinds of therapies—such as physical, speech, occupational,or medical therapy—by its emphasis on talking. In fact, Anna O., one of the world’s
first psychotherapy patients, described it as the “talking cure.” Anna O. (a.k.a. BerthaPapenheimer) was one of Sigmund Freud’s case histories, written up in his 1895 Stud-ies on Hysteria.
How does psychotherapy work?
There are at least three mechanisms through which psychotherapy helps people feelbetter: social support, insight , and skills building. A large body of research shows the
powerful effect of social support in just about all aspects of psychological health. Whenpeople are under stress, it is extremely helpful for them to talk out their problems withanother person. Nonetheless, psychotherapy provides more than just social support.Otherwise, there would be no need for trained professionals—friends and family woulddo just as well. Psychotherapy also helps people gain insight. It helps them learn abouttheir motivations, emotions, and behavior, along with their effect on others.
With greater self-understanding, people are better equipped to handle life’s chal-
lenges. Additionally, some people lack the necessary psychological skills to functionwell in life. For example, they could have difficulty managing anger, negotiating con-flict, maintaining positive emotion, confronting anxiety-provoking stimuli, or control-ling self-destructive impulses. Psychotherapy can teach people new skills to betterhandle these challenges.
Does psychotherapy work?
Originally, there was little scientific data to back up psychotherapists’ claims about theeffectiveness of psychotherapy. People had to rely on the testimony of psychothera-pists which, for many skeptics, was not particularly convincing. The empirical study ofpsychotherapy started in the 1950s, however, and within a few decades grew into a
380Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 380large movement. There now exists an entire field of psychotherapy research and there
is substantial data supporting the positive effects of psychotherapy. Consequently, wecan now state with confidence: Yes, psychotherapy does work.
What are the major schools of psychotherapy?
Although new types of psychotherapy are constantly arising, there are perhaps threemajor schools of psychotherapy: psychoanalytic or psychodynamic approaches, cogni-tive-behavioral approaches, and humanistic approaches. Additional schools of psy-chotherapy include family systems approaches and group psychotherapy.
381ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY: MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESS
What did a 1995 Consumer Reports survey
say about the effectiveness of psychotherapy?
In 1995 the magazine Consumer Reports published a large study on the effects
of psychotherapy. The mental health questionnaire was sent out as part of a
larger study polling readers on their opinions of appliances and services. Out ofthe 180,000 people sent the questionnaire, 22,000 responded and 7,000 answeredthe mental health questions. Of these, 3,000 people had discussed emotionalproblems with family, friends, or clergy; 4,100 had turned to some combinationof mental health professionals, support groups, or family physicians; and 2,900had consulted a mental health professional, most frequently a psychologist(37%), psychiatrist (22%), or social worker (14%).
The survey showed very positive results for psychotherapy when provided by
a trained mental health professional. Ninety percent of those who felt very pooror fairly poor at the start of treatment reported feeling very good, good, or atleast so-so at the time of the survey. Moreover, people who stayed in therapylonger did better. People treated by psychologists, psychiatrists, and social work-ers did better than those treated by other professionals, and the difference waslarger over time. No specific type of therapy worked better than any other.
It is important to note, however, that this is a very different kind of study
than most psychotherapy research. Most psychotherapy studies are highly con-trolled efficacy studies, with fixed length therapies, manualized treatments, and
specific criteria for selecting patients. This effectiveness study is much less con-
trolled but much more representative of the real world. Patients pick their owntherapists, present with all manner of problems, and stay in therapy as long asthey and their therapist agree to continue. Moreover the therapist can tailor thetreatment to the patient, which might account for the lack of difference betweentypes of treatments. If a treatment is not working, the therapist may haveswitched to another approach.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 381What is psychoanalysis?
Psychoanalysis started under Sigmund Freud (1856–1939). Although there have been
many developments since his death in 1939, certain pillars of the discipline remain. Psy-choanalysis aims to alleviate emotional distress by bringing unconscious patterns ofthought, emotion, and desire into awareness. This is done through long-term explorationof the person’s mental processes in a one-to-one relationship with the psychoanalyst.
Classical psychoanalysis involves three to five sessions per week, during which the
analysand (patient) lies on a couch with the psychoanalyst sitting behind, out of view.
This arrangement is intended to create a relaxed and reflective state of mind, in whichthe analysand can access the depths of his or her mind. The analysand is instructed toexpress whatever thoughts pop into awareness, a process known as free association.
Psychoanalysts also believe that early childhood experiences and relationships haveprofound influence on adult relationships. Through the process of free association,unconscious childhood feelings and beliefs can emerge to be understood andreworked with the tools of a mature adult mind.
What is psychodynamic therapy?
While psychoanalytic theory has had tremendous influence on the mental health fieldas a whole, the practice of classical psychoanalysis has become far less common thanit was in its heyday in the first half of the twentieth century. Psychodynamic psy-
chotherapy has adjusted to the financial and schedule constraints of modern life. In
typical psychodynamic therapy, there are one to two forty-five- to fifty-minute sessionsper week. Both therapist and patient sit up and face each other. There is no couch. Theemphasis on unconscious patterns of thought, emotion, and desire is retained, howev-er, as well as the belief that patterns learned in childhood influence adult emotionalexperiences and ways of relating to others.
As with psychoanalysis, psychodynamic therapy tends to be of indefinite length
(often for many years) and relatively non-directive. The therapist aims to guide self-exploration, rather than provide answers or educate the patient in new modes ofbehavior. In other words, both psychoanalysis and psychodynamic therapy providesocial support and promote insight, but neither one teaches specific skills.
What are transference and countertransference?
Transference and counter-transference are central concepts to both psychoanalysisand psychodynamic psychotherapy. Early in the development of psychoanalysis, Freudrealized that analysands can develop inappropriately intense feelings about their ana-lysts. He quickly recognized this transference to be part of the clinical material,
believing the patient is likely to “transfer” his or her psychic conflicts onto the analyst.Through exploring the analysand’s feelings about the analyst, much can be learnedabout the inner workings of the analysand’s mind.
382Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 382Counter-transference occurs when the analyst develops inappropriate and intense
feelings about the analysand. In the early days of psychoanalysis, counter-transference
was seen mainly as a negative, reflecting childish responses on the part of the analystthat were best suppressed and controlled. In current approaches to psychodynamicwork, counter-transference is now incorporated into the therapeutic work. Whenworking with either transference or counter-transference, however, it is extremelyimportant that the analyst proceed with tact and care. Direct discussion of the rela-tionship between therapist and patient can be awkward and stressful, and the therapistmust introduce such topics carefully and in a constructive manner.
What is the difference between a one-person and a two-person model
of psychoanalysis?
In the last few decades, newer schools of psychoanalysis, such as the interpersonal andrelational schools, have moved from a one-person to a two-person psychology. This
means that contemporary psychoanalytic therapists no longer believe in the blank
screen model of psychoanalysis. In this model, the patient’s experience within the
therapy is seen solely as a product of the patient’s mental processes. The therapist issimply a blank screen onto which the patient projects his or her own feelings andthoughts. The therapist makes no contribution to the patient’s experience.
Contemporary psychoanalytic thinkers now believe that both therapist and
patient contribute to the therapeutic relationship. The therapist is a living, feeling,and reacting human being. No matter how controlled the therapist’s behavior may be,it is impossible to remove the human element from a therapist’s technique.
Moreover, the emotional experience of the therapist can be a very valuable source
of information, both about the interpersonal process within the therapy and thepatient’s emotional experience. For example, if the therapist starts feeling annoyedand irritated during the session, this might reflect passive-aggressive behavior on thepart of the patient. Likewise, if the therapist starts feeling sad, this may reflect unac-knowledged sad feelings on the part of the patient. Clearly the therapist’s counter-transference needs to be interpreted with caution, so the patient is not unfairly heldaccountable for the therapist’s emotional state. Consequently, both psychoanalysis andpsychodynamic therapy require years of training.
What do psychoanalysts mean by defense mechanisms?
According to psychoanalytic theory, we use defense mechanisms to protect ourselves
from feelings and thoughts that make us anxious. Through these mental manipulations,we keep ourselves blissfully unaware of uncomfortable information. In her classic 1936book, The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defense , Anna Freud (1895–1982) listed ten
defense mechanisms. Anna Freud was the youngest of Sigmund Freud’s six children.
383ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY: MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESSHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 383Types of Defense Mechanisms
Defense Mechanism Explanation
Displacement Here the person expresses feelings toward one person or
situation that are really aimed at another. For example, a
child might express anger at her babysitter when she is reallyangry at the parent who left to go on a business trip.
Introjection In introjection, people internalize the person or action that
has caused anxiety, thus moving from the passive to theactive role. For example, a child who has been bullied maystart to bully other children as a way of mastering his or hersense of powerlessness. This is similar to the process ofidentifying with the aggressor.
Isolation In isolation, the intellectual awareness of an event isdisconnected from emotional experience. The person isaware of everything that happened, but is completely out oftouch with the emotional meaning of the event.
Projection When people project emotion onto another person, they are
attributing their own emotion to that person. In effect, theyare saying, “I don’t hate you. You hate me.”
Regression In regression, a person avoids anxiety by reverting back to anearlier developmental stage. For example, adolescents afraidof their budding sexuality might regress to their pre-sexualchildhood.
Repression Sigmund Freud believed repression to be the primary
defense mechanism used to ward off threatening mentalcontent. In repression, disturbing emotions, thoughts andmemories are pushed entirely out of awareness.
Reaction Formation Here the person expresses the opposite feeling from what is
truly felt. For example, a rageful person becomes overlysolicitous of the other person. An unconsciously rebelliousperson becomes excessively compliant.
Reversal or Turning When people cannot bear feeling negative emotions towardagainst the Self another person, they might turn the emotion inward, for
example, berating and punishing themselves rather thanacknowledging the real source of their anger.
Sublimation Here the person redirects the forbidden impulse into asocially valued activity. For example, childhood aggressionmay be sublimated into a career as a surgeon.
Undoing When people are terribly ambivalent about something, theymay express one emotion with one action and then undotheir action as a way of expressing the opposite emotion.
384Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 384What is behavioral psychotherapy?
Behavioral psychotherapy came out of the academic tradition of behaviorism . Behav-
iorism proposed two primary ways by which people learn a new behavior: classical and
operant conditioning. These principals were established through scientific researchconducted in the early twentieth century. It was not until the 1950s, however, thatbehaviorist principals were adapted into psychotherapy techniques.
What is classical conditioning?
In classical conditioning, people learn to respond to a neutral object or event (the
conditioned stimulus or CS) in a new way when it is paired with an emotionally mean-
ingful object or event (the unconditioned stimulus or UCS). For example, we may
develop strong feelings about a particular song (CS) because we associate with anemotionally important time in our life (UCS), such as a romantic break up or greatvacation. The new learned reaction is known as the conditioned response (CR).
How is classical conditioning used in psychotherapy?
Classical conditioning techniques are extremely effective in the treatment of anxietydisorders. In these disorders, the people have learned to associate various stimuli with
fear. To treat the anxiety disorder, it is necessary to dissociate the feared object (e.g.,dogs) from the fear reaction. In this way, the conditioned stimulus (dogs) is discon-nected from the conditioned response (fear of dogs). Techniques such as flooding andsystematic desensitization expose people to their feared objects, either gradually (sys-tematic desensitization) or all at once (flooding). When no harm comes from theexposure to the object, the fear response diminishes. The conditioned stimulusbecomes decoupled from the conditioned response and, voilá, the person is no longerafraid of dogs. Further, a new association can be created between the formerly fearedobject and feelings of relaxation and calm. In other words, a pairing is made betweenthe conditioned stimulus and a new (positive) conditioned response. Relaxation train-ing, involving techniques such as deep breathing, visualization of a pleasant scene,and progressive muscle relaxation, can be used to help the person feel relaxed when inthe presence of the formerly feared object.
What is systematic desensitization?
One of the most commonly used techniques to help people unlearn fear conditioningis called systematic desensitization. People are first asked to create a hierarchy of situ-ations in which they might feel anxious. For example, people who are afraid of dogsmight first list thinking about a dog, then seeing a picture of a dog, then seeing a dogfrom far away, then seeing a dog in a cage, then seeing a dog ten feet away, then fivefeet away, then standing right next to a dog, and then finally petting the dog. Using a
385ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY: MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESSHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 385scale from 0 to 100, each situation is scored as to how much anxiety it elicits. Imagin-
ing a dog might get a rating of 5, seeing a picture of a dog a score of 10, and touchinga dog a score of 65.
The client is then taught relaxation strategies, in order to learn to feel calm when
in the anxiety-provoking situation. Next the client is exposed to the situations listedon the hierarchy, starting with the least anxiety-provoking (imagining the dog) andgradually moving up the list to the most anxiety-provoking (petting the dog). At eachpoint, clients are instructed to use relaxation techniques until they can tolerate eachstep on the hierarchy without undue anxiety. This is an extremely effective technique,and it is used to help people overcome all manner of anxiety problems, including thefear of flying, public speaking, heights, or test taking.
How does operant conditioning work?
According to the principles of operant conditioning, the likelihood that a behavior willbe repeated depends upon the consequences of that behavior. Rewarded behaviors aremore likely to be repeated, punished behaviors are less so. Therefore, you can changebehavior by modifying its consequences.
How are operant conditioning principles applied in psychotherapy?
Behavioral modification, as championed by B.F . Skinner (1904–1990) in the 1950s,relies on the principals of operant conditioning. It employs carefully designed rewards(or positive reinforcement) to encourage desirable behavior. Likewise, removal of keyrewards reduces incentive for undesirable behavior. Alternatively, punishment can be
used to decrease frequency of undesirable behavior. Punishment is used less frequent-ly than positive reinforcement, however, because it tends to elicit negative reactions.In sum, behavioral modification changes behavior by manipulating the rewards andpunishments that motivate people to perform the behavior.
Such techniques are used in child rearing and animal training as well as the treat-
ment of emotionally disturbed children and individuals with mental retardation. Oper-ant conditioning techniques are also widely used in situations requiring some degree ofsocial control, for example in prisons, schools, and even the workplace. They are less fre-quently used in individual therapy, as such techniques are most useful for people wholack internal motivation to change their behavior. For the most part, people seeking out
psychotherapy on their own do so because they are already motivated to change.
What is cognitive psychotherapy?
Behaviorism dominated American academic psychology well into the 1960s, at whichpoint the cognitive revolution brought the mind back to scientific respectability. Pre-viously, behaviorists had thoroughly dismissed subjective experiences as unworthy of
386Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 386scientific attention. Taking advantage of this movement, psychologists such as Aaron
Beck (1921–), Albert Ellis (1913–2007), and Martin Seligman (1942–), developed anew form of psychotherapy, known as cognitive psychotherapy.
All three branches of cognitive therapy start from the premise that psychological
distress can be linked to maladaptive thoughts. Negative thoughts stimulate negative
emotions, which in turn motivate self-defeating behavior. The negative consequencesof these patterns reinforce the problematic thoughts, creating a vicious cycle. Unlikepsychoanalytic treatment, which explores psychological distress in an open-ended,nondirective way, cognitive therapists actively identify unhealthy thought processes,and train patients to restructure their thoughts into healthier responses.
387ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY: MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESS
What are the ABCs of behavioral therapy?
One of the cornerstones of behavioral therapy involves identifying the conse-quences of various behaviors. If you want to change a person’s behavior, you
have to consider what is reinforcing that behavior. Are there positive conse-quences that motivate the person to perform the behavior? Often the answer isnot so obvious.
One of the basic techniques of behavioral therapy is functional behavioral
analysis. In this process the behavior is observed carefully and a log is kept of theantecedents (what happened before?), behaviors (what exactly did the person do?),
and consequences (what happened afterwards?), otherwise known as the ABCs.
After the target behavior has been studied this way, it is possible to identify
what reinforces the behavior. For example, a toddler may throw up every nightand the parents do not know why. Functional behavioral analysis might showthat the toddler throws up at night after the parents put the child down to sleep.First the child cries to get her parents back into the room. The parents resist fora while but when the mother gives in, the child vomits. At that point the motherspends up to 45 minutes with the child, cleaning her up and soothing her. Thisfunctional analysis makes clear that vomiting is reinforcing for the childbecause it brings her mother’s attention. The treatment for this kind of problemwould be to change the contingencies of the child’s crying. Instead of entering
the room to reassure the child in response to the child’s crying, the parentshould enter the room at a fixed time interval. This way the child’s crying losesthe power to control the parents’ behavior. The parent first enters the room at afrequent rate, so that the child is only left alone for short time periods. The par-ent then spaces out the time intervals so that the child slowly adapts to fallingasleep without the parent. This process is the basis of the Ferber method, a well-known technique for conditioning babies to sleep through the night.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 387What are cognitive distortions?
In cognitive therapy, therapists point out how patients experience the world through
the filter of cognitive distortions . These are habitual ways of thinking that contribute
to a depressive mindset. Information is distorted to maintain a negative and pes-simistic world view. In his book Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy the psychiatrist
David Burns listed the following cognitive distortions.
 All-or-Nothing Thinking: Life is seen in black and white. If you are not com-
pletely successful, you are a total failure.
 Overgeneralization: You generalize from a single negative event to a much larg-
er pattern. One bad experience means a lifetime of disappointment.
 Mental Filter: You hone in on one negative detail and let that detail cloud your
view of the larger picture. After giving a wonderful party, you focus on the oneguest who seemed to be in a bad mood.
 Disqualifying the Positive: You find reasons to discount positive information.
You passed the test because it was easy. The cute girl next door was nice to youbecause she felt sorry for you. This type of cognitive distortion allows you tomaintain your negative view of the world despite contradictory evidence.
 Jumping to Conclusions: You jump to negative conclusions in the absence of
any evidence.
 Mind Reading: You assume you know what someone else is feeling or thinking
about you and that their thoughts are necessarily negative.
 Predicting the Future: You predict that things will end up badly and then treat
your predictions as if they were already fact.
 Catastrophizing or Minimizing: In catastrophic thinking, you exaggerate the
negative impact or significance of an event, blowing it up into giant proportions.When minimizing, you reduce the importance of something, generally some-thing positive.
 Emotional Reasoning: You don’t distinguish between your emotions and out-
side reality. Just because you feel something, you assume it must be true.
 Shoulding: You feel you can only motivate yourself with a constant sense of
guilt or obligation. You “should”, “must”, or “ought to” do all sorts of things.You cannot trust yourself to act appropriately unless you are forced to do so.
 Labeling: A negative event or behavior is generalized to the person’s entire char-
acter. For example, your husband is a selfish lout, you are a pathetic wreck, andyour neighbor is total snob.
 Personalization: You assume that you were the cause of something that may
have had nothing to do with you. Your boss shuts himself in his office becausehe’s mad at you. Your best friend is depressed because you weren’t sensitiveenough when she broke up with her boyfriend.
388Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 388What are humanistic therapies?
Humanistic therapies arose in the middle of the twentieth century, to some extent in
reaction against the two reigning pillars of American psychology. Behaviorism domi-nated academic psychology, and psychoanalysis dominated clinical psychology.Humanistic therapies—as championed by psychotherapists such as Carl Rogers(1902–1987), Fritz Perls (1893–1970), Victor Frankl (1905–1997) and Rollo May(1909–1994)—were considered the third force in psychology, providing an alternativeto the two earlier movements. While psychoanalysis focused on the relief of psychologi-cal conflict, and behaviorism focused on changing behavior, humanistic psychologyemphasized the potential for growth. Concepts such as self-actualization, uncondition-al positive regard, and the search for meaning highlighted the basic human need to
find fulfillment, happiness, and meaning in life.
The aim of humanistic therapy is less the reduction of psychopathology, than the
realization of human potential. Emphasis is less on the past, as with psychoanalysis andpsychodynamic therapies, and more on the present. Moreover, there is a spiritual sideto humanistic psychotherapy that is completely absent in the two other movements
There is a fair amount of overlap between humanistic and psychodynamic psychother-
apies, however, and many of the pioneering humanistic psychologists were initially trainedin psychoanalysis. Both types of therapy engage the patient in one-on-one discussions witha psychotherapist. Both presume that verbal exploration of emotionally relevant thoughts,feelings, and problems can help people improve their lives. Finally, both types of treatmentfocus on how people deal with emotions and relate to other people.
What is the empty chair technique?
The empty chair technique is a popular technique used in Gestalt therapy, a branch ofpsychotherapy founded by Fritz Perls (1893–1970). Clients are asked to address an emptychair as if speaking to somebody with whom they have some interpersonal difficulty. Theyare then asked to tell that person everything that they are feeling. In this way, they can fig-ure out what they are actually feeling, practice putting those feelings into words, andidentify the fears that keep them from communicating directly with the person in ques-tion. Interestingly, the empty chair technique has similarities with the behavioral tech-nique of systematic desensitization. By practicing a feared conversation without the actualperson present, the client is asked to confront something anxiety-provoking at a lowerlevel of anxiety. If the person can master the anxiety at that lower intensity, presumably heor she can move from there onto the more challenging situation. Hopefully, the personcan progress from talking to the empty chair to a conversation with the actual person.
What is family therapy?
The second half of the twentieth century was a time of considerable innovation inpsychotherapy and many new branches of psychotherapy broke off from their origin
389ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY: MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESSHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 389in traditional psychoanalysis. Family therapists challenged the emphasis on the indi-
vidual, a fundamental part of all earlier forms of psychotherapy. In family systemstheory, it is believed that families operate as systems and that no one member of thefamily can be understood in isolation from the other members of the family. This isparticularly true for married couples, or for children who live with and depend upontheir parents.
Although there are many strains of family therapy, including the structural family
therapy of Salvador Minuchin, the strategic family therapy of Jay Haley, and the expe-riential family therapy of Carl Whitaker and Virginia Satir, all family therapists believein bringing the entire family (or key members) into the room. By working with thefamily as a whole, therapists can achieve very different effects than can be accom-plished in individual therapy alone.
Family therapists address the patterns of interaction between family members.
Are the mother and the oldest child allying together against the father? Is the childacting out at school to force his estranged parents to talk to each other? Are the par-ents failing to set adequate boundaries with their children, giving the children toomuch power? Family therapy works by helping family members gain insight intotheir problematic patterns and then work together to change. Unlike psychodynamictherapy, family therapy addresses the present patterns of interaction with far lessemphasis on the past, although past history is recognized if it has contributed to pre-sent patterns.
390
The theory behind family therapy is that individuals do not operate in isolation but, instead, are part of a complex family system. It is
therefore important for the therapist to understand the entire family in order to treat one of its members ( iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 390Which therapies are best for which kinds of problems?
Although there is a fair amount of data that shows that the different types of therapy
are equally effective, research also suggests that certain kinds of psychotherapy arebest with specific psychological problems. Behavioral therapy is most effective foranxiety disorders such as phobias, panic disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder.Cognitive therapy is highly effective in mild to moderate depression. Impulsive andcompulsive behaviors, such as pathological gambling, self-injurious behaviors, andpoor anger management, respond well to skills-building therapies, using bothbehavioral and cognitive components.
People with mild to moderate personality disorders respond to long-term, insight-
oriented treatments, such as psychodynamic therapy, although people with severe per-sonality disorders may also need skills-building treatments. For example, dialecticalbehavioral therapy (DBT) is specifically designed to treat borderline personality disor-der. It is based on behavioral principles and makes use of functional behavioral analy-ses, but also addresses the poor emotional regulation and problematic interpersonalrelationships associated with this disorder.
How necessary is training in psychotherapy?
A number of studies suggest that patients are equally satisfied after talking to non-professionals as they are after talking to trained mental health professionals. Certainlywith short-term problems that are not particularly severe, many people can providereassurance and support without years of professional training. In order to help peoplewith more serious, complex, or entrenched problems, however, training is unques-tionably important. The 1995 Consumers Reports study showed that, in general, peo-
ple were happier and improved more from treatment with trained mental health pro-fessionals than from treatment with nonprofessionals. Moreover, the differencebetween the two grew the longer people stayed in treatment.
What factors matter most to the success of the therapy?
There is a large literature on the predictors to treatment outcome in psychotherapy, inother words, what factors contribute to the success or failure of psychotherapy. Boththerapist and patient factors contribute. Among therapist factors, personality variablessuch as genuineness and empathy (as perceived by the patient) are very important. Pos-itive expectations of therapy outcome are also important. If the therapist believes thatthe therapy can help, this contributes to a positive outcome. Among patient variables,motivation to change, hope, and positive expectations of the therapy promote positiveresults. General functioning level and degree of social support also contribute to thera-py outcome. Patients who function better in the world and have more supportive rela-tionships tend to do better in therapy. Many studies also stress the centrality of the
391ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY: MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESSHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 391therapeutic alliance. In other words, when both patient and therapist feel a positive
bond and have shared goals for therapy, the therapy is more likely to succeed.
What should someone look for in choosing a therapist?
Choosing a therapist is an important decision but there are no hard and fast rules forpicking a therapist that will best meet a patient’s needs. Because therapeutic allianceis such an important component of treatment outcome, it makes sense to pick a ther-apist with whom one feels comfortable. As in any relationship, this is to some extent apersonal decision. A therapist may provide a perfect fit for one person, but not click aswell with his or her friend. When seeking treatment for help with specific problems, italso makes sense to find someone with expertise in that area. As noted above, someproblems are best treated with specific types of therapy, for example, anxiety disordersrespond very well to behavioral therapy.
In many cases, however, the different types of therapy may be equally effective, so
the theoretical orientation of the therapist (for instance whether they are psychody-namic, humanistic, or cognitive-behavioral) may be mainly relevant in terms ofpatient-therapist fit. For example, people might consider whether they want a thera-pist who is directive (structures the treatment) or exploratory (promotes open-endeddiscussion), who does or does not give homework assignments, who talks a good dealor who is more interested in listening, who delves into childhood relationships or whofocuses on solving current problems, or who provides short-term or long-term psy-chotherapy (weeks to months vs. years).
The personality style of the therapist will also affect the type of therapy that is pro-
vided. Some therapists are gentle and supportive, while others tend more toward“tough love.” Some patients may prefer the first type of therapist, while others mayfind such a therapist too soft and prefer to be challenged.
How long should therapy last?
The different schools of therapy have different philosophies about the length oftherapy. Cognitive-behavioral therapies tend to be short term, while humanisticand psychodynamic therapies tend to be longer. Psychoanalysis often goes on formany years. Research suggests that minor and relatively recent problems may notrequire long-term treatment while more severe, complex and long lasting problemswill take more time. The length of the treatment also depends on the preferences ofthe patient.
Some patients are happy with resolution of the presenting symptom and choose
to stop treatment as soon as there is symptomatic improvement. Other patients areinterested in greater self-exploration and personality development, and stay in therapymuch longer. In the 1995 Consumer Reports study, patients who stayed in therapy
longer tended to be more satisfied with their treatment. Of course, this could reflect a
392Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 392selection bias because people who were more satisfied with their treatment may have
chosen to stay in therapy longer.
PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY
How have medications influenced the treatment of the mentally ill?
Modern advances in psychopharmacology (psychiatric medication) have radicallychanged the lives of the mentally ill. Once doomed to a life of anguish, utter dysfunc-tion, and often squalid conditions, many people with mental illness can now live satis-fying lives in the community. Although modern psychopharmacology has broughttremendous benefits, it is not without complications.
All medications have side effects, some of which can be quite dangerous. Secondly,
the drugs are only effective if they are taken as prescribed. Non-adherence to medica-tion is probably the single greatest reason for treatment failure. Finally, clinical trials(research into the efficacy and safety of certain medications) are extremely expensive.Because of this, they are currently covered primarily by private industry, specificallythe pharmaceutical industry, whose profit motive leaves them far from impartial. Con-sequently, some professionals and patients are concerned about the safety of takingmedications, especially for long periods of time.
What are the major classes of psychiatric drugs?
Although there are quite a few drugs that do not fit neatly into any one category, the maincategories of psychiatric drugs are antipsychotics, antidepressants, antianxiety drugs,
and mood stabilizers. For each class of drug, specific neurotransmitters are involved.
What are the antipsychotics and how do they work?
Antipsychotic drugs treat psychotic symptoms. These drugs are divided into two gen-eral categories, typicals and atypicals. Typicals date back to the early 1950s when
chlorpromazine (Thorazine) was developed in a Parisian laboratory. These medica-tions—which include such drugs as haloperidol (Haldol), thioridazine (Mellaril), andfluphenazine (Prolixin)—operate on the dopamine neurotransmitter system, specifi-cally on the D
2neurotransmitter receptors.
Typical antipsychotics are highly effective drugs, but have a range of problematic
side effects. Anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth, blurred vision, and confu-sion, are found in low potency typicals, such as chlorpromazine and thioridazine.Extra-pyramidal side effects (EPS) are more common in high-potency typicals, such ashaloperidol and fluphenazine. Symptoms of EPS include muscle tremors and stiffness.
393ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY: MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESSHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 393Atypical antipsychotics include risperidone (Risperdal), olanzapine (Zyprexa), que-
tiapine (Seroquel), ziprasidone (Geodon), and aripiprazole (Aricept). The atypicals
entered the market in the 1990s, although the first atypical, clozapine (Clozaril), wasintroduced considerably earlier but fell out of favor due to the risk of agranulocytosis,a potentially fatal disorder of the white blood cells. Atypicals work on a range of neuro-transmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. While atypicals areless likely to cause the kinds of side effects associated with typical antipsychotics, theybring their own side-effect profile. Most importantly, atypicals have a higher risk ofmetabolic syndrome, characterized by insulin resistance, high blood pressure, weightgain, and high blood sugar. Metabolic syndrome raises the risk of diabetes and heartdisease. With the advent of atypicals, clozapine received new attention. It is now con-sidered perhaps the most effective antipsychotic medication. Because of its side effectprofile, however, it is only used after other drugs have failed.
What are some commonly prescribed psychiatric drugs?
All drugs are given a generic name, which is a unique name for their chemical struc-ture, and a trade name, which is essentially a brand name. When the drug’s patentruns out, other manufacturers can produce the drug but only under its generic name.The table below lists commonly used drugs and their uses.

Zyprexa olanzepine antipsychotic mixed
Eskalith/Lithobid lithium mood stabilizer ?
Depakine valproic acid mood stabilizer GABA?
Neurotin gabapentin anticonvulsant/mood stabilizer GABA?
What is the CATIE study?
With the arrival of atypical antipsychotics, it was widely assumed that the new genera-tion of drugs was superior to the old generation. Not only did the atypicals have a more
394Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 394benign side effect profile than the typicals, atypicals were assumed to be more effective
in treating both the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. (Positive symp-toms refer to the active psychotic symptoms, and negative symptoms to the social with-drawal, reduced energy, and emotional flattening associated with schizophrenia.)
The CATIE study is a landmark study published in 2005 that challenged assumptions
about the superiority of atypicals over typicals. This study showed no difference in efficacybetween three atypical antipsychotic medications (quetiapine, risperidone, ziprasidone)and perphenizine (Trilafon), a mid-potency typical antipsychotic. While olanzapine(Zyprexa) proved superior to perphenizine, it also had the highest rates of metabolic sideeffects. Of note, this study was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, a gov-ernment institution. The study received no funding from pharmaceutical companies.
What are the antidepressants and how do they work?
Antidepressant medications treat depression. Currently, the most popular antidepres-sants are the serotonin repuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which work on the serotonin
neurotransmitter system. Commonly prescribed SSRIs include fluoxetine (Prozac),sertraline (Zoloft), citalopram (Celexa), and paroxetine (Paxil). SSRIs are very effectiveand safer than other classes of antidepressants but they do have side effects, the mostbothersome being sexual side effects. SSRIs are also helpful in the treatment of anxi-ety conditions and obsessive-compulsive disorder.
395ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY: MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESS
Although some psychologists are licensed to prescribe medications, psychiatrists or primary care doctors prescribe most psychia tric
drugs (iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 395Prior to the arrival of the SSRIs in the 1980s, heterocyclics were the most fre-
quently prescribed class of antidepressants. Commonly used heterocyclics include
imipramine (Tofranil), amitriptyline (Elavil), and nortriptyline (Pamelor). Hetero-cyclics, which get their name from the ring structure of the drugs’ molecules, hit boththe serotonin and norepinephrine neurotransmitter systems, with an emphasis onnorepinephrine. They also impact the histaminic and and acetylcholine neurotrans-mitter systems. Heterocyclics have more dangerous side effects than SSRIs. They aremore lethal on overdose and can have notable cardiac side effects.
Another class of antidepressants is monoamine oxydase inhibitors (MAOIs).
MAOIs were discovered in the early 1950s and their potentially lethal effects came tolight in the early 1960s. MAOIs can cause a hypertensive crisis, in which blood pres-sure shoots up high enough to cause a stroke.
These crises can be brought on by mixing an MAOI with another medication, such as
opioids or SSRIs, or by eating tyramine-rich foods. Aged cheese, cured meats, sausage,and liqueurs are all rich in tyramine. Although MAOIs are the most dangerous of the anti-depressants, they are also extremely effective. For those patients with treatment-resistantdepression who can follow a low tyramine diet, MAOIs may be a reasonable option. Exam-ples of MAOIs include phenelzine (Nardate) or tranylcypromine (Parnate).
What are the antianxiety drugs and how do they work?
There are at least two classes of antianxiety medications, barbituates and benzodi-
azepines. Both drug classes act on the GABA neurotransmitter system. Barbituates, suchas secobarbitol (Seconal) and pentobarbital (Nembutol), are the older class of drugs.Today, they are rarely prescribed as conventional antianxiety medications because of theirproblematic side-effect profile. Barbituates have a high risk of addiction and high lethalityon overdose. They also have cardiac effects at high doses and can dangerously depress res-piration (suppress breathing). Barbituates are still found to be useful in controlled set-tings, however, as when sedating a patient before an invasive procedure.
Benzodiazepines have largely taken the place of barbituates in the treatment of
anxiety. Medications such as alprazolam (Xanax), lorazepam (Ativan), clonazepam(Klonopin), and diazepam (Valium) have far lower risk of death on overdose and tend tobe less addictive than barbituates. Nonetheless, benzodiazepines can still be addictiveand abrupt discontinuation of the drug can put a person into withdrawal. The drug’shalf-life (amount of time needed for the drug to clear the body) influences the addictionpotential. Benzodiazepines with a short half-life, such as alprazolam, have higher riskof withdrawal and addiction than those with longer half-lives, such as clonazepam.
What are mood stabilizers?
Mood stabilizers help patients with bipolar disorder avoid the highs of mania and thelows of depression. They literally stabilize the mood. The most common mood stabi-
396Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 396lizers are lithium, valproic acid (Depakine), and carbamazepine (Tegretol). It remains
a bit of a mystery how mood stabilizers work. Unlike the other classes of psychiatricdrugs, mood stabilizers are not clearly linked to specific neurotransmitters. Somemood stabilizers alter the sodium channels in the cell membrane and some seem towork on the GABA neurotransmitter system. Most mood stabilizers also function asantiseizure medications (anticonvulsants), including carbamazepine and valproic acid.Additional antiseizure medications that are used to stabilize mood include gabapentin(Neurontin), lamotrogine (Lamictal), and topiramate (Topamax). Mood stabilizers alsotreat agitation and impulsivity.
Will drugs ever replace psychotherapy?
In the late 1980s during the explosive growth of the SSRIs, there was idle talk of drugsreplacing psychotherapy. Today, few people think that medications will ever replacepsychotherapy. Medications treat symptoms and they are enormously helpful with themost severe mental illnesses. However, they cannot replace the human element that isso central to the effectiveness of psychotherapy. Moreover, medications and psy-chotherapy treat different problems. Medications are extremely effective with psy-chosis, mania, severe depression, anxiety, and agitation. Alternatively, psychotherapyis effective with problematic personality traits, disturbed self-image, and impairedinterpersonal skills. Specific psychotherapies are also effective in the treatment of anx-iety disorders and mild to moderate depression. Although medications generally workmore quickly on depression and anxiety, psychotherapy tends to have more long-last-ing effects and certainly has fewer side effects.
How are new drugs developed?
The process of developing drugs and bringing them to market is long, complex, andexpensive. Basic biochemical research, which may take place in universities or in gov-ernment or industry laboratories, can suggest directions for drug development. Mostactual drug development takes place in industry laboratories, paid for by the extremelylarge and wealthy pharmaceutical industry. Once a drug is developed, it must be testedfor efficacy, safety, and tolerability. Efficacy reflects how well it treats the target symp-toms. Safety relates to the absence of dangerous side effects, otherwise known asadverse events. Tolerability reflects a patient’s ability to tolerate the drug. A drug maybe safe—that is not dangerous—but still intolerable. For example, it may cause nau-sea or headaches.
What are the stages of FDA testing?
In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires several phasesof testing before a drug can be FDA approved for the treatment of a particular condi-
tion. In Phase I studies, the drug must prove tolerable and safe in a small sample of
397ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY: MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESSHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 397healthy volunteers (twenty to eighty subjects). In Phase II studies, the drug must
prove tolerable and safe in a larger sample of patients (100 to 300 subjects) with someevidence of efficacy. In Phase II, the drug must show efficacy, tolerability, and safety ina larger sample of patients (1,000 to 3,000 subjects).
How do we know that a drug works?
The standard method for testing the efficacy of a new drug is through the use of ran-
domized controlled trials (RCTs). In an RCT, a large sample of patients are randomly
assigned to receive either the test treatment or a comparison treatment. The compari-son drug may be another active drug or may be a placebo (sham treatment that lookslike an active drug). Studies must also be double-blinded, that is neither doctor norpatient should be able to tell whether the patient is taking the drug or the placebo. Atthe end of a set period, symptom improvement is compared across groups. The efficacyof the drug reflects the improvement of symptoms in patients taking the active treat-ment, rather than the placebo.
Why are drugs compared to placebos?
Placebo controls are necessary because many patients improve just by suggestion. Theplacebo effect refers to the improvement seen in patients on placebo. It can be enor-
mously reassuring just to see a doctor and receive pills, even if there is no activeingredient in the pills. The placebo effect is a real phenomenon and can reach 30 to 40percent in some treatment studies. Therefore, it is necessary to include a placebo con-trol in a treatment study in order to prove that patient improvement is due to theactive ingredient in the drug and not just to the placebo effect.
398What psychiatric medications are
more likely to be abused?
Although psychiatric medications have been shown to be safe and tolerable inclinical trials and most have been used for years by many thousands of peo-
ple, some prescription drugs become drugs of abuse. Which medications aremost likely to be misused this way? Opiates and benzodiazepines are the classesof medications that are most likely to be abused. Antidepressants, antipsy-chotics, and mood stabilizers are less frequently abused. Data from the U.S. gov-ernment agency SAMHSA list sedatives, pain relievers, stimulants, and tranquil-izers as the most common candidates for prescription drug abuse. Drugs with aquick onset of action, a tendency to cause euphoric feelings, and a short half-lifeare more vulnerable to misuse.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 398How do we know which drugs work best?
FDA regulations ensure that each drug brought to market has shown safety and effica-
cy compared to a placebo or a comparison drug. FDA regulations do not require com-parisons among multiple drugs to determine which drug works best. Pharmaceuticalcompanies have financial incentives to show their own medications in the best light.Consequently, they have no incentive to spend millions of dollars on high quality,objective studies that could potentially reflect badly on their own product. It is nocoincidence, therefore, that the CATIE study, which punctured the illusion that neweris necessarily better, was financed by the National Institute of Mental Health and notby private industry. Clearly independent sources of funding are needed to support highquality and impartial drug-to-drug comparisons.
What impact does the pharmaceutical industry have on the practice
of psychiatry?
The pharmaceutical industry has had a profound effect on the practice of psychiatry.Ever since the 1980s, the U.S. government has moved more toward deregulation ofindustry. With this philosophical and political shift, the pharmaceutical industry hasgained more freedom to market directly to consumers and engage in joint researchwith academic centers.
Along with the tremendous advances in psychiatric medications, the pharmaceuti-
cal industry has grown extremely profitable and has become integrated into all aspectsof psychiatric research, publishing, and training. While there has been some reactionagainst this in recent years, the pharmaceutical industry still wields enormous influ-ence on prevailing opinion about which drugs are most useful for which conditions.
Unfortunately, there is little in the way of independent investigation, such as the
CATIE study, to give unbiased information about the relative effectiveness of differentmedications. This is not to suggest that clinical research sponsored by the pharmaceu-ticals is invalid, only that it is far from impartial and few companies are likely to pub-lish studies that might adversely affect their bottom line.
In his 2006 study by Robert Kelly and colleagues (see illustration), the authors
looked at 301 articles involving data on 542 drugs (many studies looked at the samedrugs). Whether the outcome of the study was favorable or not favorable for each drugwas recorded along with the source of research funding. As is shown above, for drugsin studies funded by the drug manufacturer, 78 percent of the studies showed favor-able results. For drugs in studies funded by the manufacturers’ competitors, only 28%of the studies had favorable outcomes. Finally, for drugs in studies that received nofunding from pharmaceutical companies, 48 percent of the outcomes were favorable.
In other words, when a drug company did not fund the study, the likelihood of a
positive outcome was about 50/50. In the other situations, however, it appears the dice
399ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY: MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESSHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 399were loaded. How does this happen? Does this mean that the research by pharmaceu-
tical companies is not valid? Most authors believe that the problem is less due to poorscience than to selective publication. Drug companies are more likely to publish stud-ies that support their product and less likely to publish studies that fail to do so.
What is E.C.T.?
ECT stands for electroconvulsive therapy, otherwise known as shock therapy . Elec-
trodes are placed at several locations on the skull and a small pulse of electricity issent through the electrodes into the brain. This causes a seizure, generally of twentyto thirty seconds in duration. Despite its scary reputation, ECT is very effective insevere depression. It is particularly effective in melancholic depression or depression
with a lot of neurovegetative symptoms. This refers to the physical symptoms of
depression, such as loss of energy, sleep and appetite disturbance, impaired concentra-tion, and physical slowing. The side effect profile of ECT is reasonable, especially ifdone infrequently. The most common side effect is loss of memory from around thetime of the treatments. ECT is frequently used in the elderly.
Why does E.C.T. have such a bad reputation?
Compared to many biological treatments used in psychiatry, ECT is quite old, datingback to the 1930s. Over its long history, the use of ECT has been considerably refined
400
Drug studies tend to show more favorable outcomes when research funding comes from the drug’s manufacturer.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 400and it is now used much more carefully than it was fifty years ago. In the past, ECT
was commonly used with a much wider range of disorders than it is now. Sometimesit was used simply for behavioral control. Today it is mainly used to treat depression,although it can also treat mania and psychosis.
Much higher dosages of electricity were used in the past than are used today.
Bilateral ECT, in which electrodes are placed on both sides of the head, was the norm,while unilateral ECT is frequently used today. Unilateral ECT tends to have fewer sideeffects though it is not as powerful as bilateral ECT.
Finally, muscle relaxants were not commonly used, so patients could get hurt
during seizures, even breaking bones. Currently, patients are given muscle relaxantsand put under general anaesthesia prior to ECT. When they wake up they have nomemory of the procedure. Additionally, electronic monitoring machines help ensurethat breathing and heartbeat remain normal throughout the procedure.
POPULAR PSYCHOLOGY
What is popular psychology ?
Popular or pop psychology is aimed at a popular audience and communicated through
the mass media. It addresses topics related to psychology—such as romantic relation-ships, stress management, child rearing, and sexuality—and can be found in magazinearticles, radio or television talk shows, popular books, and various Websites. The bene-fit of pop psychology is that it is accessible to a very wide audience and can be an effec-tive vehicle for translating psychological knowledge to the general public. The down-side is that there is little to no quality control. The information may or may not bebacked by solid psychological science or clinical experience.
What is the history of popular psychology ?
While the term “pop psychology” is relatively new, the concept is certainly not. As longas there have been human beings, there has been interest in human behavior. Alongwith this comes a pervasive desire to obtain advice from those who seem to knowmore about life’s challenges than the ordinary person. In ancient Greece, people con-sulted oracles for such advice. For many centuries, religious figures filled this func-tion, although soothsayers, fortune-tellers and other occult figures also came intoplay. In more recent times, advice columnists have made use of the mass media toprovide advice to the lovelorn, the depressed, or people who are otherwise troubled.Since the rise of the professional mental health fields, speakers with academic or med-ical credentials have gained in popularity. Unfortunately not all people in the popular
401ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY: MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESSHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 401psychology industry who present with medical or academic credentials actually have
training related to the topic they are discussing.
How do popular psychologists differ from licensed
professional psychologists ?
No credentials are necessary to become successful within the field of popular psychol-ogy. While licensed psychologists need to complete many years of rigorous trainingbefore they are legally able to call themselves a psychologist, a talk show host needonly master the (admittedly very difficult) art of popular entertainment before givingadvice to the general public. Some psychologists or mental health professionals doenter the field of popular psychology, but there is nothing stopping someone with adoctorate in French literature from using the appellation “Dr.” and appearing on adaytime pop psychology television show. Thus, much of popular psychology functionsmore as entertainment than as scientifically based psychological knowledge.
Who is Dr. Joyce Brothers?
Dr. Joyce Brothers (1929–) was one of the earliest popular psychologists, an actualpsychologist who brought her expertise to the general public through various mass-media outlets. She began her career on a television talk show in 1958, entitled Dr .Joyce Brothers. Over the next forty-five years, many other television and radio showsfollowed. She also wrote at least thirteen books with titles such as What Every WomanOught to Know about Love and Marriage and Dr. Brothers’ Guide to Your Emotions.
Dr. Brothers was trained as a psychologist, holds a Ph.D. in psychology from ColumbiaUniversity, and has been licensed in the state of New York since 1958.
Who are Ann Landers and Abigail Van Buren (Dear Abby)?
Ann Landers and Abigail Van Buren are the pen names of twin sisters who ended up asenormously successful advice columnists from the 1950s into the 1990s. Born in 1918in Iowa, neither sister had any formal training in psychology or a related field. Esther“Eppie” Friedman Lederer (1918–2002) assumed the Ann Landers advice column forthe Chicago Sun-Times in 1955. She continued until 1987, at which point she
switched to the Chicago Tribune. Married to a wealthy businessman named Jules Led-erer, who was also the founder of Budget-Rent-A-Car, she had amassed a wide range ofcontacts, which she mined for her column. Her plain-spoken, common sense adviceappealed to a great many people and her column was eventually syndicated to over1,000 newspapers. In 1956, her twin sister Pauline “Popo” Friedman Philips, began arival column, “Dear Abby”, in the San Francisco Chronicle under the pen name Abi-
gail Van Buren. Although neither sister had any training in the mental health field,they took care to clarify the limits of their knowledge and abilities, and often advised
402Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 402their readers to seek professional help if their problems seemed beyond the scope of a
newspaper advice column.
Who is Dr. Phil?
Phillip McGraw (1950–) is a widely known television personality, best known as Dr.Phil. He received a Ph.D. in clinical psychology from the University of North Texas in1979. Dr. Phil was licensed in Texas and opened a practice for a short while, but movedout of the business of psychotherapy into both popular and forensic psychology. In themid-1990s, he met the famous talk show host Oprah Winfrey through his work inforensic psychology, a branch of psychology involved with the legal system. He washired to help with her defense against a lawsuit by cattlemen who claimed she defamedthe beef industry on one of her shows. Soon he was appearing regularly on her televi-sion show. In 2002 he started his own talk show, which was named Dr . Phil. While stillliving in Texas, Dr. Phil allowed his psychology license to lapse. When he moved to Cal-ifornia to pursue his television career, he did not obtain a license in California as thestate licensing board determined that his show was more entertainment than psycholo-gy and, therefore, his current practice did not require that he be licensed.
Who is Dr. Laura?
Dr. Laura is another popular media personality. She works primarily in radio but hasalso published a number of books. Laura Schlessinger (1947–) has a doctorate in phys-iology from Columbia University but also obtained a post-doctoral certificate in Mar-riage, Child, and Family Counseling from the University of Southern California. Shestates she was in private practice for twelve years. Dr. Laura is known for her sociallyconservative views and for combining moral, religious, and mental health considera-tions into her responses to viewers. This departs from the official practice of profes-sional psychologists, who must distinguish between their personal and professionalviews when dealing with patients.

IMPACT OF TRAUMA
What is psychological trauma ?
Psychological trauma refers to any event that threatens extreme psychological or
physical damage, including severe bodily harm or death. Traumatic events evoke feel-ings of terror, horror, and helplessness. A traumatic event can involve direct threat tothe self, but people can also feel traumatized after witnessing harm or threat of harmto someone else. Traumas can include natural disasters, such as an earthquake, tsuna-mi, or hurricane, but traumas can also stem from human behavior, as with war,assault, or rape.
Why do we study trauma?
Ever since the first psychoanalytic case histories of the late nineteenth century, it hasbeen recognized that severe trauma can have long-lasting impact on psychologicalfunctioning. An enormous body of research shows us that trauma can cause severepsychological distress and that a history of trauma is a risk factor for a very broadrange of psychiatric and psychological disturbances.
What kinds of psychological problems are associated with trauma?
It is important to distinguish between acute trauma in adulthood, such as a naturaldisaster or an assault, and chronic trauma that occurs in childhood, such as ongoingsexual or physical abuse. Trauma in general has been associated with anxiety, depres-sion, increased drinking, anger outbursts, suicidal behavior, and a syndrome known as
405
THE 
PSYCHOLOGY OF TRAUMAHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 405post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). While personality in adulthood is largely
formed, personality is still developing in childhood. Thus, chronic trauma in child-
hood can have extremely pervasive and long-term effects on personality development.
People with histories of serious childhood abuse can develop severe personality
disorders. They can also develop self-injurious behaviors, in which they may cut orburn themselves. Dissociative symptoms are also fairly common. These involve feel-ings of unreality and disconnection from mental and physical experience. There is astriking lack of awareness of certain feelings, thoughts, or actions. In extreme cases,people might develop dissociative identity disorder (previously known as multiple per-sonality disorder), in which they literally believe that they have several different per-sonalities within their own body.
How did Freud’s seduction theory account for the childhood trauma?
Sigmund Freud’s early work on the seduction theory set the stage for many of the
later developments in trauma psychology. Freud was initially interested in the prob-lem of hysteria, which was a fairly common disorder in Victorian Europe. Peoplewould complain of various bodily problems that had no basis in actual physiology. Wewould now diagnose such complaints as conversion disorders. After interviewingnumerous patients, Freud came up with the seduction theory, which stated that hyste-ria was caused by seduction in early life. In other words, hysteria stemmed from earlyexperiences of childhood sexual abuse.
Within a few years, Freud abandoned this theory, believing that hysteria was too com-
mon to have been solely caused by sexual abuse. This would have meant that far morechildren were sexually abused than he believed was likely. He replaced his focus on actualexperience with an emphasis on fantasy. The child may not have actually been seduced,but instead had repressed fantasies of seduction by the mother or father. With this turnfrom actual traumatic events to traumatic fantasies, the study of childhood trauma wentunderground for more than half a century, not to re-emerge until the 1970s and 1980s.
What role did war play in the development of trauma studies?
Although Freud’s abandonment of the seduction theory turned the budding mentalhealth field away from the psychological effects of trauma, returning soldiers fromWorld War I brought attention right back to the effects of trauma. The war wastremendously traumatic. Young men were sent away from home and exposed to theconstant threat of their own death and to the violent and bloody death of their com-rades. They were also forced to perform violent and murderous acts themselves, some-times against civilians.
Many soldiers returning from WWI exhibited the emotional distress we now know
as post-traumatic stress disorder. At the time it was known as “shell shock.” But there
406Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 406was little validation of these soldiers’ suffering at the time, and it was often seen as a
sign of moral weakness. In World War II, the problem recurred (sometimes referred toas “battle fatigue”) and there was some progress in the study, treatment, and recogni-tion of post-traumatic psychopathology.
It was not until the Vietnam War, however, that the mental health field truly mobi-
lized to study and develop treatments for the emotional aftereffects of trauma. In 1980,five years after the end of the Vietnam War, the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disor-der was published in DSM-III. (The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) is the offi-cial diagnostic manual for the mental health field. DSM-III was the third edition.)
What is post-traumatic stress disorder?
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a particular condition that follows experienceof a severe trauma. There are three clusters of symptoms: persistent avoidance ofreminders of the event (numbing symptoms), persistent re-experiencing of the event(intrusive symptoms ), and autonomic hyperarousal . With numbing symptoms, there
is a blunting of emotional reactivity. There is flat affect, avoidance of various activities,loss of memory for traumatic events, and lack of motivation or interest in activitiesthat used to engage the person. With intrusive symptoms, the opposite happens.Instead of a lack of memory for the traumatic events, there is a flood of memories thatcannot be turned off. There may be nightmares or flashbacks, in which the traumareturns as if it is happening all over again. There may also be intrusive emotionalstorms, such as crying spells, rage outbursts, or panic attacks. With autonomic hyper-arousal, the autonomic nervous system is on overdrive. The body is continually onguard, ready to spring into action at any sign of danger. There can be an exaggeratedstartle response, difficulty concentrating and difficulty sleeping, as well as rapid heart-beat, sweating, and continued muscle tension.
What factors in the event increase the risk of getting PTSD?
Not everyone will get PTSD after a trauma. There are many different kinds of traumas,and different people respond to the same event in different ways. A number of factorswithin the trauma affect the risk of developing PTSD. Whether the trauma was naturalor man-made, and whether the human-induced trauma was accidental (e.g., a car acci-dent) or intentional (e.g., a mugging) all affect a person’s response. The more intention-al, the more disturbing. Naturally the severity of the trauma is very important. Howmuch danger was involved? How much physical pain was suffered? How much violence?Did anyone die? All these questions influence the impact of the trauma. The duration ofthe trauma is important as well—was it quick or did it last over time? Whether the trau-ma was a one-time event or ongoing (e.g., a mugging vs. a war) also factors in. Longer,more chronic, more severe, and intentionally malicious traumas cause greater psycho-logical damage than shorter, milder, single-episode, and unintentional traumas.
407THE PSYCHOLOGY OF TRAUMAHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 407How does the emotional impact of
human traumas differ from that of
natural disasters?
While a natural disaster such as Hurricane
Katrina or the tsunami of 2004 can haveprofound emotional impact on the sur-vivors, there is a uniquely destructiveeffect from trauma that is caused by otherpeople, specifically if there was intentionto cause harm. We are profoundly socialanimals and a good deal of our psychologyis devoted to the negotiation of interper-sonal relationships. If we suffer significantharm at the hands of another person, thatcan throw our entire worldview intodoubt. Are people still good? Can otherpeople be trusted? While the loss of a senseof safety regarding our physical surround-ings can be enormously frightening, we donot expect morality from the weather. Anatural disaster does not in itself threaten
our fundamental belief in the decency of humanity. When people lose trust in other peo-ple, they can suffer from deep depression and social alienation.
What factors in a person increase the risk of PTSD?
Not all people are equally traumatized by the same incident. What kinds of personalfactors influence the risk of developing PTSD? Research suggests that people with aprevious history of trauma, those with pre-existing psychiatric problems or personali-ty disorders, those with less social support, and those with an external locus of controlare more likely to develop PTSD in response to a traumatic event. People with anexternal locus of control believe that outside forces determine the events in their life.They do not believe they have much control over their life. In contrast, people with aninternal locus of control believe they have significant control over their life. They tend
to be more optimistic and more proactive about solving problems. Finally, people whoreact with dissociation at the time of event are shown to be likely to develop PTSD.
What are the biological effects of trauma?
Trauma has considerable impact on our neurobiology, and there are actual physiologi-cal changes that can accompany trauma. To start with, trauma involves an intenseactivation of our stress response. The HPA axis (hypothalamus, pituitary gland, adren-
408
Although living through a natural disaster, such as a fire or
earthquake, can result in emotional trauma, trauma that isinflicted by other people is much worse emotionally ( iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 408al gland) mediates our brain’s stress response. In the face of stress, the HPA axis is
activated. It sends out stress hormones, known as glucocorticoids. These serve to acti-vate the autonomous nervous system, making our heart pump faster, our breath morerapid and shallow, and blood rush to our large muscle groups from our small musclegroups. This allows our body to respond rapidly to threat.
In normal circumstances, our parasympathetic nervous system acts to restore
this system to a resting state, allowing our body to recover from the stress reaction.However, with trauma, the whole stress system can be thrown out of whack, causingabnormalities within the HPA axis, and keeping our autonomic nervous system(specifically the sympathetic nervous system ) on overdrive. This has the effect of
wearing down the body, compromising the immune system, and putting undue stresson many parts of the body’s regulating systems. In childhood when the brain is notfully developed, severe trauma can interfere with the brain’s actual development, caus-ing long-term damage.
What is dissociation?
Dissociation involves an alteration in attention and awareness. People cut off aware-
ness of feelings, thoughts, or even memories of actual events. Sometimes peopleremember all of the events but feel entirely emotionally detached from the memories.Alternatively, they may feel detached from personal experience, as if they are not a realperson, but a robot. This is called depersonalization. Derealization occurs when peo-
ple feel that the world around them is not real. Dissociation is similar to a trancestate, which is an altered state of consciousness in which awareness of the surround-ing world is changed.
Dissociation is fairly common among people who have undergone trauma and it
serves to protect the person from becoming overwhelmed by intolerable emotions.During the trauma, some people remember slipping into dissociative states. “Thatwasn’t me down there on the bed. I was floating somewhere up on the ceiling.”Although dissociation may help people survive trauma, dissociative symptoms cancause problems after the trauma is over, interfering with the person’s ability toprocess the trauma and return to normal life.
Are traumatic memories really repressed?
There has been a good deal of controversy over the issue of repressed memories.Many researchers and clinicians have written about patients who lost access to theirmemories of abuse, only to recover them years later. Often the recovery of memoriesis associated with a surge of intrusive post-traumatic symptoms, such as nightmares,emotional outbursts, and even suicidality. In the 1980s and 1990s this concern withrepressed memories of trauma exploded into a hysterical craze in which accusationsflew and innocent people were charged with crimes that were suddenly “remem-
409THE PSYCHOLOGY OF TRAUMAHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 409bered” in psychotherapy. Partly in response to this excess, there are factions within
the mental health field that discount the possibility of recovered memories at all.Professionals who work with adult survivors of childhood trauma, however, oftenencounter patients who recover childhood memories long after the traumatic eventshave occurred.
Can false memories be suggested to people?
Elizabeth Loftus (1944–) is a researcher who has long studied the vagaries of memory.She became well known for challenging the idea of recovered memories. Her workshowed that memory is extremely malleable, that people are highly suggestible, andthat false memories can be implanted by suggestion. In other words, it doesn’t takethat much to convince people that they remember things that never actually hap-pened. Loftus’s work highlights the risk of eliciting recovered memories of childhoodtrauma in psychotherapy. Clinicians must tread very carefully with patients whomthey suspect may have histories of abuse. Clinicians must take pains to avoid leadingquestions and always keep in mind that the absence of memory may simply mean theabsence of abuse.
How do we treat the effects of trauma?
For the most part, the aftereffects of trauma are treated by psychotherapy, althoughthe acute symptoms of PTSD may be treated by antianxiety or antidepressant medica-tion. Immediately after an acute trauma, people need help in reducing their autonom-ic arousal. In other words, they need help calming down. They need to be assured thatthey are safe and that it is safe to let down their guard. Social support is also extremelyimportant at all points of the recovery process, and groups who undergo traumastogether often form very strong bonds.
After the immediate crisis has passed, it is helpful for people to discuss what hap-
pened, particularly to share their experiences with other people who have experiencedthe same trauma. This is where support groups or informal debriefings can be helpful.If symptoms of PTSD develop, individual therapy with cognitive-behavioral techniquescan help reduce symptoms. Relaxation techniques can reduce the autonomic hyper-arousal, gradual desensitization can help people overcome tendencies to avoid anyreminder of the trauma, and psychoeducation can help people make sense of theirreactions to the trauma. Distorted cognitions about the trauma should also beaddressed, particularly excessive self-blame.
Self-blame is a common reaction to trauma as it serves to combat the extreme sense
of helplessness. “If it was my fault, I’m not helpless.” Likewise, people do need to feelempowered, and constructive actions that grant some sense of control should be encour-aged. For example, letter writing to newspapers or government officials, public speakingabout the event, and commemoration rituals can all help people feel empowered.
410Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 410Is long-term childhood trauma treated differently than acute trauma
in adulthood?
With more chronic, childhood trauma, the therapy takes more time and needs to
move more slowly. The therapy should first address any severe problems with func-tioning, such as self-mutilation, suicidality, and severe personality pathology. Onlywhen the patient can tolerate talking about the trauma without becoming over-whelmed by painful emotion or developing dangerous symptoms, should the therapyaddress the trauma directly. With some people this can happen fairly quickly, withothers it might take years. Some people with very fragile emotional and behavioralcontrol may never fully process the trauma. Instead, the therapy will focus on shoringup self-control capacities and the general ability to function.
CHILD ABUSE
What is child abuse and why is it so important in psychology?
While trauma is defined as any terrifying, life-threatening event, child abuse has amore specific meaning, referring to the maltreatment of a dependent child. Maltreat-ment can range from failure to attend to the child’s fundamental needs to intentional-ly inflicting harm. Such harm could include violent attacks or sexual molestation.Child maltreatment is generally divided into four categories: neglect, emotional or
psychological abuse, physical abuse, and sexual abuse. Child maltreatment hasreceived a good deal of attention within the field of psychology because of its extreme-ly damaging and far-reaching effects—child abuse leaves its mark on almost allaspects of psychological functioning.
How common is child abuse?
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services compiles statistics on cases ofchild maltreatment that are reported to the authorities. According to these statistics,in 2007, there were almost 800,000 incidents of child maltreatment in the UnitedStates. Over half the reports involved neglect, 13 percent multiple forms of abuse, 10.8percent physical abuse, and 7.6 percent sexual abuse. Of course this includes only thecases that were reported. We can assume that the real incidence of abuse is far higher.
What kinds of abuse do children suffer?
As you can see from the table below, child neglect is the most common type of childmistreatment that comes to the attention of the authorities. These statistics come fromthe 2007 report on Child Mistreatment by the U.S. Department of Health and Human
411THE PSYCHOLOGY OF TRAUMAHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 411Services. While psychological abuse is listed as the second least common type of abuse
reported to the authorities, this probably has little relationship to its frequency in the
population. We can presume it is one of the most common forms of abuse, but becauseit does not put the child in immediate physical danger, it is likely underreported.

Who commits child abuse ?
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2007 statistics, par-
ents were the most frequent perpetrators of child abuse in the cases reported to theauthorities. The mother was the perpetrator in 38.7 percent of the cases, and themother plus another person in 5.7 percent of the cases. The father was the perpetratorin 17.9 percent of the cases, the father plus another person in 0.9 percent of the cases,and the mother and father together in 16.8 percent of the cases. Day care staffaccounted for 0.5 percent of the cases, friend/neighbors 0.4 percent, female relatives1.7 percent, and male relatives 3.1 percent. Unrelated romantic partners of the parentsalso accounted for a small percent of the cases reported. Male partners accounted for2.3 percent and female partners 1.7 percent.
What are the aftereffects of child abuse ?
As noted above, trauma in childhood differs from trauma in adulthood. While adultshave largely formed personalities, children’s psychological capacities are not yet fullydeveloped. Child abuse interferes with the child’s psychological development, stuntingor distorting the child’s growing ability to regulate emotion, control impulses, plan andfollow through with goals, negotiate interpersonal relationships, and maintain a stableand positive self-image. Abused children are also more likely to have difficulties withpeer relationships and academic performance, and even suffer more medical problemsthan children who have not been abused. Consequently, child abuse raises the risk ofanxiety, depression, impulse control disorders, and severe personality pathologythroughout the lifespan. Most tragically, the abuse can teach the child that the world iscruel and uncaring, and that the child is unworthy of love, protection, or respect.
412Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 412What are the neurobiological effects of childhood trauma ?
In the developing child’s brain, trauma can affect the very structure of the brain cells.
Trauma can hinder mylenation, the growth of a fatty insulation around the neuron’s
axon. Myelin improves the speed of electrical impulses travelling across the neuron.Trauma can also hinder synaptogenesis, the formation of connections between cells as
well as the morphology or shape of the cell itself. Altogether, this reduces the density
and connectivity of the brain. Moreover, brain cells are damaged in areas of the braininvolved with emotion, memory, and behavioral control. Such areas include the amyg-dala, the hippocampus, and the frontal lobe.
What is complex PTSD?
Complex PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) pertains to the long-term effects ofchronic and severe child abuse. This is quite different from normal PTSD, whichdescribes the effects of acute trauma in adulthood. In complex PTSD, there are long-term changes in attention, memory, consciousness, regulation of emotion, and per-sonality characteristics, including unstable, distorted and negative self-perceptions,and problematic interpersonal relationships. These problems can result in the dissoci-ation, self-mutilation, self-destructive behaviors, and emotional storms that are oftenfound with survivors of severe childhood abuse. While chronic PTSD is not an officialdiagnosis, it is currently being evaluated for inclusion in future editions of the Diag-nostic and Statistical Manual (DSM).
What factors increase the long-term damage of child abuse?
Not everyone who has survived child abuse suffers the same results. Many factorsaffect the outcome. The first factor is the severity of the abuse. Violent, cruel, frequentand long-lasting abuse obviously has more of an effect than milder abuse. The rela-tionship with the perpetrator is also critically important. The greater the emotionaldependence on the perpetrator and the closer the relationship, the greater the dam-age. Consequently, abusive mothers do the most damage, followed by abusive fathers,other relatives, friends, acquaintances, and then strangers.
What percentage of children in the United States are abused in some way?
The table below shows the breakdown by age and sex of the total number of victimizedchildren in the United States. As the table shows, most of the mistreatment casesoccur with children under the age of four (60.2 percent of boys and 58.1 percent ofgirls). Most of these cases involve neglect. After age four the incidence of mistreat-ment goes down, only to rise again in adolescence for girls, but not boys. The increasein the mistreatment of teenage girls is probably due to an increase in sexual assaults
413THE PSYCHOLOGY OF TRAUMAHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 413starting at that time. These statistics come from the 2007 report on Child Mistreat-
ment by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

among different age groups?
This table shows the frequency of different types of abuse across different age groups.For example, 21.8 percent of the total number of mistreatment cases involve neglectof children under the age of four. As you can see, neglect becomes less common aschildren get older, while sexual abuse becomes more common. All types of abusedecrease by the late teens. These statistics come from the 2007 report on Child Mis-treatment by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Psychological Abuse 1.14 1.05 0.95 0.78 0.22Sexual Abuse 0.48 1.8 1.8 2.7 0.8
What is the generational cycle of abuse?
Tragically, child abuse is often passed down from generation to generation. Frequently
the parents of abused children have a history of child abuse in their own families. It isif they have learned automatically to treat children the way they have been treated. Itis important to note, however, that the majority of abused children do not grow up toabuse their own children. Moreover, several factors buffer the effect of childhood
414Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 414abuse. For example, victims of child
abuse with greater levels of education,social support, and financial security areless likely to abuse their own children.
What factors protect against the
after effects of child abuse ?
A warm, close relationship with an alter-native caretaker, such as an aunt, grand-parent, or even a caring neighbor, cansoften the damaging effects of childabuse. Likewise, if the abuse is addressedpromptly and the child protected fromfurther harm, this can do a good deal torestore the child’s faith in the world. Thisis simplest if the abuser is not a closefamily member. However, if the child is strongly attached to the abuser—for example,if the abuser is a parent—separation from the abuser can also bring tremendous feel-ings of loss.
Psychotherapy can help the child victim understand what happened to him or her,
correct any distorted views of the abuse (such as self-blame), and work through thecomplex and sometimes contradictory feelings about the abuse and the abuser. Hope-fully, such help can protect against some of the negative psychological effects thatoften follow experiences of child abuse. Further, connections with institutions thatfoster relationships with the larger community (e.g., school, church), appropriate dis-cipline in the home, and family stability protect against the negative psychologicaleffects of child abuse.
What do we know about resilient children?
As mentioned above, not all survivors of child abuse develop severe psychopathology.In fact, there are estimates that as much as one-third of children from abusive back-grounds grow up to be reasonably healthy and well-adjusted adults. Such children areconsidered resilient, which means they can bounce back and develop well even in the
face of tremendous stress. Research has found several factors are associated withresilience in children: intelligence; the ability to make emotional connections withpeople outside the family; moderate self-control; positive self-image; and an internallocus of control all promote resilience. People with an internal locus of control believethey have reasonable control over their environment and that their actions make a dif-ference. In addition, resilient survivors of child abuse are less likely than their lessresilient counterparts to blame themselves for the abuse.
415THE PSYCHOLOGY OF TRAUMA
Child abuse is often passed down generation to generation,
but the cycle can be broken. The majority of child abuse
victims do not grow up to be abusers themselves ( iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 415SEXUAL ABUSE
What is sexual abuse?
Sexual abuse of children involves inappropriate sexual contact between a child and an
adult or a much older child. According to a definition used by Joan Liem, JacquelineJames, and colleagues in a 1997 study, sexual abuse involves any form of coercive sex-ual contact with an under-age child or any sexual contact between a child thirteenyears or younger and someone five or more years older. Although the exact statutesvary state by state, any adult sexual contact with an under-age child is against the law.Sexual abuse ranges from exposure of genitals to fondling of body parts to direct geni-tal contact and, ultimately, to anal or vaginal intercourse. Arguably, sexual abuse maybe the most psychologically damaging form of child abuse.
Is sexual abuse violent?
The vast majority of incidents of child molestation are not violent. Most child moles-ters use manipulation or seduction to gain access to their child victims. A sizeablenumber of child molesters use just enough force to accomplish their goal. Only asmall percentage is truly violent. These extreme cases attract the most media atten-tion, however, which unfortunately gives the public a distorted sense of the problem ofchild sexual abuse.
Who are the victims of child sexual abuse?
According to government statistics, adolescent girls are the most common victims ofchild sexual abuse. Sexual abuse of pre-pubescent boys and girls is still widespread,however. In 2007, according to the U.S. Department of Health, there were approxi-mately 56,460 cases of child sexual abuse reported to the authorities, 30,160 (53 per-cent) involved children under the age of twelve. Most children are abused by someonethey know, 34.2 percent by family members, 58.7 percent by friends or acquaintances,and 7.0 percent by strangers, according to FBI statistics.
What are the effects of childhood sexual abuse ?
Although there is a wide range of psychological responses to childhood sexual abuse,problems with low self-esteem, depression, dissociation, lack of trust, and strong feel-ings of shame are very common. In fact, the diagnosis of complex PTSD was developedlargely out of the study of sexual abuse survivors. Borderline personality disorder isalso strongly linked to child sexual abuse. Not surprisingly, many sexual abuse sur-vivors also have disturbances in their sexual functioning as adults. Some survivorsbecome over-controlled sexually, with intense fear of and aversion to sexual contact.
416Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 416Others go to the opposite extreme and become sexually promiscuous, engaging in
compulsive, driven, and often reckless sexual behavior. A 2008 study by Beth Brodskyand colleagues showed that the effects of child sexual abuse can reach across genera-tions. Children of mothers who were sexually abused as children had an increased rateof suicidal tendencies compared to children of non-abused mothers.
Is sexual abuse transmitted across generations?
Like many forms of child abuse, sexual abuse can be transmitted across generations.Adults who were abused as children can grow up to either abuse their own children orpartner with someone who will abuse the children. Again, this is not to say that allchildhood sexual abuse victims will grow up to abuse their own children. A large pro-portion of people who were sexually abused in childhood do not pass on their abuseexperiences to their own children. Nonetheless, parents of abused children are morelikely to have their own abuse histories than are parents of non-abused children.
How does incest differ from other kinds of sexual abuse?
According to FBI statistics, about 34 percent of child abuse cases involve incest. Inces-tuous abuse occurs when the child is related to the sexual abuser. Victims of incestu-ous abuse tend to experience more frequent, invasive, and long-term sexual abuse asthe perpetrator has ongoing and convenient access to the victim. Research suggeststhat, on the whole, incest victims suffer greater psychological damage than do victimsof other types of child sexual abuse. Not only is the child affected by the sexual abuseitself, the child’s entire view of interpersonal relationships is distorted by the incestu-ous relationship. Particularly when children are abused by a parent or a close caretak-er, their ability to trust, to believe themselves worthy of care, and to value or even rec-ognize their own needs and boundaries can be profoundly damaged. The abuser is notacting as a caretaker but as a user and exploiter of the child. In this context, it is oftendifficult for the child to understand that this is neither normal nor acceptable and thatit is the adult who is at fault, not the child.
What is pedophilia?
Pedophilia is a psychiatric disorder characterized by persistent sexual attraction to pre-pubescent children. Not all child molesters are pedophiles, however. For example, somechild molesters sexually assault children not because they are sexually attracted to chil-dren, but because the child is a convenient target, because they are intoxicated, or forsome other reason. Further, not all pedophiles are child molesters. Some people withstrong and persistent sexual attraction to children may never act on their urges. Addi-tionally, adults who molest adolescents are not necessarily pedophiles, as pedophiliarefers only to the attraction to pre-pubescent children. The term hebephile is some-
times used to describe adults who are attracted to adolescents.
417THE PSYCHOLOGY OF TRAUMAHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 417Are there different kinds of pedophilia?
There have been several categorizations of pedophilia, but perhaps the most useful
involves the distinction between true pedophiles and opportunistic pedophiles. Simi-lar terms include fixated vs. regressed pedophiles and preferential vs. situationalpedophiles. True pedophiles have persistent sexual attraction to pre-pubescent chil-dren. Opportunistic pedophiles have less of a focused sexual attraction to children.Their sexual engagement with children may depend on circumstances, such as theconvenient availability of a child victim, loss of normal inhibitions due to substanceabuse, or difficulty feeling comfortable with an adult sexual partner. In this way,opportunistic pedophiles may overlap with non-pedophilic child molesters.
What causes pedophilia?
At this point, there is no clear answer to this question, although quite a few possiblecauses have been proposed. Three possible causes include inadequate social skills,neurological impairment (or brain damage), and the pedophile’s own history of child-hood sexual abuse.
Do pedophiles lack mature social skills?
Researchers and clinicians have suggested that pedophiles have poor self-esteem andinadequate social skills and turn to children out of fear of pursuing adult relationships.While this may be true for some pedophiles, it is clearly not true for many others, as therehave been many high functioning, socially competent, and even married pedophiles.
Is pedophilia caused by neurological damage ?
There is also research suggesting that pedophiles suffer from some sort of neurologicaldisturbance or brain damage. Again, there is some evidence of this. Several brain imag-ing studies have suggested abnormal brain function. There have also been cases of peo-ple developing pedophilia after suffering brain damage. However, this research is com-plicated by the samples used in pedophile studies. Most studies obtain their subjectsfrom the criminal justice system. In other words, we study the ones who get caught. Werarely study the ones who have never been caught or have never acted on their urges.We know that, on the whole, convicted criminals tend to have lower intelligence, moreproblems with impulse control, and higher levels of psychopathic personality traits thanthe general population. Therefore, it is not clear if the biological findings are related topedophilia per se, or to other problems common with a criminal population.
Were pedophiles sexually abused as children?
There does seem to be a clear relationship between sexual abuse in childhood andthe development of pedophilia in adulthood. Many studies have shown a much
418Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 418higher rate of childhood sexual abuse in pedophilic samples than in the general
population. Moreover, pedophiles have a higher rate of childhood sexual abuse thando non-sexual criminals and even sexual offenders against adults. As we are learn-ing more and more about how early trauma affects the brain, it is possible that earlysexual abuse disturbs the parts of the brain that regulate sexuality, contributing tothe later development of pedophilia in some victims.
What are the signs that a child has been sexually abused?
Children frequently do not tell anyone that they are being sexually abused. Even if thechild has a close and trusting relationship with a parent and the abuse is by someoneoutside the family, the child may keep the abuse a secret out of shame, confusion, fearof retribution by the abuser or, if the child is young enough, lack of understandingabout what is happening. In these cases, clues may be found in the behavior of thechild. There may be a marked change in the child’s behavior, including a sudden onsetof anxiety, depression, social withdrawal, reduced self-esteem, or sleep disturbances. Apreviously well-adjusted child may suddenly start acting truant, perform poorly inschool or lose, or gain a good deal of weight. Unusual or predatory sexual behavior inthe child can be another clue that the child has experienced sexual abuse. A suddenfear or aversion to a particular adult may also be a clue. Of course, behavioral changeslike these can be due to many other causes besides sexual abuse. There is no need toassume a child who has developed some emotional problems has necessarily been sex-ually abused. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that children cannot alwaysverbalize that they have been abused and may express their suffering through markedchanges in their behavior.
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
What is domestic violence?
Domestic violence refers to any kind of violence between intimate (or romantic) part-ners. Generally this refers to a husband and wife, but it can also apply to unmarried cou-ples that do or do not live together. Domestic violence can also occur between homosex-ual couples, either gay men or lesbians. The severity of violence can range from mildaggression, such as a slap or a shove, to severe aggression (punching, kicking), toextreme aggression (long assaults, burning, or breaking bones), and even to murder.
What is the difference between domestic violence and wife battering?
Domestic violence is a very general term that does not specify the perpetrator, theseverity of violence, or the duration of violence. Wife battering is a more specific term
419THE PSYCHOLOGY OF TRAUMAHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 419and refers to a systematic pattern of intimidation, control, terror, and physical vio-
lence inflicted upon a woman by her male partner. The intent of such behavior is togain total control over the woman.
What is the history of attitudes toward domestic violence?
The problem of violence between people in intimate relationships has received shock-ingly little attention until quite recently. As part of the wave of civil rights movementsstarting in the 1960s, feminism brought attention to the profound problem of batteredwomen, and the disturbing neglect that society has shown the victims. Severalresearchers and activists interviewed dozens, if not hundreds, of women who told dra-matic stories about years of violence and abuse that were minimized, rationalized, anddismissed by the larger society. Police would brush off domestic violence as a privatefamily matter, the clergy would emphasize the need to keep the family together overthe women’s safety, and the courts would fail to prosecute the cases. Starting in the1970s, a movement began to bring attention to the profoundly destructive effect ofdomestic violence and wife battering. Shelters for battered women were set up, newlaws were written, and police, clergy and other authorities were educated about theseriousness of the problem.
What role did feminism play in the understanding of domestic violence?
The feminist movement played a central role in developing awareness of domestic vio-lence. Feminist writers were the first to describe in detail the psychological, physical,economic, and cultural aspects of wife battering and to insist on bringing public atten-tion to the problem. But as the feminist movement was essentially a political move-ment, the approach to domestic violence emphasized the political roots of the wife bat-tering. More specifically, wife battering was seen as an outgrowth of the larger societaloppression of women. In a patriarchal (male dominated) society, women were seen asproperty and wife battering a quasi-legitimate means to keep women under control.
How has the study of domestic violence changed from the early
feminist approach?
More recent work has taken a broader approach to the problem of domestic violencethan was taken by the initial feminist writers. There is greater emphasis on empiricalresearch instead of open-ended interviews and clinical histories. There is also interestin same-sex violence, the impact of domestic violence on children, the psychologicalfeatures of anyone engaging in intimate partner violence, and the role of female-initi-ated violence. Importantly, empirical research has shown that not all of domestic vio-lence can be explained by patriarchal oppression of women. Although classic instancesof wife battering certainly do occur, women themselves are not always helpless victims
420Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 420of an abusive partner. Sometimes women are violent themselves and/or display some
of the psychologically abusive tactics of a classic batterer. Additionally, violencebetween same-sex couples cannot easily be explained by societal oppression of women.Nonetheless, although later research shows a more complex picture than the earlierfeminists described, the nature and frequency of domestic violence is undeniablyinfluenced by the cultural, economic, and legal position of women in society.
What are some of the key concepts of the battering syndrome?
Even though the study of domestic violence has broadened beyond the political van-tage point of the 1970s, several key ideas introduced by feminist writers illuminatethe psychological mechanics of battering relationships. Regardless of the gender ofthe people involved, a battering relationship has specific psychological characteris-tics that have long-lasting and very destructive effects on anyone caught in it. Threeimportant concepts include the cycle of violence, coercive control, and traumaticbonding.
What is Lenore Walker’s model of the cycle of violence?
The psychologist Lenore Walker has written extensively about battered women. In aninfluential book entitled The Battered Woman, published in 1979, she introduced theconcept of the cycle of violence to describe a consistent pattern in the violent behavior
of batterers. Based on in-depth interviews with battered women, Walker describedthree phases of the cycle of violence: the tension-building phase , the acute battering
incident, and the honeymoon phase . The tension-building phase precedes the acute
battering incident. In this period, the bat-terer grows increasingly explosive andaggressive. There may be verbal abuse,temper explosions at minor frustrations,and an unpredictable building of tension.At this point, the battered woman knowsthat a serious explosion may occur at anymoment, and she works overtime toappease her partner and avert what sheultimately knows is inevitable. She tip-toes around her partner, constantly walk-ing on eggshells.
Over a period of time—the length
of which can vary from a matter of daysto several years—the tension escalatesuntil it finally explodes into a violentassault, known as the acute battering
421THE PSYCHOLOGY OF TRAUMA

stairs. There can also be forced sexual activity. The abuse can go on for hours,sometimes ending only when the abuser is exhausted and has successfully releasedall his tension. In the honeymoon phase, the batterer expresses remorse, promisesto change, and works hard to win back the woman’s love. Alternatively, he maythreaten suicide if she wants to leave, or try to woo her back with heightened affec-tion, gifts, and romantic attention. This continues until the tension-building phasebegins anew. While Walker’s theory has been quite influential in the study andtreatment of domestic violence, it has also been criticized as overly simplistic andnot applicable to all cases of domestic violence. Nonetheless, most clinicians wouldagree that it is descriptive of some cases of domestic violence.
What is Evan Stark’s model of coercive control?
In 2007, Evan Stark published a book entitled Coercive Control: How Men EntrapWomen in Personal Life . Stark’s ideas about coercive control were not new; in fact,
they dated back to the 1970s. But after thirty years of working with battered women,Stark felt that the field of domestic violence had abandoned its feminist roots for anoverly narrow focus on physical violence. In his view, it is the psychological aspects ofthe battering relationship that are the most damaging. Coercive control refers to the
systematic attempts to psychologically dominate the battered women. Stark felt thatthis is at the core of all battering relationships.
Batterers use a broad range of tactics, which can include: micromanaging of the
most intimate details of the victim’s life (e.g., dress, personal appearance, diet), para-noid levels of possessiveness, suspiciousness and sexual jealousy, verbal abuse andname calling, unpredictable outbursts over minor or even imaginary infractions, iso-lating the battered woman from all sources of social support, and continuous low lev-els of physical aggression (e.g., hair pulling, arm grabbing, shoving, pushing). Thesetactics create a climate of fear and self-doubt which, in turn, serves to break down thevictim’s self-esteem, sense of autonomy, and capacity to resist the batterer’s domina-tion. The serious assaults, when they come, only reinforce the victims’ helplessness.The violence does not stand on its own; it is part of a larger program to break downthe victim and to effectively hold her hostage.
How is domestic abuse similar to other forms of coercive control?
As several writers have noted, the tactics of coercive control used in battering rela-tionships are remarkably similar to tactics used in other situations of captivity andterror. Political prisoners, cult members, and young girls “seasoned” into prostitutionare frequently exposed to tactics of coercive control. The goal is always the same, tobreak down the self-confidence and autonomous sense of self of the victims, and leavethem at the psychological mercy of their captors.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 422Who is Patty Hearst and why is she still remembered today?
On February 4, 1974, 19-year-old
Patty Hearst, granddaughter of
the newspaper magnate WilliamRandolph Hearst, was kidnapped offthe campus of the University of Cali-fornia at Berkeley. A group callingthemselves the Symbionese Libera-tion Army took responsibility for thecrime. For months, Patty was lockedin a closet, beaten, and raped. InApril 1974, she was photographedtaking part in a bank robbery. In Sep-tember 1975, she was arrested forarmed robbery. Prosecutors arguedthat she had willingly engaged incriminal behavior because she hadfailed to escape her abductors, eventhough she had ample opportunitiesto do so. Patty Hearst was foundguilty and sentenced to 35 years in jail, which was later shortened to s even years.
After only 21 months in prison, her sentence was commuted by PresidentJimmy Carter. Years later she would write of her ordeal and describe how thepsychological effects of torture and captivity led her to identify with and thencooperate with her kidnappers’ demands, even when she was technically freeto escape.

423What did Judith Herman say about the psychological effects of captivity?
In 1992 Judith Herman (1942–) published a book entitled Trauma and Recovery,
which looked at the psychological effects of traumatic abuse from domestic abuse topolitical terror. Her chapter on the effects of captivity has particular relevance to thediscussion of domestic violence. In effect, captivity can produce a form of brainwash-ing. In a severe battering situation, the batterer holds the victim captive. By control-ling the victims’ entire world—their sleep-wake cycle, their diet, their physical safetyand, most importantly, their access to other people—batterers can gradually take overtheir victims’ mind. Through constant verbal abuse and through the degradation ofthe physical abuse, the victim loses any sense of self-worth. Her confidence in her abil-ity to control her environment is shattered. Her very sense of what is real is destroyedas the batterer controls the information that is available to her, and constantly deniesHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 423her own sense of reality. Moreover, by keeping other people away, batterers remove
any outside reality check on their distorted worldview.
A particularly powerful way to break down victims’ sense of self is to make them
betray their own moral values. The victim may be forced to engage in emotionally dis-turbing sexual behavior or to participate in the abuse of another victim. Similar tech-niques are used in the brainwashing or “breaking down” of prisoners or cult members. Acritical implication of this work is that, under the right circumstances, anyone can suf-fer the same psychological effects. Likewise, anyone can get into a battering relation-ship. Of course, certain people are more vulnerable to abusive relationships than others.People with a history of child abuse or domestic violence in childhood may be more vul-nerable to entering into and staying in a battering relationship. Similarly, younger peo-ple and people with significant psychological problems may also be more vulnerable.
What is traumatic bonding?
Traumatic bonding is another concept that helps us understand the power of the bat-tering relationship. When people are under extreme stress, there is an intensified needto form powerful emotional bonds with other people. For example, soldiers in battleoften form lifelong ties to other soldiers in their unit. Because of the acute trauma ofthe battering relationship, the victim also feels an intensified need for social bonds.But because of the victims’ social isolation, they have no one to turn to besides theirbatterers. In this way, victims develop great emotional dependency on the very personwho is causing them such pain.
Why do battered women stay?
There are many reasons that battered women stay in a relationship, even though itcan seem unfathomable to outside observers. First, there are often practical reasons,such as legal, economic, financial, and cultural considerations. Secondly, they havegood reason to fear for their safety, and even their life, if they leave. Thirdly, the psy-chological effects of the battering relationship serve to break down self-confidence tothe point that it can feel impossible to leave.
What are the practical reasons that battered women stay?
Although this is less true now than it was several decades ago, on a purely practical level itis often very difficult for a battered woman to leave her abuser. Inadequate financialmeans, inadequate legal protection, and lack of support by family and/or clergy can allhinder a battered woman’s escape. Although there is now much greater public awarenessof domestic violence than there was in previous decades, battered women still may nothave the resources or support they need to survive on their own, particularly if they havechildren.

However, Nussbaum was also a victim of Joel Steinberg’sabuse.

What are the psychological reasons that battered women stay?
The whole aim of coercive control is to break down the independence of the victim.The verbal abuse, terror, unpredictability, and enforced social isolation all powerfullyserve to crush a victim’s sense of self and even her sense of reality. A psychologicallybroken woman may not feel she is capable of living without her batterer. This is whyso many women return to their batterer after they have left him.
How does domestic violence affect the children?
There is no question that domestic violence has terrible effects on children. Childrenexperience similar forms of psychological damage from witnessing domestic violenceas they do from being a victim of it. Both child victims and child witnesses of physicalabuse report higher levels of depression, aggression, problems in relationships, andproblems in school. In sum, children who witness domestic violence are victims of ittoo. Moreover, children who are raised in violent homes can grow up thinking thatviolence in intimate relationships is normal. As adults, they are more likely to physi-cally abuse their own partners, or to marry someone who will physically abuse them.
Do only men batter?
Early feminist scholars insisted that spousal battery was an overwhelmingly male phe-nomenon. However, a number of studies investigating couples in the community sug-gest that women were actually more likely than men to commit violence, especially
425THE PSYCHOLOGY OF TRAUMAHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 425How did a famous 1994 murder trial draw attention
to the issue of domestic abuse in the United States?
The 1994 murder of Nicole Simp-
son and Ronald Goldman caused
an enormous scandal. O.J. Simpson,a popular former football player andNicole’s estranged husband, wasarrested for the murders after a dra-matic, televised car chase. There wasa documented history of domesticviolence in the Simpson family, withpolice records of multiple 911 callsmade by Nicole during O.J.’s violentoutbursts. There were also graphicphotographs of Nicole’s bruised facetaken years before the murder.
Despite what the defense des -
cribed as an airtight case, O.J. wasacquitted. His attorney, JohnnyCochran, skillfully turned the jury’s focus from the guilt or innocence of O.J.Simpson to the credibility of the Los Angeles Police Department. Simpson waslater found guilty in a wrongful death civil suit. After the trial, considerablemedia attention was given to the ongoing racial divisions in the United Statesrevealed by public response to this inter-racial scandal. Unfortunately, this high-ly publicized case brought little attention to the problem of domestic violence.

426mild forms of violence. In a 2007 study of 607 college students, Rosemarie Cogan and
Tiffany Fennell found that 53 percent of women and 38 percent of men reported com-mitting physical aggression toward an intimate partner. In a 2006 study by SusanO’Leary and Amy Slep, 453 cohabitating couples with young children reported similarresults. Women admitted to a median of three acts of mild physical aggression andtwo acts of severe physical aggression in the past year, compared to men, who admit-ted to two mild acts and one severe act in the past year. Additionally, both males andfemales perceive female-initiated violence to be less dangerous and problematic thanmale-initiated violence.
Criminal statistics, however, tell a different story than the research quoted above.
Men are far more likely to be involved in criminal assaults against a partner than arewomen and female homicide by an intimate partner is far more common than theHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 426THE PSYCHOLOGY OF TRAUMA
427reverse. In fact, murder by an intimate partner is the most frequent form of female
homicide. Taken together, these findings suggest that American women are equally ifnot more likely than men to engage in mild to moderate aggression, but that men arestill much more likely to engage in serious and life-threatening violence against theirintimate partners.
What are the criminal statistics about intimate partner violence?
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, from 2001 to 2005, 0.4 percent of womenand 0.09 percent of men reported an assault by an intimate partner to the police peryear. This accounted for 21.5 percent of all nonfatal assaults for women and 3.6 percentfor men. Further, in 2005, 1,181 women and 329 men were murdered by intimate part-ners. Between 1976 and 2005, 30.1 percent of female murders and 5.3 percent of malemurders were committed by intimate partners. Thus women are 3.6 times more likelythan men to be murdered by an intimate partner and 4.4 times more likely to suffernonfatal intimate partner assaults. The good news, though, is that the incidence of allviolent crimes by intimate partners has decreased dramatically over the last few decades.
Does the rate of domestic violence vary across cultures?
Rates of domestic violence, particularly violence against women, appear to vary drastical-ly across cultures. According to a 2009 report by the World Health Organization, the life-time rate of spousal battery among ever-partnered women ranged from 15 to 72 percent.Rural areas had much higher rates of spousal abuse than urban areas. The lifetime rate ofsexual or physical violence from an intimate partner was 72 percent in rural Ethiopia, 69percent in rural Peru, and 62 percent in rural Bangladesh. The rate was 15 percent inurban Japan, 24 percent in urban Serbia and Montenegro, and 29 percent in urban Brazil.Although the annual rate of spousal abuse was much lower than the lifetime rate, abusewas rarely a one-time thing. If it happened once, it was likely to occur again.
What affects the prevalence of violence against women?
Poverty, war, and political and economic instability lead to increased rates of violenceagainst women. Additionally, alcohol abuse and exposure to domestic violence as achild both increase the likelihood of domestic violence. Arguably, however, the mostimportant factor is the cultural attitude toward domestic violence and the rights ofwomen. When women have no rights and men feel entitled to treat women as proper-ty, domestic violence can become endemic.
How do women’s rights vary across countries?
The widespread acceptance of the equal rights of women is a fairly new phenomenon,arising only in the last four decades. While women now make up almost half the work-Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 427force in the United States and account for about 50 percent of law, medical, and doc-
toral degrees, only thirty-five years ago women accounted for a small fraction of theprofessions. According to the U.S. State Department’s 2003 report on internationalhuman rights, the movement toward equal rights for women in the developing worldis only just beginning.
In many Islamic countries, for example, the role of women is still extremely con-
stricted, and religious conservatives believe that women should be entirely subordinateto men. Consequently, legal rights for women vary drastically across countries. In mostdeveloped Western countries women have essentially the same legal rights as men. Inother countries, many things are forbidden to women: the legal right to work; to haveaccess to credit; to own property; to initiate a divorce; to have custody of the children;and even to have one’s testimony in court carry as much weight as a man’s testimony. Insome developing countries, such as South Africa, new, progressive laws support manyrights for women. However the enforcement of such laws is often quite lax, and popularacceptance, particularly in rural areas, is very low. In other countries, such as Saudi Ara-bia, women are not allowed to drive or to travel without a man accompanying them.
How do attitude towards domestic violence vary across cultures?
The feminist movement brought the problem of domestic violence to public attentiononly within recent decades. Most industrialized countries now recognize the problemand have laws against it. For example, in Canada there were 524 shelters for batteredwomen by 2002. In other developing countries, such as South Africa, there are lawsprohibiting domestic violence but enforcement is a problem and there is little govern-ment support for public education against domestic violence or for shelters for bat-tered women. Still other countries, such as Bulgaria or Zimbabwe, have no lawsagainst domestic violence. In many cultures, popular attitudes promote a tolerance ofdomestic violence. The problem is minimized by the family and community as well asby judicial and medical systems, and both men and women believe a man has the rightto physically “discipline” his wife.
428Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 428What is forensic psychology?
The word “forensic” refers to the legal system. Forensic matters include anything
related to the application and enforcement of the law, as well as the prosecution ofthose who violate the law.
Forensic psychology is a relatively new field but it is growing rapidly. Forensic
psychologists are involved with many aspects of both civil and criminal law. In mattersof civil law, they are involved with competency and disability evaluations, as well asdivorce mediation and custody evaluations. In criminal cases, they perform evalua-tions of the mental state of the defendant (particularly in insanity pleas), and provideexpert testimony on relevant psychological factors.
Forensic psychologists may also provide psychotherapy for prison inmates,
including specific programs for violent or sexual offenders. They also work directlywith law enforcement officials. They screen applicants for the police force and canprovide stress management, grief work, and trauma counseling to police officers andother members of law enforcement. Finally, forensic psychologists perform scientificresearch on such topics as the reliability of children’s testimony, recidivism of sexoffenders, impulsivity and aggression, and juvenile delinquency.
What is criminal profiling?
Criminal profiling involves the attempt to identify psychological, demographic, and

Over the past thirtyyears or so, criminal profiling has become very popular in law enforcement and is now awidespread practice in many different countries. Its popularity is reflected in the NBC-TVshow called Profiler. While there have been a number of attempts to develop theories andsystems of criminal profiling, there is very little actual scientific evidence to show that it

THE PSYCHOLOGY
OF CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR
What can psychology tell us about criminal behavior?
Any kind of criminal behavior involves a conscious choice to violate the law—if thebehavior is accidental or unintentional, it is not criminal. While we know that many envi-ronmental factors—including poverty, neighborhood crime rates, social norms, and lackof opportunities for legal employment—contribute to the incidence of criminal behavior,psychological factors also play an integral role in the choice to commit criminal acts.
Do all law-breakers have abnormal psychological traits ?
Not everyone who breaks the law has abnormal psychological traits. Illegal behaviorcan be motivated by many different factors. However, there are certain psychologicalfeatures that make some people more likely to engage in criminal behavior than others.
Is there a criminal mind?
For quite a few decades, the mental health field has attempted to classify and study thepersonality traits of people most likely to engage in criminal behavior. In other words,they have tried to diagnose the criminal mind. In the latest edition of the official Diag-nostic and Statistical Manual of mental disorders, DSM-IV and DSM-IV-TR, the diag-nosis of antisocial personality disorder describes people who habitually violate social
norms and moral codes.
What is antisocial personality disorder?
People with antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) are characterized by callous andexploitive behavior and by a lack of empathy or remorse. According to DSM-IV, a per-son with this disorder demonstrates a pervasive pattern of disregard for the rights ofothers as evidenced by at least three of the following criteria: repeatedly engaging inillegal behavior; frequently lying, using aliases, or conning others for personal profit;impulsivity and lack of future planning; irritability and aggressiveness; reckless disre-
430Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 430gard for the safety of self and others; consistent irresponsibility, with repeated failures
to sustain employment or fulfill financial obligations; lack of remorse as evident inindifference to, or rationalization of, hurting, mistreating, or stealing from others.This definition has been criticized, however, for being too focused on behavior insteadof personality traits, and for requiring evidence of conduct disorder (a childhood vari-ant of ASPD) before the age of fifteen.
What is psychopathy?
The concept of psychopathy should be distinguished from the DSM-IV concept of anti-social personality disorder. While diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder is heavilydependent on a record of criminal behavior, psychopathy is more geared to the actualpersonality traits associated with criminal behavior. Such traits include callousness,superficial and shallow emotion, lack of empathy, irresponsibility, lack of remorse orguilt about harming others, and the tendency to exploit, manipulate and engage inpredatory behavior toward others.
Psychopathic prisoners commit more serious and violent crimes than non-psy-
chopathic prisoners. They are also more likely to recidivate (commit another crime)after they are released from prison. Moreover, psychopaths are more likely to commit

Porter’s 2002 study of 125 prisoners convicted of homicide, the thirty-four psycho-pathic prisoners were much more likely than the ninety-one non-psychopathic prison-ers to have committed premeditated murders (93.3 percent vs. 48.4 percent).
How is psychopathy measured?
The foremost expert on psychopathy today is a psychologist named Robert Hare (1934–).He has developed an intensive interview to measure psychopathy named the Hare Psy-chopathy Checklist. His first version was published in 1980 and the revised version (PCL-R) in 1991. The PCL-R is a twenty-item clinical rating scale that is scored based on infor-mation from a semi-structured interview and available legal files and medical records.Collateral interviews with someone who knows the subject well are also conducted, aspsychopathic individuals are not always reliable informants. Although the maximum pos-sible score is 40, the average scores in both male and female offender populations rangefrom about 22 to 24. Hare uses a cut-off score of 30 to distinguish psychopaths from non-psychopaths. He believes that psychopathy is more of a category than a dimension. Thismeans that someone either is or is not a psychopath. Notably, some other researchersdisagree and believe that psychopathic traits fall on a continuum.
How common is psychopathy?
Hare estimates that about 50 to 75 percent of the prison population meets criteria forantisocial personality disorder, but only 15 to 25 percent exceed the cut-off point forpsychopathy. Hare also estimates that psychopaths make up about one percent of thegeneral population. Thus, psychopathy appears to be a more severe disorder than anti-social personality disorder, but fortunately a less common one.
What are the different dimensions of psychopathy?
In Hare’s initial research, he conducted a factor analysis on a large sample of prisonerswho had been administered the PCL-R. Factor analysis identifies scale items that clus-ter together and is used to create subscales of a measure. Two factors were identified,the interpersonal/affective factor (factor 1) and the socially deviant lifestyle factor (fac-tor 2). In 2003, Hare modified his original model with a new 4-factor model. Factor 1was divided into an interpersonal factor (impression management, grandiosity, patho-logical lying, and manipulativeness) and an affective factor (lack of remorse, shallowaffect, callous/lacking empathy, and failure to acknowledge responsibility). Factor 2was divided into a lifestyle factor (stimulation seeking, parasitic, lacking goals, impul-sive, and irresponsible) and an antisocial factor (aggressive, early behavior problems,serious criminal behavior, engagement in different types of crimes). Other authorshave proposed a 3-factor model, dividing Factor 1 as Hare did, but keeping Factor 2 asa behavioral factor. Over the years, new instruments similar to the Hare PCL-R havebeen developed and have yielded similar factor structures.
432Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 432What is the difference between antisocial behavior and antisocial attitudes?
One of Hare’s most important findings involves the distinction between Factor 1 and
Factor 2. This research suggests that psychopathy is made up of two relatively distinctpersonality traits, antisocial attitudes and antisocial behavior. The first trait reflectscold, callous personality features. The second trait reflects impulsive-aggression andpoor behavioral control. These traits may have different causes, differ in their underly-ing neurobiology, and predict to different types of behavior. Although the two factorscorrelate at 0.5, suggesting about 25 percent overlap, they are really quite distinct.
What does Hare’s Factor 1 correlate with?
Factor 1 includes the emotional and interpersonal aspects of psychopathy, the cal-lous, manipulative and egocentric qualities—in other words, the core personalitytraits. Factor 1 is correlated with measures of narcissistic and histrionic personalitydisorder and Machiavellian traits. Factor 1 is also correlated with level of violence,risk of recidivism (repeat crimes), and abnormal emotional processing (low anxiety,low empathy). Factor 1 is not correlated with age, education, or socioeconomic sta-tus (SES).
What does Hare’s Factor 2 correlate with?
Factor 2 relates to antisocial behavior and the deviant lifestyle. Factor 2 is correlatedwith measures of substance abuse, criminal behaviors, and antisocial personality dis-order. It is also negatively correlated with IQ, education, SES, and age. In other words,

ior. This also means that as people get older, their antisocial behavior decreases. How-ever, core psychopathic personality traits do not appear to be related to age, nor arethey necessarily related to other demographic features, such as SES and education.
What role do narcissistic traits play in antisocial attitudes and behavior?
Antisocial individuals have a good deal of narcissistic features and there is some over-lap between the two personality types. Nonetheless, it is important to distinguishbetween the two. Narcissism is not the same as antisocial personality and many highlynarcissistic people do not show antisocial traits. As is shown in Hare’s scale, grandiosi-ty, lack of empathy, and a tendency to use others for one’s own ends are commonamong psychopathic individuals. And the DSM-IV definition of narcissistic personalitydisorders lists grandiosity, lack of empathy, and the expectation that others willaccommodate to the individual’s desires as criteria for the disorder. In true psychopa-thy, however, there is little room for interpersonal relationships. Other people simplydo not matter; they are solely means to an end. In narcissism, on the other hand,there is often a strong emphasis on interpersonal relationships, along with greatdependence on others’ approval and validation. Narcissists may be self-obsessed butthey are not necessarily cold, cruel, or sadistic. Nonetheless, under the proper condi-tions, highly narcissistic people can veer into criminal behavior. The desire for riches,fame, and power, along with the grandiose belief of being above the limits of normalpeople, can lead such individuals to cross over legal and ethical lines.
What role does intellectual ability play in criminal behavior?
The majority of criminal behavior is related to impulsivity and impulsive aggression,and intellectual ability is strongly related to impulsivity. A large literature shows astrong correlation between antisocial behavior and lowered performance on a range ofcognitive tests. In effect, impulsivity means acting without thinking. Therefore, theability to reason through situations is a critical component of behavioral control. Thisentails the ability to consider alternative explanations of events and alternative solu-tions to problems. Most importantly, one must be able to anticipate future conse-quences. It is worth noting that reduced cognitive abilities are related to behavioral
problems, as measured by Hare’s Factor 2.
Less is known about the relationship between cognitive function and the core psy-
chopathic personality traits of Hare’s Factor 1. Certainly there have been very brilliant
psychopaths throughout history, and many have risen to positions of great power. Suchpeople are not impulsive and are very capable of planning ahead. Nonetheless, there issome evidence of subtle cognitive abnormalities in psychopaths, specifically with regardto attention. Several studies have revealed over-focused attention in psychopaths; theyonly attend to their goal and are relatively unresponsive to peripheral information.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 434Was the Enron scandal an example of psychopathic
traits on the part of corporate executives?
Enron was an enormous energy
company based in Texas that
quickly rose to national prominencein the 1990s. CEO Ken Lay was amajor contributor to political cam-paigns, and a warm acquaintance ofU.S. presidents and other high-levelpoliticians. Enron collapsed in 2001due to a vast web of fraudulentaccounting. This cost tens of thou-sands of jobs and billions of dollars.Lay, along with executive JeffreySkilling and his protégé Andrew Fas-tow, were all convicted of fraud andsentenced to prison.
Were these men typical psy-
chopaths? Would they meet criteriafor antisocial personality disorder?Although we can only guess outside of an in-person clinical interview, it is morelikely that all three men fell victim to their own narcissism. Seduced by thepower, wealth, and glory of their enormous success, they chose to keep theirprofits growing, even if they had to cross ethical and legal lines in the process.The life savings of thousands of Enron employees became less important thantheir own ambition. We can also question the societal values that place such pri-ority on financial success, ultimately encouraging the kind of financial misbe-havior uncovered in the Enron scandal.
While the greed of some corporate titans might seem
psychopathic, it is unlikely they would meet the full criteria forantisocial personalitry disorder ( iStock).FORENSIC PSYCHOLOGY
435Do criminals “age out”?
There is clear evidence that criminals tend to age out. Most serious and violent crimes
are committed by people under the age of forty. According to Cathy Widom andMichael Maxfield, the core age for criminal behavior is from twenty to twenty-five.Moreover, Factor 2 on Hare’s Psychopathy Checklist, which measures antisocialbehavior, is negatively correlated with age. Thus, there is a general reduction ofimpulsive-aggressive and reckless behavior as people get older. This reduction mayalso relate to the fact that older people have less energy and physical vigor thanyounger people. However, planful criminal behavior that makes minimal physicalHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 435demands on the criminal is less likely to diminish with age. As Hare’s data shows, the
psychopathic personality traits (Factor 1) do not decrease with age but are stable overtime. That is why psychopathic people who have underlings to carry out their antiso-cial behavior, such as murderous dictators and kingpins of organized crime, can con-tinue to engage in criminal activity well into their eighties.
CAUSES OF ANTISOCIAL TRAITS
What are the causes of antisocial traits?
There is a large literature on the risk factors for criminal behavior. Research points toa multitude of risk factors, including genetic, cognitive, personality, family, and com-munity influences. Of note, however, this research does not distinguish between anti-social behavior and psychopathic personality traits.
What role does environment play in the development of antisocial traits?
Environment plays an extremely important role in the development of antisocialtraits. It is no coincidence that most of the people in jail for violent crimes comefrom lower socioeconomic levels and disadvantaged communities. Even though weare continually learning more about the biological and genetic contributions to anti-social behavior, it is critical to keep in mind that environment greatly shapes allaspects of human behavior. Environment even shapes much of human biology,including gene expression.
What role does neurobiology play in the development of antisocial traits?
The explosion in neurobiological research of the past few decades has shed more andmore light on the neurobiology underlying antisocial behavior. We now know muchmore about the brain areas involved in antisocial behavior, the kinds of biological con-ditions that contribute to antisocial behavior, and even genes that raise the risk ofantisocial behavior.
Is there an interaction between neurobiology and environment?
Current research shows that nature (genes and biology) and nurture (environment)interact throughout life. Our genes prime us toward certain personality traits and psy-chological abilities (for example, intelligence, verbal skills, risk tolerance). In effect,our genes set the parameters, or the outer limits, of our mental capacities. Our envi-ronment then determines whether we will meet our potential or fall below it. Ourenvironment also tells us what kinds of behaviors are socially acceptable and likely to
436Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 436be rewarded or punished. Moreover, when both genetic/biological and environmental
risk factors are present, antisocial traits are significantly amplified. For example, chil-dren with both biological vulnerabilities and high-risk environments show muchmore severe antisocial traits than children with either biological or environmentalvulnerabilities alone.
What social factors contribute to the development of antisocial behavior?
The relationship between individual and social risk factors is critically important.Poverty, poor education, inadequate community institutions, lack of appropriatesocial support systems, antisocial peers, and dangerous and violent neighborhoods canall have a devastating effect on an adolescent’s social and psychological development.Together, these factors greatly raise the risk of the child growing up to engage incriminal behavior.
In a 2002 study, Magda Stouthamer-Loeber and colleagues examined risk and pro-
tective factors for severe and persistent delinquency over a six-year period in a sampleof 871 boys. In particular, they looked at the impact of the general socioeconomic sta-tus (SES) of the neighborhood. Neighborhood SES was based on information from the1990 census, including data on median household income, number of single-parentfamilies, and percentage of families below the poverty line. Neighborhoods were divid-ed into four groups: high, medium, and low SES, and low SES with the majority ofresidents in public housing. In the boys aged thirteen to nineteen there was a clearrelationship between neighborhood SES and criminal behavior. The results showedthat 17.7 percent of the high SES group, 32.4 percent of the medium SES group, 41.7percent of the low SES group, and 69.4 percent of the low SES/public housing groupengaged in serious delinquent behavior. In other words, boys from the lowest SESneighborhood were almost four times more likely to engage in serious delinquentbehavior than boys from the highest SES neighborhood.
What role do social norms play in the determination of
criminal behavior?
Criminal behavior involves the violation of the law, which in most cases also involvesviolation of social norms. However, in subcultures in which criminal behavior issocially acceptable, such as adolescent gangs, terrorist groups, and organized crime,an individual’s participation in criminal behavior may be less a function of abnormalpsychology than of the identification with and desire to fit into a social group. In othercases, people join violent social groups not out of free choice but because of coercionfrom the particular group or a perceived need for protection from other violent,predatory groups. In disadvantaged, low SES neighborhoods where violent gangs aremore likely to flourish, this can have a devastating effect on the social development ofyoung people, and young men in particular.
437FORENSIC PSYCHOLOGYHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 437What factors in the family contribute to juvenile delinquency?
Faulty, inept or abusive parenting, parental psychopathology (such as depression), and
antisocial behavior in the siblings all increase the risk of a child engaging in antisocialbehavior.
What role does gender play in antisocial traits?
One obvious fact about criminal statistics is that criminals are predominantly male. Ina 2001 study by Cathy Widom and Michael Maxfield, there was a 2.5–1 male to femaleratio for any arrest among a sample of 667 young adults. For violent crime, the maleto female ratio increased to 6.7–1. In FBI statistics for 1998, women accounted for 22percent of all arrests, 8 percent of convicted violent felons, 23 percent of propertyfelons, and 17 percent of drug felons. Moreover, when female criminal behavior doesoccur, it is often in the company of a male.
Finally, female antisocial behavior may be more strongly linked to trauma and
abuse. For example, in a Widom and Maxfield’s study, abused women were 227 percentmore likely to commit a violent crime than non-abused women, while the rate of vio-lent crime only increased by 17 percent for abused men vs. non-abused men. We can-
438
Teen gangs are typically well-structured social groups with clear codes of acceptable behavior. When trying to understand gang
members’ behavior, it is probably more useful to consider the social environment where gangs tend to flourish than to focus on the
psychological traits of individual gang members. In other words, it is likely that gang members become violent because they hav e
been socialized to become that way in the gang ( iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 438not know the extent to which this gender difference is due to cultural or biological
influences. Given the predominance of male criminals across history and cultures,however, it is likely there is a strong biological component, possibly involving malehormones such as testosterone.
Does child abuse cause antisocial traits?
There is considerable evidence that a history of child abuse increases the likelihood ofcriminal activity in adolescence and adulthood. In their 2001 study, Cathy Widom andMichael Maxfield examined the arrest records of 1,575 individuals, including 908 indi-viduals with documented histories of child abuse or neglect and 667 non-abused con-trols who were matched to the first group for age, sex, race, and family socioeconomicstatus. All abuse cases occurred between 1967 and 1971 when the children were elevenyears of age or younger. By 1994, 27.4 percent of the abused/neglected group had arrestsas a juvenile compared to 17.2 percent of the non-abused group. In addition, 41.6 per-cent had arrests as adults compared to 32.5 percent of the non-abused group, and 18.1percent had been arrested for a violent crime vs. 13.9 percent of the non-abused group.Thus, abused children were about 60 percent more likely to be arrested as a juvenile and30 percent more likely to be arrested as an adult than non-abused children.
Do all abused children develop antisocial traits?
It is important to stress that the majority of abused children do not grow up to devel-op antisocial traits. According to some estimates, in fact, as much as one-third ofabused children grow up without significant psychological damage. However, the riskof the child developing antisocial traits increases with more severe abuse and with thepresence of other risk factors, such as poverty, poor schools, etc.
What psychological characteristics raise the risk of juvenile delinquency?
There are a number of psychological characteristics that raise the risk of later criminalbehavior. Poor cognitive and language ability, problematic and irritable temperament,poor self-control and self-regulation, low self-esteem, and inadequate social and inter-personal skills can all raise the risk of an individual engaging in criminal behavior.
What biological factors contribute to delinquency?
Poor nutrition, inadequate health care, prenatal exposure to illicit substances, andinadequate sleep all interfere with proper brain maturation, hindering social and cog-nitive development. Moreover, a number of genes have been identified that are associ-ated with reckless, poorly controlled behavior. Finally, biologically based mental con-ditions, such as attention deficit disorder and various learning disorders, also interferewith behavioral control and raise the risk of criminal behavior.
439FORENSIC PSYCHOLOGYHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 439What do we know about the neurobiology of psychopathic criminals?
Psychopathic individuals appear to be hyporeactive to emotional stimuli. In other
words, the emotional parts of the brains do not react as strongly to emotional stimulias the same parts of the brain in healthy people and even in non-psychopathic prison-ers. Likewise, a large body of literature shows that psychopaths have difficulty process-ing emotional information. Compared to non-psychopathic criminals, they are lessable to identify emotions as expressed in vocal tone, facial expression, or spoken sen-tences. Moreover, they may be particularly insensitive to sadness. Also, the two halvesof their cortex, the left and right hemispheres, are not well coordinated during cogni-tive tasks, and the left hemisphere may be less active than is typical for most people.This suggests that the emotional processes of the right hemisphere are not well coor-dinated with the verbal processes of the left hemisphere. This difficulty making senseof emotion may relate to the lack of empathy that is characteristic of psychopaths.
What do we know about the neurobiology of antisocial traits?
Modern research has taught us a good deal about the neurobiology of antisocial traits.It is important, however, to distinguish the neurobiological traits associated withimpulsivity and those associated with psychopathy, as they may be quite different. We
know that people with high levels of impulsivity and impulsive aggression have lessactivation in their orbital frontal region. This part of the frontal lobe lies just above

One study found that violent men whose heart rate went down during an argument with their wives had higher levels of aggressive -
sadistic tendencies ( iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 440the eye sockets and is associated with behavioral control. Some researchers suggest
that the orbital frontal cortex links planned behavior with memories of punishment.In other words, the person is more likely to reason, “Oh oh, if I hit this person, Imight get hit back.” When the orbital frontal cortex is compromised, the fear of pun-ishment is not strong enough to deter the person from impulsive and reckless actions.
There is also evidence of decreased function in the dorsolateral frontal cortex in
impulsive aggression. This area is involved in abstract and complex thought, abilitiesthat are often compromised in impulsive-aggressive people. The serotonin system mayalso be abnormal in impulsive people. The neurotransmitter serotonin also seems tobe involved in behavioral control. People with hyperactive serotonin systems may haveover-controlled behavior, while the opposite appears to be true with impulsive people,whose serotonin system is underactive.
How can we explain the biological findings on psychopathy?
To summarize, biological research into psychopathy has shown us that psychopathshave overly focused attention, are under-responsive to emotions, and become lessaroused instead of more aroused when they are angry. How might we understand thesefindings? One possibility is that psychopathic individuals grew up in very threateningand violent environments. As a consequence, they learned to down-regulate their emo-tional responses and narrow their attention in order to focus solely on getting what

What does heart rate tell us about psychopathy?
We may be able to distinguish psychopathic individuals from impulsive-aggressive individuals by measuring their heartbeat when they are angry.
In an important 1995 study by John Gottman and colleagues, 61 wife battererswere divided into two groups according to their heart rate during disagreementswith their wives. One group showed lowered heart rates during the disagree-
ment, while the heart rates of the other group went up. In other words, the firstgroup became less aroused during the disagreement rather than more aroused.
Compared to the second group, however, the low-heart-rate men displayed
more verbal aggression and anger during the discussion, while their wivesshowed more sadness and possibly more fear. Further, more of these men had ahistory of violence outside the family and of witnessing domestic violence aschildren. Finally, they scored higher on measures of antisocial and aggressive-sadistic personality disorder than the high-heart-rate men. In sum, the low-heart-rate batterers looked more typically psychopathic, while the high-heart-rate batterers looked more impulsive-aggressive.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 441they want and on surviving in a brutal, dog-eat-dog world. Unfortunately, what may
have started out as a way to survive brutality ultimately serves to perpetuate it.
Is there a genetic basis for antisocial traits?
There is growing evidence of a genetic basis for antisocial traits. In a 2008 twin study byMats Forman and colleagues, all 1,480 twins born in Sweden from 1985–1986 wereadministered the Youth Psychopathic Traits Inventory. By comparing correlationsbetween identical and fraternal twins, the authors concluded that psychopathic traitshave a strong genetic basis and that this is especially true for the impulsive/irresponsiblesubscale versus the grandiose/manipulative and callous/unemotional subscales. Someauthors estimate that genetics account for 40 to 50 percent of antisocial behavior. How-ever, it is difficult to know for sure how much of antisocial behavior is due to geneticsand how much is due to environment. For one, estimates of heritability (or genetics)
rely heavily on twin studies, in which the genetic differences are carefully measured butthe environmental differences are not. Moreover, twins tend to have quite similar envi-ronments. Thus, environmental contributions are probably underestimated.
What specific genes have been linked to antisocial traits?
One gene that has received a fair amount of attention is known as monoamine oxydaseA (MAOA) and codes for an enzyme (also called MAOA) involved with the metabolismof key neurotransmitters involved with emotion and behavior, specifically serotonin,
norepinephrine, and dopamine. A variant
of this gene reduces MAOA enzyme activi-ty and is more common in antisocialindividuals than in controls. It is likely,however, that this gene codes for impul-sivity rather than antisocial behavior perse. Another gene, called-G1438A, is relat-ed to the 5HT2A subtype of the serotoninsystem. One variant (or polymorphism)
of this gene, known as the G-allelle, isassociated with increased rule breakingin adolescent boys, as shown in a 2009study by S. Alexandra Burt. The othervariant, known as the A-allelle, is associ-ated with lower levels of rule breaking,and incidentally, lower levels of populari-ty with peers. In other words, boys withthe G-allele were both bigger rule break-ers and more popular.

Because of the criminal nature of the drug industry,
competition between rival drug dealers is often a horriblyviolent affair, resulting in countless drug-related deaths. Someanalysts believe that drugs should be made legal in order toreduce crime. Others believe legalizing drugs would onlyincrease drug addiction (iStock).Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 442What is the relationship between addiction and criminality?
Drug addiction is strongly correlated with impulsivity and many people with antisocial
traits also abuse illicit substances. Unfortunately, drug abuse and addiction also promote
antisocial behavior. For one, drug addiction can destroy an addicted individual’s abilityto hold a job, removing the means to pay for the drug. In this situation, drug addictsmay turn to crime in order to obtain the money needed to pay for their drug. Commonforms of criminal activity include robbery, drug dealing, and prostitution. Secondly,many drugs of abuse impair judgment and impulse control, which increases the likeli-hood of reckless and criminal acts. In fact, it has been estimated that 55 percent of caraccidents and more than 50 percent of murders involve alcohol intoxication. Thirdly,most Western countries outlaw the most common drugs of abuse. Unfortunately, thisfails to erase demand for the drugs. Consequently, the market for illicit drugs goesunderground and becomes the domain of criminals. Competition within the illicit drugtrade has led to a tremendous amount of violence, dating back many decades.
SPECIFIC FORMS OF CRIMES
What do we know about the psychology of violent criminals?
Most violent crime involves impulsive aggression. It is no surprise, then, to find that,on average, violent criminals have many of the characteristics associated with impul-sive aggression. They are largely male, young, have problems regulating their aggres-sion, and tend to have lower IQs, less education, and lower SES than the general pop-ulation. They are also more likely to have childhood histories of physical abuse andneglect. Cognitively, they have difficulty anticipating the consequences of theiractions, and tend toward a narrow, rigid, and essentially paranoid interpretation ofothers’ intentions. Ambiguous gestures are interpreted as threatening and hostile, set-ting off a hair-trigger aggressive reaction. Non-impulsive violent criminals are morelikely to have psychopathic traits; that is, they have the callous, exploitive, andunemotional traits of a psychopath.
What do we know about the psychology of nonviolent criminals?
Perpetrators of nonviolent crimes, such as property and drug offenses, are obvious-ly less violent than violent criminals. Likewise, they have less difficulty with con-trolling their aggression. These crimes are also associated with impulsivity, howev-er, and nonviolent criminals, on average, have many features associated withimpulsivity, such as younger age, lower IQ, and less education. Proportionately,females are considerably more likely to be convicted of a nonviolent than a violentcrime. About 20 percent of nonviolent felons are female according to FBI statistics,whereas only about 8 percent of violent felons are female.
443FORENSIC PSYCHOLOGYHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 443What do we know about child molesters?
Perhaps because of the extremely damaging effects of child sexual abuse, forensic psy-
chologists have put a fair amount of effort into studying sexual molesters of children.Child molesters tend to be older than other criminals and are probably not as impul-sive, although there is likely a subset of highly impulsive child molesters. Most childmolesters use bribery, manipulation, and seduction to access their victims, although asizeable proportion use instrumental force, that is, only enough force to attain theirgoals. Although there is a small fraction of highly violent child molesters, the vastmajority are not violent. While most child molesters are heterosexual males whomolest girls, the men who molest boys tend to have far more victims, hundreds orthousands in some instances. In general, the majority of child molesters have only afew victims, while a small fraction with persistent pedophilic tendencies can molesthundreds or thousands of children over a lifetime.
Are there different types of child molesters?
All professionals who work with child molesters are struck by the variety within thispopulation. There is clearly no one type of child molester. In a 2008 article, RobertPrentky, Raymond Knight, and Austen Lee proposed several subtypes of child moles-ters, based on their own clinical experience and the research literature. The mostimportant distinction is between fixated and regressed child molesters. Fixated child
molesters have a long-standing sexual attraction to pre-pubescent children. They havea higher rate of reoffending, show greater sexual arousal to pedophilic stimuli, andhave a much larger number of victims than other types of child molesters.
Regressed child molesters are not primarily pedophilic, but turn to children for sit-
uational reasons. They might have impulse control problems, poor social skills, psycho-pathic tendencies, or a substance abuse disorder. A second dimension involves socialcompetence. Some child molesters turn to children because they have inadequate socialskills to engage with adults. Together, this results in four categories: high fixation/lowsocial competence; high fixation/high social competence; low fixation/low social compe-tence; and low fixation/high social competence. Child molesters are then further differ-entiated according to the amount of contact, physical injury, and sadism involved.
Are homosexual child molesters really homosexual?
Male offenders against boys seem to be quite different from male offenders againstgirls. Nonetheless, it is unlikely that homosexual pedophiles have much in commonwith other homosexuals, that is, adult men who are sexually attracted to other adultmen. For one, a good percentage of homosexual pedophiles also molest girls, over 60percent in one study. Secondly, in an important 1988 study by William Marshall andcolleagues, about two-thirds of sexual offenders against boys showed greater sexualarousal to pictures of adult women than they did to pictures of adult men.
444Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 444Were most child molesters molested as children themselves?
Adults who sexually molest children have a disproportionately high rate of sexual
abuse in their own childhoods. Child molesters are more likely to have a childhoodhistory of sexual abuse than are nonsexual offenders and even sex offenders againstolder victims. According to a 1995 by Christopher Bagley and colleagues of a commu-nity-based, nonforensic sample, men who reported multiple events of sexual contactin their own childhood were almost forty times more likely to report having sexualcontact with children than men who reported no sexual abuse in childhood (7.7 per-cent vs. 0.2 percent).
How do sex offenders against children differ from those against adults?
In a 2007 study by Lisa Cohen and colleagues, data on 392 sexual offenders againstchildren and 209 sexual offenders against adults were taken from the New York StateSex Offenders Registry. Offenders against children were older, more likely to havemale victims or victims of both sexes, and less likely to use force or a weapon. Theyalso had less invasive offenses and were less likely to have sexual intercourse withtheir victim. In other words, compared to adult rapists, child molesters are older, lessviolent, and less focused on female victims.
What can psychology tell us about child testimony?
Sometimes children are called upon to testify in court. This is particularly relevant inchild abuse cases. How reliable is a child’s testimony? Research shows that childrenare just as capable as adults at recalling specific events accurately. Their memory,however, is highly susceptible to suggestion. In other words, they are easily led torecall things that did not actually happen, and then become convinced their newmemories are accurate. Because of this, the reliability of the testimony of children isheavily dependant on the interviewer’s technique. Interviewers who ask leading ques-tions, repeat the same question numerous times, or communicate a preference forone answer over another are more likely to extract inaccurate testimony from chil-dren. Additionally, children are easily intimidated by adult authority figures, particu-larly those in uniform, and may say what they believe the adult wants to hear ratherthan what they actually remember. The Kelly Michaels case is a tragic illustration ofwhat can happen when child testimony is misused.
How do white-collar criminals differ from other forms of criminals?
Most white-collar crimes take a higher level of planning, cognitive sophistication, andoccupational success than other crimes. Accountants, bookkeepers, or investmentbankers who siphon off tens of thousands of dollars tend to do so over a period ofmonths or years, all the while hiding their behavior from their colleagues. Moreover,
445FORENSIC PSYCHOLOGYHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 445their ability to attain a position of responsibility in the first place generally speaks to bet-
ter impulse control, planning, and ability to delay gratification than is found in the typi-cally impulsive criminal. Likewise, white-collar criminals tend to be more educated andcome from a higher SES background than other criminals. We can also speculate thatmany white-collar criminals have a high degree of narcissistic traits and find the allureof the money and the status that it can bring overwhelming. An inflated sense of entitle-ment dampens their guilt at stealing from other people. Consequently, they fail to inhib-it their illegal behavior. However, some white-collar criminals may also have antisocialor psychopathic traits, but are simply less impulsive than other types of criminals.
What do we know about the psychology of serial killers?
Luckily, serial killers are quite rare but they tend to get intensive media coveragewhen they come to public attention. Unfortunately, this may serve to encourage thebehavior. It is hard to determine exactly when a murderer becomes a serial killer. Onedefinition includes any one who commits at least four murders. Serial killers tend toact alone or with an accomplice and they generally kill strangers. Importantly, theykill for their own psychological gratification, rather than for money, power, or politicalpurposes. Most derive sexual pleasure from their crimes, which tend to be ritualisticand sadistic.
446What was the Kelly Michaels Case?
Kelly Michaels was a 26-year-old nursery school worker who fell victim to thewidespread hysteria about child molestation—particularly in day care cen-
ters—that occurred in the 1980s and early 1990s. In 1988, Michaels was convict-ed of 115 offenses related to child sexual assault, all of which allegedly took placeat the nursery school where she worked. Based on the testimony of 20 of herthree- to five-year-old charges, she was sentenced to 47 years in prison. The chil-dren’s allegations included bizarre and highly improbable sex acts, such asspreading peanut butter on their genitals and violating them with silverware andLego blocks. The absence of physical signs of abuse in any of the children failedto influence the outcome.
Michaels spent five years in prison before her case was overturned on appeal.
Examination of the interviews of the children revealed highly suspect tech-niques. Children were badgered, cajoled, and bribed into giving the desiredresponses. The children were simply too young to understand that they werebeing pressured to say things that were not true. Following cases like this,researchers turned their attention to the various ways children’s testimony canbe distorted and corrupted.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 446Forensic psychologists say that serial killers are motivated by the sense of
absolute power over their victims, and that they spend a good deal of time fantasizing
about and planning their crimes. Not surprisingly, most serial killers are profoundlyemotionally disturbed and many report traumatic and painful childhoods. In onesmall study from 1988, 69 percent reported a history of alcoholism in their family and74 percent reported psychological abuse in childhood. Nonetheless, serial killers donot tend to be very impulsive. In fact, the most successful serial killers can effectivelyplan their crimes and escape capture for decades.
What is the difference between organized and disorganized serial killers?
A popular theory among criminal profilers is that serial killers can be divided into twotypes according to their crime scene evidence. The first type is organized and has aplanful, thought-out approach to the crimes. These serial killers position the body,attempt to hide the body, tamper with the evidence, and take the weapon with them.Disorganized criminals are less careful and methodical. They use an improvised mur-der weapon, leave the body uncovered, leave a trail of clothing to the murder scene,and leave the victim’s belongings scattered about. The two types of serial killers arealso assumed to use different modes of torture, rape, and murder.
Surprisingly, this theory has had little scientific evidence to back it up. In a 2004
article, David Canter and colleagues tested the organized/disorganized classification bystudying the records of one hundred different serial killers. They found that all of theserial killers were predominantly organized in their approach. This makes perfect sense,given that serial killers are repeat murderers who manage to evade arrest for years. Dis-organized features were less common, but present to some degree in almost all subjects.
The authors suggested a new way of classifying serial killers, dividing them into
four new categories: those concerned with mutilation, execution, sexual control, orplunder. The first type mutilates the victim’s body, often after death. The second typeexecutes their victims quickly after they are finished with them. The third type sexual-ly tortures the victims while they are alive, presumably giving the killer a sense ofcomplete control over another person. The fourth type ransacks and plunders the vic-tims’ belongings.
MENTAL ILLNESS AND THE LAW
What is the relationship between mental illness and criminal behavior?
The relationship between mental illness and criminal behavior is a complicated one.Can mentally ill people be judged by the same standards as the rest of the population?Is it fair to punish someone who is incapable of rational thought the same way as
447FORENSIC PSYCHOLOGYHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 447someone who makes a conscious and rational decision to perform a criminal act? On
the other hand, should we excuse people from accountability just because they arepsychologically disturbed? How do we balance the right of the individual for fair treat-ment with the right of society for protection from antisocial acts? The legal systemaddresses these philosophical questions through the concepts of competence, culpa-bility, and mitigating factors.
What is the relationship between mental illness and competence?
The issue of mental competence comes up far more frequently than the problem ofmental illness and culpability. When people are competent, they are intellectually andemotionally capable of acting in their own best interest. In a criminal setting, this maymean being competent to stand trial or to participate in one’s own defense. On a civillevel, this may mean competent to manage one’s own finances, make medical deci-sions, or otherwise manage one’s own affairs. When someone is deemed incompetentto care for him or herself or to perform some specific task, a legal representative ischarged with making decisions for the incompetent person and is legally responsibleto act in the person’s best interest.
What is the relationship between mental illness and culpability?
In order for someone to be responsible, or culpable, for a criminal act, it is necessary to
have criminal intent. In other words, the person must have intentionally chosen to actin a criminal way. As intention is a psychological state—and one that is not always easyto prove—the individual’s mental state is relevant to the proof of criminal intent.
448What do we know about the psychology of serial killers
John Wayne Gacy and Jeffrey Dahmer?
Serial killers tend to get intense media coverage. Both Jeffrey Dahmer andJohn Wayne Gacy are well known serial killers. Dahmer was arrested in the
early 1990s, and Gacy in the late 1970s. Gacy was a mild mannered, apparentlylaw abiding man who sexually assaulted and murdered at least 30 young men.Interestingly, Gacy was also an artist, and painted bizarrely innocent and child-like pictures of nature scenes and of children’s cartoons, such as Disney’s sevendwarves. The planned and organized nature of his crimes, as well as the psycho-pathic split between respectability in public and murderous perversion in pri-vate, is characteristic of serial killers. Dahmer, on the other hand, showedextreme psychological disturbance from early on and had problems with alco-holism and sexual offenses from a young age. Both men died in prison.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 448Therefore, someone who is mentally ill, or
“insane,” may not have the psychologicalwherewithal to have criminal intent. Sucha person may not understand what he orshe is doing, or may not be able to controlhimself or herself. While most peopleagree that profoundly mentally ill peopleshould not be held to the same standardof accountability as the rest of the popula-tion, it is difficult to tell when mental ill-ness justifiably excuses criminal behavior.Can someone be mentally ill and still cul-pable? How do we define mental illness?
What does not guilty by reason of
insanity mean?
Not guilty by reason of insanity is a legal
defense that means that the individual isnot criminally responsible for an act he orshe committed because he or she is unableto form criminal intent due to insanity.Insanity is a legal term that is quite differ-ent from the clinical term. In the UnitedStates, the legal definition of insanityvaries from state to state. Most states specify that a person must be unable to appreciatethe nature and implications of their behavior or to understand that it was morallywrong. Other states include the inability to resist one’s impulses is the definition ofinsanity. Some states have no insanity defense at all. Under federal law, an insane personcannot “appreciate the nature and quality or the wrongfulness” of the criminal acts.
What does guilty but insane mean?
Within the last few decades, several states have adopted a guilty but mentally ill ver-
dict. The person is not excused from criminal liability due to insanity, but the courtrecognizes that mental illness played a role in the crime. Defendants with a guilty butmentally ill verdict are typically remanded to a psychiatric facility or provided withpsychiatric treatment while in prison.
How often is the insanity defense successful?
Surveys show many people view the insanity defense as an overused tactic exploited bywily criminals and unethical attorneys. Actually, it is used very rarely. An estimated

Who was the Unabomber?
Ted Kaczynski was strange even as a young child. As a six-month-old infant, he suf-fered a severe allergic reaction, breaking out in hives all over his body. He was in andout of the hospital for the next eight months, separated from his mother. From thetime he returned home, he was unresponsive to human interaction. Throughout hischildhood, he was extremely shy and painfully averse to human contact, especiallywith strangers and other children. At the same time he was extremely talented atmathematics, and single-mindedly focused on mastering mathematical problems.
Although he was never diagnosed, this description is certainly suggestive of
autism or Asperger’s syndrome. Evidently, his mother considered this possibility aswell, and thought of sending him to Bruno Bettelheim, a famous psychoanalyst whospecialized in autism.
Kaczynski entered Harvard at age 16, received his Ph.D. in mathematics at the
University of Michigan, where he performed brilliantly, and then accepted an academ-ic position at the University of California at Berkeley. Unfortunately, the teachingrequirements were too much for him; he was simply incapable of managing the inter-
450Was Andrea Yates legally insane
when she killed all five of her children?
By all accounts, Andrea Yates was a devoted wife, a devout Christian, and aconscientious mother of five small children. Unfortunately, she was also
mentally ill. She had been hospitalized several times for psychosis and depres-sion and treated with both antidepressant and antipsychotic medication. Shehad also twice attempted suicide.
On June 20, 2001, Yates drowned each of her five children in her bathtub
and then called the police to report what she had done. Yates claimed that Satanhad possessed her and that she needed to kill her children before Satan pos-sessed them as well. If they died while they were still pure they would get intoheaven. Otherwise, they would be damned to hell for all eternity.
Although her defense attorneys entered a plea of not guilty by reason of
insanity, she was found guilty of murder in a 2002 verdict and sentenced to lifeimprisonment. Her verdict was overturned in 2006, after it was revealed that oneof the prosecution’s expert witnesses had given false testimony. She was thenfound not guilty by reason of insanity and remanded to a state hospital.Handy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 450personal demands. He left Berkeley and, with his brother, bought a cabin in the Mon-
tana woods. He moved in there alone and became increasingly isolated, even cuttingoff contact from his mother and brother.
As he cultivated the skills to become entirely self-sufficient in the wilderness, he
also developed his anti-technology ideology. For years he had become disillusioned withtechnology and disgusted with human destruction of the natural world. He came tobelieve that the only way to destroy the “techno-industrial system” was by violent resis-tance, so in the late 1970s he began a bombing campaign against people linked withtechnology, including science and engineering professors, computer store owners, andthe airline industry. The FBI named him UNABOMB: university and airline bomber.
Over the next 18 years, he sent 16 bombs, injuring 23 people and killing three. In
1995, he published a manifesto, outlining his anti-technology ideology. His brotherDavid recognized Kaczynski’s writings from the manifesto and eventually contactedthe FBI. Ted Kaczynski was arrested in 1996. His defense attorneys entered an insanityplea and a court-appointed psychiatrist diagnosed him with paranoid schizophrenia.Kaczynski vigorously rejected this diagnosis, as he did not want his political missionto be dismissed as the rantings of a psychotic man. He plead guilty and was sentencedto life imprisonment without parole but was spared the death penalty because of hisbrother’s intervention.
Was Kaczynski insane? He almost certainly had a diagnosable psychiatric disorder
of some kind. However, he was very clear about his intentions and could rationallyargue the merits of his violent acts. Whether or not he was mentally ill, he clearly hadcriminal intent.
What does mitigating factor mean?
Evidence of psychological disturbance is effectively used to prove mitigating factors.In this case, the defendant is found guilty of the crime, but evidence of mental distur-bance is taken into account during sentencing. The burden of proof in these cases ismuch lower than in an insanity defense.
How does neurobiological research into criminality affect the law?
The remarkable advances in brain imaging technology in recent years have allowed usto discover much about the neurobiology of antisocial personality traits and behavior.For example, on average, violent felons have reduced functioning in the frontal lobe
and psychopathic prisoners have under-responsive amygdalas. But what does thismean for responsibility? Are violent criminals less culpable if their brains are abnor-mal? Are psychopaths less accountable if their brain is less able to process empathy?
Presumably small differences in brain function should not be a “get out of jail
free” card. Most psychologists agree that people need to be held accountable to the
451FORENSIC PSYCHOLOGYHandy Psychology  10/20/10  12:03 PM  Page 451extent that they have choice and control over their actions. On the other hand, brain
abnormalities can be used as evidence of mitigating factors. For example, a nonviolentfirst offender might receive a lesser sentence if there is evidence of recent head trau-ma. Most importantly, however, neurobiological research can help with treatment andprevention of antisocial behavior, to protect society from future crimes.
What is the relationship between personality disorders and culpability?
Personality disorders are defined as persistent patterns of thought, emotion, behavior,and interpersonal relationships that are abnormal for the person’s culture and causedistress and dysfunction. With 11 separate personality disorder diagnoses in the fourthedition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), per-sonality disorders are recognized as valid psychiatric conditions. Does the presence ofa personality disorder remove culpability for criminal behavior? This is especially ofconcern, given that some personality disorders are associated with, or even defined by,antisocial behavior. In other words, the use of a personality disorder diagnosis in acriminal defense could lead to absurdly circular thinking: I am not responsible for my
criminal behavior because I have antisocial personality disorder, which is defined bymy criminal behavior.
Personality disorders differ from psychotic disorders, however, in that the cogni-
tive abnormalities are mild. The problem is more one of motivation and disturbedinterpersonal relations. Therefore, there is no reason that a personality disorder wouldleave someone incapable of forming criminal intent. In sum, the diagnosis has much
more relevance for clinical settings than for legal ones.
